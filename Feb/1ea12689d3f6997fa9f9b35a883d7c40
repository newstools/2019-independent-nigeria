Ughelli – Chief Great Ogboru, Delta State All Progressive Congress (APC) governorship candidate, has promised to end the crises between Aladja and Ogbe-Ijoh communities if elected as the governor come March 2nd. The governorship hopeful, Chief Ogboru, gave this assurance at Ogbe-Ijoh, Warri South/West Local Government Area when his campaign team visited His Royal Majesty, Couple Mackson Oromoni, the Pere of Ogbe-Ijoh Kingdom. Ogboru said he would do all within his reach to ensure there is peace and harmony between the two warring communities if he is voted into power as the Delta State governor come March 2nd, pointing out that the crisis has been on over the years, but that because PDP has exhausted its ideas could not help the situation. Meanwhile, the Ogboru Campaign train also stormed Warri South yesterday, canvassing supports for President Muhammadu Buhari and senatorial and House of Reprehensive candidates ahead of Saturday election. The Ogboru campaign train, which was described as mother rally in the oil city of Warri, left no stone unturned with the impression that nothing will stop residents of the area from not casting their votes for President Buhari and other candidates on Saturday as a vote for the total transformation of Delta. The Ogboru Campaign Train, which held Warri standstill with over 7000 supporters were assured total victory in the Saturday 16th Feb and 2nd March with the power of their Permanent Voters Card, PVC. While charging Deltans to turn out en masse to reelect President Muhammadu Buhari, Sen. Ovie Omo-Agege and vote Dr. Emmanuel Uduaghan and other candidates on Saturday, Ogboru said PDP has over exhausted all they had and has nothing new to offer Deltans.

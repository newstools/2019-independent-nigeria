LAGOS – Asisat Oshoala has received congratulatory messages on her recent move to FC Barcelona Femeni of Spain, from some Lagos State school pupils, who rolled out a banner to show their delight with her January transfer. The pupils, who are enjoying part of the largesse currently being doled out by Oshoala’s charity foundation in Lagos, were happy to use the moment to felicitate with their noble benefactor. They are all beneficiaries of the latest effort by Asisat Oshoala Foundation, which stepped up by earmarking a full week to donate sports and educational materials to Lagos schools. The pupils took to social media to reveal their delight for Oshoala’s immense strides at club level, while also noting the value of the gifts they have received from her, and the three-time African Women Footballer of The Year replied with just two words: “My Kids.” Oshoala it would be recalled joined Liverpool Ladies on January 23, 2015. She missed two months of the 2015 season with a knee injury, as Liverpool finished seventh of eight teams. In January 2016 Liverpool reported that a transfer bid from Arsenal Ladies had activated the release clause in Oshoala’s contract and that she was discussing personal terms with the London club. On February 10, 2017, Chinese club Dalian Quanjian F.C. officially signed Oshoala and just last week, January 31, she signed for FC Barcelona Femeni side on a loan deal till the end of the season.

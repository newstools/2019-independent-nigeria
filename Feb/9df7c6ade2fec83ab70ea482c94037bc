The industrial sector attracted a total of N6.20 trillion from banks in the last four years despite downturns in the Nigerian economy within the period, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) has said. The Data sourced from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) by our correspondent, showed that the industrial sector got the loans in the period 2015 to 2018 The industrial sector is divided into four: mining and quarrying; manufacturing; oil and gas; and power and energy. Analysis of the data showed that the lenders favoured oil and gas and manufacturing more than mining and quarrying as well as power and energy. The industrial activity that attracted the highest credit within the period is oil and gas which got a total of N3.55 trillion. The manufacturing sub-sector was next, behind oil and gas, by attracting N2.23 trillion credits within the period. Power and energy got N403 billion loans while mining and quarrying trailed with N21 billion during the four-year period that also marked downturns in the countryâ€™s economy. It would be recalled that the president of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), Engr. Mansur Ahmed, recently told newsmen in Lagos that the industrial sector of the Nigerian economy was performing below optimum. Engr Ahmed said the sector has the capacity to serve Nigerians but there were still policies that should be put in place. He said Nigerians still have taste for goods imported into the country at the expense of locally manufactured ones. Analysis of the data from NBS showed that in terms of credit to the private sector in general, the total value of credit allocated by banks stood at N15.13trn as at the end of 2018. The oil and gas and manufacturing sectors got credit allocation of N3.55 trillion and N2.23 trillion to record the highest credit allocation in the period under review. Meanwhile, a separate report from the NBS measured the performance of the industrial sector to determine growth. The Mining and Quarrying sector consists of crude petroleum and natural gas, coal mining, metal ore and quarrying and other minerals sub-activities. The sector recorded an annual growth rate of 30.46 per cent in 2018 in nominal terms. Quarrying and other minerals exhibited the highest growth rate of all the sub-activities at 123.82 per cent in the last quarter of 2018. However, crude petroleum and natural gas remains the main contributor to the sector with a share of 96.39 per cent. Further analysis showed that the Mining and Quarrying sector contributed 6.83 per cent to overall GDP in the fourth quarter of 2018, but on an annual basis, the sector accounted for 10.70 per cent of nominal GDP in 2018, compared with 9.22 per cent in 2017. In real terms, the sector contributed 8.74 per cent to total real GDP in 2018. The Manufacturing sector comprises of 13 activities: oil refining; cement; food, beverages and tobacco; textile, apparel, and footwear; wood and wood products; pulp paper and paper products; chemical and pharmaceutical products; non-metallic products, plastic and rubber products; electrical and electronic, basic metal and iron and steel; motor vehicles and assembly; and other manufacturing. The Manufacturing sector in 2018 contributed 9.75 per cent to total nominal GDP, higher than its contribution of 8.83 per cent in 2017. Real GDP growth in the Manufacturing sector rose only slightly from 9.18 per cent in 2017 to 9.20 per cent in 2018. The oil and gas sub sector of the industrial sector of the economy also saw oil refining grew by 33.6 per cent in Q4 2018 from -17.39 per cent in Q3 2018 and -46.24 per cent in Q4 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2018, average daily oil production stood at 1.91 million barrels per day (mbpd). This was lower than the 1.95 mbpd recorded in the same quarter of 2017, and 1.94mbpd in Q3 2018. On an annual basis, real GDP growth for the oil sector stood at 1.14 per cent as against 4.69 per cent recorded in 2017. For 2018, the contribution of the oil sector to aggregate real GDP was 8.60 per cent, slightly lower when compared with 8.67 per cent in 2017.

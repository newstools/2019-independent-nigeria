Frenchman Evan Furness claimed his second professional title of 2019 and third overall, after defeating home favourite, Sandro Ehrat 46 75 64 at M25 Oberentfelden in Switzerland in the pick of the results. One of the key principles behind the newly launched World Tennis Tour (WTT) is to reward a player’s performance with the opportunity to establish themselves at the next level of competition. Furness was the beneficiary of an ITF Reserved place at M25 Hong Kong in the first week of 2019 – and he won the event, defeating Julian Lenz in the final. He therefore gained entry on merit to M25 Oberentfelden last week, thanks his earlier tournament win and other recent results. This latest victory will likely see Furness improve ATP singles rankings above his current career-high of No. 425 and also moves him inside the Top 20 in the ITF World Tennis Singles Rankings. Having already established himself at the M25-level, Furness will be looking to make a similarly successful jump into ATP Challengers using his ITF ranking to access one of seven places reserved for those with ITF rankings. Notable performers through the reserved places last week included Elmar Ejupovic, a quarterfinalist in Oberentfelden, and Jenson Brooksby, the 18-year-old former junior, who was also a quarterfinalist at M15 Claremont in California, United States. Among other highlights on the Tour last week, 27-year-old Karim-Mohamed Maamoun continues to make great strides, after winning a third straight title by defeating Frenchman, Laurent Lokoli 63 61 in Sharm El Sheikh. Maamoun has now reached the final of his last six professional ITF tournaments having also reached three consecutive finals – and winning two of them – last October. The Egyptian Davis Cup player now has 13 singles titles to his name and will move into the ITF singles Top 10 on the back of this performance and, much like Furness, will have greater opportunities to play at ATP Challenger tournaments.

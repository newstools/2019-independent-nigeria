Priyanka Chopra Jonas sits down for an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on Tuesday night (February 5) in New York City. On the show, the 36-year-old actress spoke about why she decided to add “Jonas” to her last name. “I always wanted to add his name to mine because I feel like we’re becoming family, and I’m a little traditional and old school like that,” she told Jimmy Fallon. “But I don’t take away my identity. He gets added to who I am.” “The gravity of it, it’s like a big deal! I didn’t realize it was that much of a big deal until I did it,” she added.

ABAKALIKI – Chief Okorie Onu, kinsman of Dr.  Ogbonnaya Onu, the Minister of Science and Technology, and other opposition leaders in Ohaozara Local Government Area of Ebonyi State at the weekend defected to the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The All Progressives Congress (APC) members announced their defection to PDP during a grand finale of PDP campaign rallies which held at the Uburj Secondary School, Uburu. Explaining the reasons behind their defection to PDP, the defectors said they were joining the PDP to support Governor Umahi who is also their kinsman to win and finish his second term since he has gained the support of other zones of the state. Chief Austin Chukwu of the Labour Party (LP), the brother of Professor Onyebuchi Chukwu, former Minister of Health who lost to Umahi in 2015 and Dr. Nweze Austin, the governorship aspirant of Social Democratic Party (SDP), were among the chieftains that defected to the PDP at the event. Governor Umahi who was visibly elated by the mammoth crowd that graced the occasion urged people of the state to ensure that they arrived at the polling booths on time, cast their votes and remain vigilant. He appealed to them to vote for all PDP candidates. Umahi cautioned them to be mindful of the antics of their opponents who appeared desperate to provoke them to violent reactions.

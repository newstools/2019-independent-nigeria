AWKA – The chairman of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Campaign council in Anambra state Hon. Henry Obaze has said that INEC is yet to apologise to Nigerians for the catastrophic abortion of the Presidential and National Assembly election last Saturday. Obaze, in an interview yesterday said INEC must accept responsibility for causing so much frustration to Nigerians most of who had travelled long distances to perform their civic duty. He said that elections have improved since 2010 and there has been precedence that the chairman of INEC failed to learn from. Obaze said everything including money was at the chairman’s disposal and so he has no reason to fail. He said, for example, non-sensitive materials ought to have been moved to Central Bank of Nigeria custody and if it has problems with delivering sensitive materials to states,  the commission ought to contact the presidency which should authorise the use of military aircraft to do that. According to him,  to rely on Port Harcourt airport to deliver materials for the South East when there are airports in the area and even Asaba smacks of systematic failure. Obaze said INEC’s shift of the election vindicated his earlier stand that INEC was never ready for the election. He said it is difficult to understand why the commission’s offices should be set on fire in broad daylight where there are dozens of security personnel. Nevertheless, Obaze faulted INEC chairman’s stand on the stoppage of the election campaign has stopped, saying that the electoral act says that campaign will stop 24 hours to the election.

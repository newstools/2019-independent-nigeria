D‘Tigers of Nigeria will lead the five African teams that qualified for the 2019 FIBA World Cup in China as number one. The 2015 Afrobasket champion are going to China as Africa’s top team despite 63- 84 points’ loss to Senegal on Sunday, their second in the qualifying series. D’Tigers’ one-guard, Ikenna Iroegbu shot 23 points, dishing out 6 assists and grab 6 rebounds, while Captain, Ike Diogu had 10 points, and 7 rebounds on the night. Despite the defeat which was Nigeria’s second during the last window, the team still finished top in group F as well as in Africa. In his post-match reaction, Nwora said the team would have loved to finish the qualifiers on a high with a win, but it did not go as expected. “I know for sure that it’s not what we expected. We came here to remain undefeated but as God will have it, we did not achieve that goal. We still finished top because of the previous window. We just had problems scoring and we also did not defend well, but I am proud of the guys.” With the absence of some key players coupled with the limited time frame for preparation, Nwora reckoned that it was likely to be a tough journey. “Our scorers were unable to make it. We just had to get the guys that were available late and they gave their best. He congratulated the team for a job well done describing it as mission accomplished after emerging as the winner of the African series. “I am proud that we are still number 1 in Africa and also in our group.” With Nigeria and Senegal tied on 22 points, Nigeria nicked the top spot with superior point’s difference against their arch rival. Although Senegal defeated Nigeria by 21pts on Sunday, Nigeria got the job done in Lagos when they inflicted a 28 point defeat on them. In Group E, Tunisia is first with 22 pts ahead of Angola with 21pts. Other qualifiers are Angola and Cote d’ Ivoire.

Swimming around the development depths, the Max Landis-scripted Deeper has seen several actors and directors climb aboard before bailing out, leaving it adrift. Now Idris Elba is ready to take the dive. The supernatural thriller focuses on a disgraced astronaut, now to be played by Elba, who is on a deep-sea dive exploring a newly discovered trench. He soon finds himself confronted by a sinister and dangerous force… At one point, Bradley Cooper and Gal Gadot were on to star, with White God director Kornel Mundruczo attached to call the shots. Elba joins a film that has Everest and Adrift‘s Baltasar Kormákur behind the camera, with MGM hoping the new duo can actually get the film bubbling along at last. Elba will next show up as villain Brixton in Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs And Shaw, which just put its first trailer out and arrives on 26 July. He’ll also be seen in the film version of Cats, which will be scratching at our cinematic doors looking to be let in on 20 December.

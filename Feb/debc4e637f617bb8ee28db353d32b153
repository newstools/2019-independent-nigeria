Lagos – President Muhammadu Buhari, presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), on Tuesday took an incontrovertible lead as the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) continued collation of results of the presidential election held on Saturday.

Chief Olisa Agbakoba, former President of the Nigeria Bar Association (NBA), said on Tuesday that the voting pattern from last Saturday’s presidential election was driven by parochial, ethnic, and religious colorations. Speaking with Daily Independent, Agbakoba said while Buhari won in his strongholds in Northern Nigeria because of his ethnic and religious leanings, the PDP got more votes in the South-East and South-South because most of the votes from the regions were anti-Buhari votes. He said: “There are three clear things. First, APC is leading and it looks like APC will win. The second thing is that PDP is alleging massive rigging and pointing to the fact that in some states, there were more voters than accredited voters. “I can see that in Yobe State clearly. I have done the calculation and I saw that there were more voters than accredited voters. “The third point is that the election is characterised by parochial and ethnic, religious leanings. Therefore Buhari is holding his base very strongly in Northern Nigeria like Jigawa, Gombe, Bauchi, Borno Katsina, and Kano. “Buhari cleared these places. The thinking was that PDP will make an inroad into that place but clearly, my take is that Nigeria’s electoral process is at an extremely infant stage. “The performance of President Muhammadu Buhari in the last four years does not warrant that he will return like I am seeing. “If it has been based on performance, he may win but not the huge votes he secured in those places. “If you look at the voting pattern in the South-East and South-South, you can see that they are anti-Buhari votes. So, clearly the votes have been driven by ethnic coloration. That was the number one consideration in the voting pattern.” In a related development, pan–Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, said the promise to restructure Nigeria was not the factor responsible for the low votes secured by Atiku Abubakar, the presidential candidate of the PDP. Atiku had promised to restructure Nigeria within six months if he were elected and some analysts had said this affected his chances in the North because northerners were opposed to restructuring. But speaking with our correspondent, Yinka Odumakin, Afenifere’s National Publicity Secretary, said rigging affected the outcome of the election and not the promise to restructure the country. According to him, northerners are not opposed to restructuring except for some few ones among them who are benefiting from the present lopsided structural imbalance. He said: “The North is not opposed to restructuring. It is only a few in the North who are benefiting from what is going on that are opposed to restructuring.” Yobe where we had more voters than accredited voters. It is a big joke.”

Romelu Lukaku, according to report is favoured for a move to Juventus this summer if he is forced out by Manchester United. According to The Sun, the Red Devils may look to offload the Belgium international when the transfer window opens in June. The report indicated that he would hold out for a move to Juventus, where he will get the chance to link up with Cristiano Ronaldo. An insider is quoted by the publication as saying: “Lukaku’s preferred destination would be Juventus if he leaves the club. He is an absolutely massive fan of Ronaldo. He has lost his regular spot but not rocked the boat at all so far. “The feelers are already out in both camps. We’ll have to wait and see but it’s going to be a busy summer.” The 25-year-old has endured an underwhelming second campaign at Old Trafford, scoring just nine times in 33 appearances. Lukaku has struggled to hold down a regular spot through the middle since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer arrived in December, with Marcus Rashford being preferred thanks to his pace in behind. Juventus may be in the market for a new attacking player at the end of the season as Paulo Dybala has been linked with a move away.

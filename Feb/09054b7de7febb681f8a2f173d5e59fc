LAGOS – After closing in the red on Monday, trading on the floor of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) rebounded yesterday as the two major indicators, the All Share Index and Market Capitalisation appreciated by 0.67 per cent each. The rebound, which pushed the All Share Index to 32,406.18 points, was due to buying interests in bellwether stocks like Zenith Bank which also released its full year 2018 financial results on Tuesday, Guaranty Trust Bank and United Bank for Africa. Consequently, market capitalisation increased N80.6 billion to N12.1 trillion while year-to-date (YTD) gain settled at 3.1 per cent. Activity level also strengthened as volume and value traded improved 55.4 per cent and 23.7 per cent to 361.8 million units and N4.2 billion respectively. Transnational Corporation with 120.2 million units, Zenith Bank with 37.3 million units and FBN Holdings with 31.2 million units were the top traded by volume while Dangote Cement at N951.6 million, Zenith Bank at N925.5 million and Guaranty Trust Bank at N778.0 million led the top traded by value. Performance across sectors was bullish as four of five indices trended northwards. The banking index led gainers, up 3.0 per cent following bargain hunting in Zenith Bank (+5.6%) and Guaranty Trust Bank (+3.3%). The oil & gas and consumer goods indices trailed, advancing 0.7 per cent and 0.3 per cent respectively on the back of gains in Oando (+6.3%), Dangote Sugar Refinery (+4.1%) and Unilever Nigeria (+0.5%).

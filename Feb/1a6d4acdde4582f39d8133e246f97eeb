LAGOS – The Nigerian equities market yesterday plunged by 1.89 per cent to end trading for the month of January on a negative note as investors continued to sell their shares ahead of the Presidential election. The All Share Index went down by 588.14 basis points, representing a decrease of 1.89 per cent, to close at 30,557.20 points. Similarly, market capitalisation decreased by N219 billion, closing at N11.395 trillion. The downturn was impacted by losses recorded in medium and large capitalised stocks, amongst which are; Dangote Cement, Nigerian Breweries, Julius Berger, Stanbic IBTC Holdings and Unilever Nigeria. Analysts at Afrinvest Limited said that “following Wednesday’s losses, we expect some bargain hunting in bellwethers to drive performance in subsequent trading sessions.” Analysts at Cordros Capital Limited noted that “the absence of a positive catalyst and political concerns ahead of the 2019 election guide our conservative outlook for equities in the short-to-medium term. However, stable macroeconomic fundamentals remain supportive of recovery in the long term.” Market breadth closed negative with 10 gainers against 32 losers. Sunu Assurance and McNichols recorded the highest price gain of 10 per cent each, to close at 22 kobo and 33 kobo, respectively, while, Learn Africa followed with a gain of 8.73 per cent, to close at N1.37, per share.

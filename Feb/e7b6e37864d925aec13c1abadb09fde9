Residents of Kosovo’s capital, Pristina, gathered to watch a parade of the Kosovo Security Force (KSF) on February 17. The event was organized to mark the 11th anniversary of Kosovo’s declaration of independence — a move rejected by Serbia but recognized by more than 100 countries around the world. In December 2018, Kosovo’s parliament voted to transform the NATO-supervised KSF into a regular army.

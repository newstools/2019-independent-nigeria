Lagos – Hope of Lobi Stars qualifying for the knockout stage of the 2019 CAF Champions League look bleak following the team 0-1 loss to Wydad Casablanca of Morocco in Enugu on Saturday. For a team hoping to reach the knockout stage, losing at home is not an option; even drawing at home is like losing. But here we are Lobi lost with a 20th minute penalty converted by Mohammed Nahiri for Wydad. The visitors would have doubled their lead on 63rd minute but their second penalty miss was the saving grace. Lobi’s goalkeeper, Olufemi Kayode  was beaten, but the upright saved the ball. Saturday’s loss was their second in the group stage having lost their second group game by the same margin to ASEC Mimosa of Cote d’ Ivoire a fortnight ago. Their only win was their 2-1 defeat of Mamelodi Sundowns of South Africa in their group opening game in Enugu. Only on Friday, Sundowns defeated ASEC 3-1 to notch up six points, while Wydad are placed second with six points. Lobi are third with three points while ASEC are placed fourth with three points. For Lobi to reach the knockout stage, they must not lose any game and ensure that they win two of the remaining three games. They will be guest of Wydad on February 12, 2019 before playing Sundowns  away in South Africa on March 09. They will host ASEC in their last group game on March 16, 2019. Meanwhile, the biggest win in the history of the CAF Champions League group stage was recorded on Saturday following TP Mazembe’s mauling of CLUB Africain 8-0.

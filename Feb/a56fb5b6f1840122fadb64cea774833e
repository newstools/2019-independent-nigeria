LAGOS – For the umpteenth time, Air Traffic Controllers (ATC) has lamented the poor state of radio communications between it and pilots flying in the Nigerian airspace. The controllers under the auspices of Nigeria Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) at the weekend said that the poor situation, which had been on over the years needed urgent attention from the government. In a bid to salvage the situation and prevent air accident from happening in the country’s airspace, the controllers called on the Federal Government to come to the aid of the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA) to end the poor situation. Mr. Abayomi Agoro, the President of NATCA made the appeal at the Murtala Muhammed Airport (MMA), Lagos during a chart with aviation journalists. Agoro, explained that the appeal became necessary as NAMA could no longer bear the financial burdens of maintaining some of the navigational aids as a result of high cost of maintenance. He appealed to the government to look inwards by financing the procurement of the equipment from the Bilateral Air Services Agreement (BASA) funds domiciled with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to keep the system running without breakdown. He noted that the management of NAMA under the present leadership had done its best to keep the system running especially with the recent acquisition of radar spare parts.

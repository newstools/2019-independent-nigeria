The union insisted that only the national leadership of the ASUU could suspend the strike meant, which it said was to reposition and revamp public universities in the country, including AAU, Ekpoma. They noted that attempts made by the aniversity administration, including intimidation of members, threat of sack, threat of seizure of salary, campaign of calumny against the leadership of the branch as well as aggressive media propanganda mounted say that lectures had resumed in the University had failed. “Our members are holding on because they believe in their union and perceive all the actions so far taken by the university administration to force them back to work as cheap blackmail and outdated antics,” they stated. The branch, however, accused the university administration of promoting insecurity in the university through sponsorship of thuggery against members of the union to intimidate the union as demonstrated in the disruption of the branch’s congress meeting of January 28, 2010, “in a bid to enthrone tyranny and dictatorship in the administration of the university. The branch reaffirmed its resolve and readiness to resist attempts to install a reign of fear, intimidation, cowardice and loss of academic freedom, which the current University Administration has resolved to foist on the University.

Gernot Rohr, the Super Eagles Head Coach, believes that John Mikel Obi, could propel the team into winning the 2019 Africa Cup of nations holding in Egypt. Nigeria, who missed the last edition of the tournament, have qualified for the Summer edition with a game to spare. Mikel Obi, who last played for the team at the last World Cup in Russia recently moved to the English Championships, a move the coach believes, would help the player spur the Super Eagles winning the nations Cup for the fourth time. Rohr, though, acknowledged that Mikel would have to be fit for him to do well, said that playing regularly at Middlesbrough would help him regain his full fitness. “We are happy to see our captain now playing for a big club. We hope to see him fit and playing regularly. “That’s what we want for all players. They should keep playing well with their teams and keep doing well. “With Mikel playing in a tough league, maybe he can help Nigeria win the 2019 AFCON in Egypt.” Meanwhile, Mikel has rated the championship as tougher than the Premier League. “It’s a tough division, much tougher than the Premier League when you look at it properly,” said Mikel. Mikel is relishing the relentless action in the demanding Championship and can’t wait to reach peak match fitness.

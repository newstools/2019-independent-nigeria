The Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN) has denied a Facebook comment posted by a certain individual with Facebook identity; Jomo Iroha, purporting that its President, Comrade Francis Olabode Johnson, issued a statement over the sale of the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). The Association in a statement signed by the Comrade Lumumba Ighotemu Okugbawa, General Secretary, stated categorically that at no time did PENGASSAN President issue such statement either to the Press or on any Mass Media platform. “We are saddened that the said Jomo Iroha could go as far as originating false news and signing same using the PENGASSAN President’s name. “However, for further clarification on the position and stand of the Association on the status of NNPC, the four refineries and to a large extent, the Nation’s Oil and Gas industry it referred the general public to its Communique of December 13, 2018 which was published in two National Dailies, Punch and Daily Trust of January 24, 2019”. PENGASSAN according to Comrade Okugbawa, is apolitical, neutral and a trade union of repute with the main objectives of protecting jobs and improving the welfare of our members. The statement, however, urged the general public to disregard the mischief intended by the so called Jomo Iroha to score cheap political mileage and acceptance, and implored the public especially the mass media to avail themselves to the open door policy of our Association and the entire leadership and get clarification on any issues.

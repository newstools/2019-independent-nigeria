The Rosicrucian Order AMORC says it will embark on constant meditation, spiritual consciousness as well as awareness creation among its members for peaceful 2019 general elections in Nigeria. Dr Kenneth Idiodi, grand administrator, Supreme Board of AMORC, said this at an interactive session with journalists at the end of its 43rd Eastern Regional Rotational Conclave on Sunday in Calabar. “We are going to be active through meditation, spiritual consciousness and creating of awareness to ensure a peaceful election. We are going to keep out time to do that. “We have some of our members who are contesting in the election; we are going to vote and we are going to encourage our members to exercise their franchise. “We envisage that the election should be free, fair and credible. We want people to approach the election in a more positive way. “For us, our role is spiritual; our focus is that all who participate either as contestants or those who conduct the elections should make it peaceful and violence free, ‘’ Idiodi said. He advised Nigerians to take the elections serious, adding that Nigeria would be better if there was seriousness and the will to overcome challenges. The grand administrator said that the theme of this year’s conclave “Spirituality for Justice’’ was borne out of the need for value orientation by the leaders and the led in Nigeria. According to him, Nigeria had continued to be plagued by various social problems including poverty, terrorism, superstition, discrimination criminality and ill-health due to lack of social justice. “When society denies people of their fair share of goods and services while others get more than they deserve, an imbalance is created in its internal structure. “The fundamental balance of society is maintained by justice,” he said.

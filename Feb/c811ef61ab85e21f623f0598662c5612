LAGOS – Bharti Airtel is giving serious consideration to raise at least $3 billion from its planned asset sales in the next 12 months, which along with an imminent mobile tariff recovery in India, will ease pressure on its leverage and support its stable (BBB-/stable) outlook, global ratings agency, Fitch said. According to Fitch report, “Bharti Airtel’s planned asset sales, including a potential initial public offer (IPO) of its African entity and sale of its stake in the (future) Indus-Bharti Infratel tower company, will relieve pressure on its funds flow from operations (FFO)-adjusted net leverage, which is nearing the 2.5x threshold, above, which we will consider negative rating action,” Fitch said in a media statement on Monday. The global rating agency also expects the recent introduction of minimum recharge plans by incumbents, higher data usage and easing competition from Reliance Jio Infocomm will “drive an increase in average industry tariff by at least 10 per cent to $1.6 in calendar 2019. Fitch estimates Bharti Airtel’s revenue and Ebitda for FY20 to rebound as data usage and tariffs rise. Bharti Airtel shares were down nearly 2 per cent in afternoon trade on BSE at Rs 305.20 probably due to the report. The Sunil Mittal-led telco had reported a consolidated Rs 86 crore net profit in the December quarter, which was 72 per cent lower from a year ago, but the company’s revenue decline was arrested by the initial effects of the telco’s minimum recharge plans, which pushed up its India mobile ARPU 4.1 per cent on-quarter to Rs104. Bharti Airtel, which faces severe pressure on revenue and profitability in India owing to brutal competition, is trying to build a war chest to fund network expansion and take on Jio. It has been selling stakes in tower arm Bharti Infratel, and plans to sell 32 per cent more in that company to unlock funds to bolster its countrywide 4G networks to counter Jio.

LAGOS – Duru Stephen Arinze, a former Rangers player, has threatened to report the Flying Antelopes to the League Management Company (LMC) and the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) over the club’s alleged refusal to settle his entitlements running into millions of naira. Arinze played for the club between February and October, 2015 and DAILY INDEPENDENT gathered that between the periods under consideration, the player’s monetary entitlements from the club stood at N2, 940,000. The breakdown of what the club are owing the player are as follows: payment shortfall of N720,000, which is N180,000 for four months covering the months of July, August, September and October. There is another sum of N1, 520,000 and a further loan consideration fee of N700,000, totaling N2,940,000. Our correspondent gathered that the player is threatening to drag Rangers to the regulatory bodies to make sure that his monies are paid timely. According to Article 9.45, subsection 1 of NPFL framework, “Clubs are required to comply with their financial obligations towards players, employees and other clubs as per the terms stipulated in the contracts signed with their professional players, employees in the transfer agreements. It is obvious that if the allegation is true, Rangers breached article 9.45 of the NPFL framework of rules applicable to overdue payables. Efforts to confirm the allegation from Rangers failed as we could not reach any management staff of the club. But DAILY INDPEPENENT gathered that players of Rangers are still being owed sums of money even as they are campaigning on the continent and doing well.

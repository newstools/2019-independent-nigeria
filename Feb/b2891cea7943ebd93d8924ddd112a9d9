DUTSE – Barrister Kaloma Mustapha, a Social Democratic Party (SDP) candidate vying for House of Representatives seat to represent Garki/Babura Federal Constituency, has stated that his victory at the poll was certain because of his three distinct credentials. The credentials are public and human expertise, exposure in both private and public sector being a professional lawyer by profession who excel in different human engagements, among other vast qualities. In a chat with our correspondent on his mission, he said his chances of winning in the rescheduled presidential and National Assembly polls next Saturday was bright. He said his aspiration was informed by his concern for his community’s plights in terms of development especially in the denial of social amenities for the down-trodden masses whom were deprived of the dividends of democracy due to poor representation of their by the elected representatives. Kaloma who rated APC-led government of Governor Muhammad Badaru Abubakar as low in terms of rural development and transformation, said most of its pronounced achievements were shylock and a mirage. He said it was a pity to note that APC-led administration of Governor Badaru was nothing short of embarrassment, and destruction of the state public institutions. On his vision for the people, he said that if he wins at polls he would focus on empowering the youths with  skills and expertise to be self-reliant in job creation, women development, arrest of poverty, among other good tidings based on the SDP cardinal objectives in the promotion of human dignity, and good governance.

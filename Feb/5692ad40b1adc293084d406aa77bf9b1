Lagos – Ahead of the February 16 presidential election, President Muhammadu Buhari will today meet with past military governors, especially those who served under the regime of former dictator, the late General Sani Abacha. According to Daily Independent findings, the meeting is being convened by Brig. Gen. Buba Marwa (rtd), former military governor of Borno and Lagos states who is the Chairman of the Presidential Advisory Committee on Elimination of Drug Abuse (PACEDA). A senior presidential aide confirmed the development to our correspondent on Sunday but said he had no details of what the meeting entails. “Yes, it is true. The president is meeting with past military administrators and governors. It is, however, not true that they are basically those who served under Abacha. I am not aware of the details of the meeting,” he said. Another aide said, given the support given by Marwa to President Buhari’s re-election so far, he may have rallied his colleagues to endorse the president’s quest for a second term. According to him, “General Marwa is one of the staunch supporters of President Muhammadu Buhari. So, I won’t be surprised if he has rallied his colleagues together and they have decided to publicly endorse the president’s re-election.” Efforts to reach Marwa proved abortive as several calls and text messages sent to his mobile phone were not answered.

IBADAN – Olamiju Alao-Akala, son of former governor of Oyo State and gubernatorial candidate of Action Democratic Party (ADP), Otunba Adebayo Alao-Akala, has been suspended as the Executive Chairman of Ogbomoso North Local Government Area. The Alao-Akala’s son, who recently defected from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to ADP to support his father’s governorship ambition, was also suspended by the ruling party in the state. It would be recalled that the former governor withdrew from the contest to get Oyo gubernatorial ticket few days to the primaries and later secured the ADP’s ticket to contest the 2019 election. Also, Olamiju, who contested and won the Chairmanship seat of Ogbomoso North Local Government Area on the platform of APC in May 12, 2018 council election in the state, dumped the ruling party last week to join his father in the new party. However, the crisis took another dimension as four councillors in a letter dated February 15, 2019 suspended Alao-Akala’s son as the council boss. The four councilors, who signed the letter obtained by journalists in Ibadan on Tuesday, included Hon. Adebowale Oladunmoni (Deputy Leader), Hon. Zakariyau Ayinde Kabiru, Hon. Adisa Raheem Kingsley and Hon. Busari Lamidi Adesina. The four councillors in the letter, a copy which were sent to the office of the Commissioner for Local Government Affairs, Mr. Bimbo Kolade, said, “Take notice that we the undersigned councillors in Ogbomoso Local Government Area hereby passed a resolution suspending you from the office as the executive chairman of Ogbomoso North Local Government for your gross misconduct Dr. Abdulazeez Olatunde, Oyo APC Publicity Secretary, who confirmed Olamiju’s suspension to newsmen, said the party took the right decision by suspending Alao-Akala because he dumped the APC to join ADP.

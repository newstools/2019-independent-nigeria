YENAGOA – King Bubaraye Dakolo, a first class traditional ruler in Bayelsa State, said on Friday that preparations for the forthcoming general elections seemed like Nigeria was going into a civil war, insisting that it ought not to be so. Dakolo, who is the monarch of Ekpetiama Kingdom in Yenagoa Local Government Area, stated this during a one-day stakeholders’ forum on “Niger Delta Watch 2019”, organised by the Stakeholders Democracy Network (SDN) in Yenagoa. According to him, electoral violence and vote buying and selling had remained a menace in Nigeria, stressing that a huge proportion of eligible voters were positioning themselves to be bought over by politicians at the polls. While noting that there would be no vote buyer if there were no vote seller, Dakolo stated: “From my own view, the preparation for the election in this country is like we are preparing for another civil war. That is not what we want. “So, the solution lies largely on the electorate who have the power to decide whether they want to sell their votes or they want their votes to create the positive change we need.” Presenting a research report titled “Current Political and Security Trends in Bayelsa State”, Robinson Kuroghobogha, the chairman of Bayelsa Non-Governmental Organisations (BANGOF), predicted that there would be an alarming increase in vote buying and vote selling activities in the state during the elections. Kuroghobogha, who was represented by Keme Opia, secretary of the coalition, warned that if effective monitoring and response mechanisms were not put in place, the state would witness the highest level of electoral fraud perpetuated through vote buying and vote selling.

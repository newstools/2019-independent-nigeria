Lagos – Kenneth Omeruo, Super Eagles star, has ruled himself out of another loan deal and his targeting a permanent contract at the end of the season. Omeruo, who is on loan from Chelsea of England to Leganes of Spain, has been in tremendous form with Leganes, such that he has started and completed five straight matches with his team in La Liga. The stopper’s amazing form has left many observers wondering why he keeps being loaned by Chelsea, who are yet to give him a single competitive match in their senior squad since he arrived from Standard Liege of Belgium in 2012. “It has to be the last time I will be going out on loan. We have not discussed anything yet. They have not shown any interest. “Fingers crossed. We are looking at other options as well. We will see at the end of the season what happens. “Honestly, I want to stay at Leganes. My game has really improved because after each game. “I have some private time with the manager and he explains a lot of things to me. “Some mistakes, some corrections about positioning and these have really helped my football. I am happy to be working under him” said Omeruo on his ability to seal a permanent deal with Leganes of Spain. Chelsea have loaned Omeruo to ADO Den Haag of Holland, twice to Middlesbrough of England, twice to Kasimpasa of Turkey and once to their Lig rivals, Konyanspor. However, based on his status as super-regular at Leganes, Omeruo is seeking a permanent stay with the Liga club, and says he will not take another loan deal from Chelsea. Omeruo is also happy with the relationship he has been able to hit off with Leganes’ gaffer, Mauricio Pellegrino, who he says keeps giving him useful tips on how to stay on top of his game. With all conditions seemingly falling into pleasant places for him and everything working together for good at Leganes, the dark-skinned former Sunshine Stars of Akure stopper is thinking of staying put.

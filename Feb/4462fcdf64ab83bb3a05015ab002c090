Lagos – The Nigerian Football Federation (NFF) has announced the death of Chukwuma Agbo, the assistant coach of Super Sand Eagles, otherwise called Beach Soccer Eagles. The football house announced the death through its tweeter handle, describing the death as “another painful loss.” The NFF tweeted: “Yet another painful loss! We are sad to hear of the passing of Assistant Coach of our Beach Soccer National team, the Super Sand Eagles, Chukwuma Agbo. Our prayers are with his family at this time. May his soul rest in peace.” Agbo has coached both Rangers of Enugu and Delta Force FC of Asaba.

Before resigning his post at Delta Force last month, Agbo led the club to the Nigeria National League, NNL Super 8 where they ended fourth in Group B.

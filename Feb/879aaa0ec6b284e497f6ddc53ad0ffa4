Vice Chancellor, of the university Professor Yakubu Muktar, called for the dissemination of research findings and disclosed that Yobe State was among the most affected by the Boko Haram insurgency, pointing out that bad governance has contributed to youth restiveness, “bad governance has been one of the reasons for the emergence of this problem, I could recall that for years before the eruption of Boko Haram, my late mentor, Professor, Nur Alkali, was concerned about the youth gathering in Maiduguri, people from other states of the federation were dumped in Maiduguri in the name of Almajiri,” he said.

Yenagoa – A coalition of Civil Society Organisations (CSOs), on Wednesday, expressed dismay over the non-implementation of the report on electoral violence in Bayelsa State in the 2015 general elections and the state governorship election. The CSOs, comprising Campaign for Democracy, Coalition Against Electoral Violence and the Save Bayelsa/ Save Niger Delta Group, said it was disturbing that three years after the submission of the report to relevant authorities, no action had been taken. The CSOs stated this in a joint press statement by their leaders including Bayo Obatughase, Deputy National President of CD; Femi Lawson and Ologun of the Coalition Against Electoral Violence and Isaac Atani of the Save Bayelsa/Save Niger Delta Group. They wondered why the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the Federal Government, Bayelsa State Government, security agencies and even the international community, three years after, had not deemed it necessary to act on the report which detailed the violence and atrocities that happened during the elections. They raised the alarm that arms were being stockpiled in the Niger Delta ahead of the 2019 polls and that it was worrisome that report on the 2015 electoral violence had not been given the desired attention. They further recalled that several deaths were recorded in Bayelsa during the 2015 general elections with property worth millions of Naira destroyed, stressing that the report captured visual and audio evidences. According to the coalition, the report, in particular, allegedly captured the ignoble roles played by some notable politicians, including the current Minister of State for Agriculture and Rural Development, Heineken Lokpobiri, an indigene of Ekeremor Local Government Area of Bayelsa. They said they were shocked that President Muhammadu Buhari, after assumption of office in May 2015, appointed Lokpobiri as minister, and had carried on as if nothing happened.

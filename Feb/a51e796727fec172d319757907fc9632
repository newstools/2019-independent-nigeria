The Enugu Electricity Distribution Company (EEDC) has commenced massive disconnection of all properties erected in violation of power line Right of Way (ROW) in the entire South East. Mr Emeka Ezeh, EEDCâ€™s Head of Communications, made this known in a statement issued in Enugu on Wednesday. The power line Right-of-Way (or ROW) is the mapped out corridor for distribution and transmission power lines, which is usually meant for electricity high voltage line movement or passage. It is a precautionary safety measure accompanied by mandatory clearance levels, to be observed and adhered to by members of the public, for the safety of all. Ezeh said the move was in compliance with the directive issued by Nigerian Electricity Management Services Agency to distribution companies. He said the agency had instructed DISCOs to disconnect power supply to all structures, buildings and premises that were in violation of the power line ROW. He said that EEDC was in full liaison with relevant government agencies to ensure this directive was carried out effectively. Ezeh said the EEDC in 2018 issued a release advising its customers and the general public against putting up structures and carrying out business activities within power line ROW. The EEDC spokesman said the distribution company equally enumerated the various power lines and their respective clearance levels.

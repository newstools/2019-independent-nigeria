KADUNA – Less than two weeks to the general elections, gubernatorial candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in Kaduna State, Polycarp Gankon, has denied the rumour making round in the state that he has collected money to mortgage his candidature. Polycarp, while speaking with journalists at the NUJ Secretariat, said he was never compromised at any time. The APGA candidate, who also contested in 2015 against former governor Ramalan Yero and Governor Nasir el-Rufai, disclosed that he took the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to court in 2015 for what he believed was an injustice to him, alleging that he was robbed of electoral victory in the 2015 gubernatorial election in the state largely because of the activities of INEC. According to him; “I had to drag the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to court, because of the irregularities we later discovered in the whole exercise in the state. Even when I challenged the result of the election at the tribunal, INEC brought judgment instead of justice. Polycarp called on INEC not to take sides in the upcoming elections as the destiny of Nigerians lies on their shoulders.

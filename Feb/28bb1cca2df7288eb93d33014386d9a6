UYO – The recently inaugurated Legal Defence Centre in Akwa Ibom State has dragged the Inspector General of Police, Akwa Ibom State Police Commissioner and All Progressives Alliance (APC) to court over an alleged plot by the opposition to arrest and detain the Speaker, Akwa Ibom State House of Assembly, Onofiok Luke, and other prominent members of the PDP. In the application with the suit no: HU/FHR18/30, filed January 31, 2019, the centre also identified others marked for arrest and detention till the elections were over to include; the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) state chairman, Mr Paul Ekpo, and 20 others, including some House of Assembly members and other prominent members of the PDP in the state. DAILY INDEPENDNT reports that having been vocal on campaign grounds during the ongoing electioneering by the governor’s campaign organization, Luke had recently alerted members of the public about threats to his life by his former boss, Godswill Akpabio. It would be recalled that Luke during the campaigns had disclosed how the previous government in the state had administered fetish oaths on those nominated for appointments and how the then first lady administering salt on Deuteronomy for would be appointees to extract loyalty. Chairman of the centre Andem Ndem, who disclosed the plot to arrest Luke and others in Uyo on Monday, said the cells of the state police headquarters, Ikot Akpan Abia were filled with PDP members picked up for minor offences such as speaking against the APC in beer parlours. Further justifying the centre’s reason for approaching the court, Andem said there was a standing order in police divisions across the state to direct any PDP member picked in connection with the forthcoming elections to be sent to the police headquarters where such a person would be detained without a case file or trial till the elections were over. He cited the case of a 13-year-old boy from Esit Eket, who was picked up by the police for tearing a poster belonging to one of the candidates of the APC. The boy who was unconditionally discharged by the judge, having been branded a cultist, was according to Andem, charged to court on the insistence of the Legal Defence Centre, which rose to his illegal detention.

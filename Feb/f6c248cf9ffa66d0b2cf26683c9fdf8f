After a miserable 0-1 home loss to Sunshine Stars of Akure on Sunday, Wikki Tourists will face a difficult match when they play Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries (MFM) at the Agege Stadium on Sunday. MFM are third in Group A with six points from four matches, while their guests are fourth on the log with the same points after four matches. How difficult the match will be to Wikki Tourists will be gauged considering how impregnable the Olukoya Boys have been at their home since they gained promotion to the topflight a couple of seasons ago. For instance, the last time MFM lost at home was last season when Abia Warriors visited Lagos and piped them 1-0 through a 54th minute Ndifreke Effiong goal. But that is not the case. Before that infamous defeat in the hands of Ochendo Babes, MFM last lost a home game on September 1, 2016 in a match against Rangers. Tope Olusesi rose highest to give the Flying Antelopes the most sought after goal in the 75th minute to condemn MFM to a home loss that year. Besides, all the three times Wikki had visited Lagos for a match against MFM ended in defeats.Â  In 2016, MFM defeated Wikki 1-0 in Lagos. In 2017, their meeting at the same venue ended 2-1 in favour of the hosts, while it was MFM who edged Wikki 1-0 last year when they met in Lagos.

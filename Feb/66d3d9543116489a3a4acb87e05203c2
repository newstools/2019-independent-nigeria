Akure – Four men of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Ondo State Command, were on Sunday killed at Ifon in Ose Local Government Area of Ondo State. The victims are Abduljalad Mohammed, Wellinton Emmanuel, Magaji Aliu, and Mohammed lliyasu. Sources said five officers of the agency, including the deceased, were on patrol duty when two persons on a motorcycle opened fire on them. It was learnt that one of the officers escaped into the bush unhurt while four of his colleagues lost their lives. The hoodlums reportedly set ablaze the agency’s van used for patrol in the area and carted away rifles and personal belongings of their victims. Haruna Gagara, the NDLEA State Commander, confirmed the killings and vowed that the incident would not negatively affect the fight against narcotics dealers in the state. “Five of my officers were on patrol duty along Ifon road. Two persons on motorcycle with AK-47 riffles in a sack opened fire on the officers, killing four and one escaped unhurt. “They set the patrol van ablaze before they left. This type of incident has not happened before. But we have had cases of mob attack. This is the first time they came and attacked our men for no reason. “It is an unprovoked attack. The people we are waging war against are the prime suspects. I am sure that God will expose them and we will get them. “But I am promising you that this will not deter us. Rather, this will ginger us to do more. I assure you that with other security agencies in the state, the war will surely be won,” Gagara said. Femi Joseph, the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) in the state, also confirmed the incident and said everything would be done to apprehend and prosecute the culprits.

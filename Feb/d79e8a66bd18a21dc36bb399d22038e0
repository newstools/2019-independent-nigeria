Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta on Wednesday ordered striking nurses across the country to resume work on Friday or face disciplinary action.
Kenyatta said this when he held a crisis meeting with the leadership of the Ministry of Health and the Council of Governors in Nairobi.
The president directed the police to take stern actions against any nurse, who may intimidate or harass those intending to go to work.
“Accordingly, any nurse, who fails to report to work as directed above will be dismissed by the county governments and the ministry of health,” he said in a televised address to the nation.
“We cannot allow unlawful industrial actions to derail us from our focus of taking Kenya forward,” said Kenyatta.
The nurses’ strike entered its second week on Monday.
It has affected critical services at public hospitals where the bulk of Kenya’s low-income earners seek treatment for a range of infectious and non-communicable diseases.
Seth Panyako, Secretary-General, Kenya National Union of Nurses, said his members would not relent in their push for higher salaries and perks in line with an agreement signed with the employers.
But Kenyatta termed the strike illegal since it violates an order by the Employment and Labour Relations court that suspended the industrial action.
“One of the most important principles upon which our republic is established is the rule of law — no one is above the law.
“Obeying court orders is not optional but a requirement to all of us,” Kenyatta said.

Lagos – It was a big drama at Agege Stadium in Lagos as Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries (MFM) FC came from two goals down to beat visiting Niger Tornadoes 3-2 in one of the week eight Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) matches. Peter Abashiya put Tornadoes in front barely two minutes into the match and MFM consequently piled pressure on the visitors. But it was the visitors that doubled their lead and silenced the crowd at the stadium when Jonathan Osondu scored five minutes later. In the seventeenth minute, Osondu came close to making it three for Tornadoes but his attempt went off target. But MFM responded with a huge pressure, which paid off in the 45th minute when Abisoye Olawale pulled one back. In the 52nd minute, Michael Ohanu levelled up for MFM, scoring with power and precision. Three minutes into the additional time, Chuks Kenedinum broke the hearts of Tornadoes with a last gasp effort to earn the whole three points for the Odukoya Boys. In the other matches, Kwara United defeated Wikki Tourists 1-0 in Ilorin even as Enyimba left it late to pip Remo Stars 1-0 in Aba. In Kano, Kano Pillars beat Yobe Stars 3-1 while El-Kanemi Warriors Piped Abia Warriors 1-0 in Maiduguri, even as Heartland and FC IfeanyiUbah shared the spoil with a 1-1 draw in Okigwe, Imo State.

Abuja – The Senate on Monday announced the discontinuation of its case filed at the Supreme Court on the suspension of Justice Walter Nkanu Onnoghen by President Muhammadu Buhari. The Senate explained that it ordered the discontinuation because of the intervention of the National Judicial Council (NJC) on the issue. Recall that the Senate had gone to court seeking the Supreme Court’s interpretation of the law on the suspension. The decision to go to court followed its suspension of the emergency session it earlier called. The President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki, in a statement by his Special Adviser, Yusuph Olaniyonu, announced that it had decided to give the NJC’s intervention a chance. He said: “The Senate has, therefore, decided to discontinue the case it filed in the Supreme Court. It should be noted that the case has been slated for hearing tomorrow. “This decision also affirms the confidence of the Senate in the ability of the NJC to successfully and creditably resolve the issues.”

Lagos – Emmanuel Amuneke, the former Super Eagles winger and current coach of Simba of Tanzania, has warned the Nigerian U20 National Team against playing individual football, urging the players to play as a team in Wednesday’s semifinal of the ongoing Africa U20 Cup of Nation ongoing in Niger Republic. Amuneke, who was cornered by journalists in Niger Republic where he is serving as a member of CAF’s Technical Study Group, noted that if the Flying Eagles would play as a team and forget about individual play, they would come out victorious. “Our players have to do more of team work. The semifinal match against Mali would be explosive and would be an interesting one. But if we play as a team rather than players doing their individual thing, we would come out on top,” he said. Mutiu Adepoju, former Nigerian international, while speaking to DAILY INDEPENDENT on Nigeria’s chances against Mali, said the Flying Eagles would surely come out victorious provided they play as a team and cover for one another’s lapses. “It is as simple as that; if they can play for one another and will not be individualistic, I can tell you that they have a big chance against Mali. They should not allow their qualification for the World Cup blight the task of beating Mali and marching ahead,” he said.

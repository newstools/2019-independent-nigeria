The American ambassador to Nigeria, Stuart Symington, has dismissed claims by the Buhari 2019 Presidential Campaign Council that his country was subtly supporting the opposition as the general elections approach. The director, strategic communications of the team, Festus Keyamo, on Monday, lampooned Mr Symington and other Western diplomats, saying their recent statements on the elections showed they were tactically supporting the opposition, seeking to unseat President Muhammadu Buhari. Mr Keyamo specifically accused Mr Symington of interfering in the 2019 electoral processes. “The impression he (Mr Symington) creates by constantly harping on suspected government interference with the electoral process is that President Buhari cannot win without tipping the results. He seems to be saying that only a PDP victory will be evidence of a fair election,” an infuriated Mr Keyamo said. “Instead of encouraging free and fair elections, these judgmental statements and threats only cast an unnecessary pall over the elections and the nation,” he added. Western nations have in the past few weeks called on relevant stakeholders in the Nigerian polity to work together to ensure free and credible polls. The U.S. Embassy, via its website on Tuesday, said the US government was not taking sides in Nigeria’s electoral process. The statement said the U.S. government supports the work of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). It urged Nigerian citizens to be wary of fake news and rumours that are “operating in overdrive”. It said the 2019 general election “is as important to foreign diplomats as much as it is important to Nigerians.” The U.S. government also called on every Nigerian and the security forces to peacefully support the democratic process “in accordance with the Nigerian law”.

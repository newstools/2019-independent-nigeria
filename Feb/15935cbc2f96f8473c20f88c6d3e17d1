SEGUN OLANIYAN KATSINA – No less than N8.3 billion has been expended by the Federal Government for rehabilitation of the 104- kilometre Funtua Road in Katsina State to Gusau Capital of Zamfara State. The project which was awarded in 2009 had problems of completion owing to non-release of funds by the previous government. Engr. F. B. Esan, the Director of Works in the North West Zone under Federal Ministry of Works, disclosed this while inspecting the Funtua-Gusau completed road project on Sunday in Funtua. “The present APC Administration had supported the completion of the road project by the prompt release of funds to the company handling the rehabilitation exercise,” he said. He, however, maintained that the company would continue to maintain the rehabilitated road for the next one year before its transfer to the Federal Road Maintenance Agency (FERMA). Tunde Balogun, the Katsina State controller of works earlier explained that the aim of the rehabilitation of the road was to improve the living standard of the common man in the area. Balogun called on road users not to vandalise the road through the cutting to install water pipes and dumping of refuse in the drainages to enable it serve its purpose.

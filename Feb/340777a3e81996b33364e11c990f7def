Two more cases of swine flu have been confirmed in the country. This time in Bloemfontein according to Sowetanlive.co.za reports. News24 reports that two people are being treated for the much feared H1N1 virus at Medi Clinic in Bloemfontein. Two pupils were treated for the virus in June at the Durbanville school in Cape Town where the Department of Education said that people should not panic as it is now “part of our seasonal strain and it was part of it since 2012″. The spokesperson at the Bloemfontein Medic Clinc also shares the same sentiments. “There is no reason for panic. It is not a light ailment, but it is not the terror disease that people think it is. There are already much worse flu strains going around,” Rynette Oosthuizen said. “We treat it as a seasonal flu and this season’s flu injection does vaccinate against H1N1.” Despite South African medicine officials saying people should not worry, the United States has put aside over R4billion towards fighting swine flu.

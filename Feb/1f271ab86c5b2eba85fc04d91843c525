Charles Oputa, alias Charly Boy, maverick activist, has said that he will lead a peaceful protest to the headquarters of Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) if the agency shifts the Presidential and National Assembly elections on Saturday. Charly Boy said this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Tuesday in Abuja. Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, the INEC Chairman, early on Saturday, February 16, announced the postponement of the  polls to February 23 because of “logistics and operational problems”. The commission also shifted the state Governorship and legislative elections as well as Council polls in the Federal Capital Territory from March 2 to March 9. However, reactions had continued to trail the action of the electoral umpire with many Nigerians, especially political players, calling for the resignation of the chairman. Charly Boy, the Convener of #Ourmumudondo Movement, however, stressed that he saw the inability of Nigeria to hold the polls on the scheduled date as ‘an act of God’. He however warned that any further shift of the elections, especially the presidential poll, would be protested by his group. “I want to believe that what happened on Saturday was some kind of divine intervention, no matter how much things have become so politicised in our environment. “However, if there is another postponement, we will go to INEC office to tell us what is happening and whether they are truly independent or not.” Charly Boy urged Nigerians, especially the youth, to come out and vote for leaders of their choice in all the elections. The  68 -year-old activist, who described himself as the ‘President of all frustrated Nigerians’, however, expressed disappointment that the youth failed to rally support for  young candidates to realise the “Not Too Young To Run” dream.

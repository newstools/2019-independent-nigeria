LAGOS – Alloy Agu, Super Eagles goalkeepers’ trainer, has expressed optimism that the team will have a good outing at the forthcoming Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Egypt with adequate preparations. In a sports radio programme monitored in Lagos on Tuesday, the team’s former goalkeeper said that the players were determined to make Nigerians proud by winning the trophy. “We know what is ahead of us and what is expected of us. We have a desire to do well and win the Nations Cup in Egypt. “All we need to do as technical crew is prepare very well for the competition and with determination from the players to excel, we are good to win the trophy. “Be that as it may, I want to assure you that we will prepare very well, and I am also sure that the players are determined to excel. So, we can win the Nations Cup in Egypt,” he said. Agu, who was part of the 1994 AFCON winning team in Tunisia and Nigeria’s debut World Cup outing at USA ’94, further disclosed that all the players and coaches were focused on the task ahead. He reckoned that the desire to do well at Egypt 2019 was the foundation of Nigeria’s chances of winning a fourth continental title, and stressed that the team would go all the way with good preparation as well as support and encouragements from football loving Nigerians once they can prepare properly. Though, already qualified for the Nations Cup, the Super Eagles will play Seychelles on March 22 in the last qualifier.

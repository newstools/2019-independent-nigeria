JOS – Governor Simon Lalong re-election campaign council has condemned the failure of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate in Plateau state, Jeremiah T Useni, to turn up for the second edition of the state gubernatorial debate held in Jos, the Plateau State capital. Spokesman of the Lalong Campaign Council, Jonathan Ishaku, in a statement issued to newsmen on Tuesday in Jos, said they regretted the inability of Useni of the Peoples Democratic Party to honor the gubernatorial debate between him and Governor Lalong, which also included four other candidates of other political parties in the state. According to him, the gubernatorial debate was organised by a group, Plateau Professionals, to enable governorship candidates of the selected political parties to showcase their campaign promises and what they intended to do for the people of the state they wanted to govern if any of them wins the March 2 governorship election in the state. Ishaku argued that the excuse given by Useni Media Council to the people of Plateau was not convincing enough as it seems the PDP governorship candidate was not ready for the job he is aspiring for on the Plateau. According to him, Useni could not claim to be busier than Governor Lalong that honoured the invitation and participated actively in the debate which he featured prominently alongside other four candidates of other political parties in the state. Ishaku added that the people of his state had expected all their top political gladiators wishing to run for March 2 governorship election on the Plateau to show up at the much publicised debate to give account of themselves. He added that the hope of the ruling government in the state and Lalong Campaign Council was for the main opposition party on the Plateau to re-organised itself quickly so that they join the governorship race.

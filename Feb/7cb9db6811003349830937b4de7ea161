The government of Tanzania on Friday ruled out lifting its blanket ban on exports of live wild animals, Ministry for Natural Resources and Tourism, told the National Assembly. “We are working to review the Wildlife Conservation Act 2009 to be able to impose total ban on the export of wild animals. “The ban which has been in place for three years will not be lifted,’’ Constantine Kanyasu, the Deputy Minister for Natural Resources and Tourism, told the House in the capital Dodoma. The minister said the government had in 2016 imposed the ban on export of live wild animals following exporters’ violation of the Wildlife Conservation Act No. 5 of 2009.

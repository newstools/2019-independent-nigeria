Benin – Dambaba Usman, an Assistant Inspector General of Police (AIG) in charge of zone 5, Benin City, has called on officers and men of the Nigeria Police Force in the zone to strive to be part of the nation’s democratic history, even as he charged them to avoid acts capable of undermining the nation’s peaceful electoral process. The AIG gave the advice at a capacity building training programme on democratic policing and elections security management for officers and men of Nigeria Police Force, organised by Hi-Tech security services and training Ltd in collaboration with Nigeria Police Force held in Benin. “Do what is right so that you will be counted in the right part of history and not on the bad part of history because the election will come and go but the country will still remain. Bayelsa State will remain, Delta State will remain and Edo State will still remain. “What is happening now is briefing and after the election there will be debriefing. There will be assessment and whatever we have done during that election will be brought to the fore and there will be appellation, praises, condemnation, all these will be brought out,” he said. The AIG, represented by the Edo State Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosun, said the training has become paramount because of the responsibility vested on them as law enforcement agency to assist the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to bring about a peaceful election in the country. Dambaba noted that it would be out of place if they are ignorant of how election is to be conducted in a democratic dispensation. “The Police should be well equipped because there are two leading agencies that are conducting the elections, the police and the INEC,” he said.

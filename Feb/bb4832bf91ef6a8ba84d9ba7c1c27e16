The big cat skulked through the Korum Mall basement before opening hours early morning Wednesday in Thane, outside Mumbai, the Hindustan Times and other media reported. Surveillance video showed the leopard pacing through the empty mall before shuffling through the parking lot about 5:30 a.m., the paper said. Its movement toward a residential area triggered a capture mission, and forest officials trapped and tranquilized the animal in the basement of a nearby hotel. Officials speculated that the leopard absconded from Sanjay Gandhi National Park, a serene nature preserve dotted with lakes and basalt cave complexes in the heart of Mumbaiâ€™s gargantuan sprawl. The mall is less than two miles from the eastern edge of the park, which notes a high density of leopards.The eradication of natural habitats and urban expansion put humans and wild animals on a collision course, sometimes with deadly consequences for both, in India and across the world. Days ago, a leopard sowed chaos in the northern Indian state of Punjab. The cat injured four people in an hours-long ordeal before it was subdued in a home. Last year, Indian authorities launched a military-style operation to capture a tigress believed to have killed at least 13 people. It was cornered and killed in November, prompting joy from villagers but outcries from conservationists who said the mother was defending her cubs from increasing human encroachment. Wild animal encounters in population centers are common in the United States. A man killed a mountain lion with his bare hands after it attacked him while he was trail running this month in Colorado, where officials said human population growth has meant more interactions with wild animals.

Top runners for the 2019 Access Bank Lagos City Marathon are now in town and raring to go. While some are making a return to compete in the IAAF Bronze Label race, others will be making their debuts, but nonetheless looking forward to snapping up the 50,000 USD 1st prize up for grabs at Saturday’s race.

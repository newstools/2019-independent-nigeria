AWKA – The All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) has lifted the suspension of three key functionaries of the Anambra State House of Assembly. The hitherto suspended officers of the Assembly are the Majority Leader, Harford Oseke, Victor Okoye and the leader of the group of legislators that attempted to topple the leadership of the House two months ago, Ikem Uzoezie. They were allegedly involved in the purported impeachment of the speaker, Rita Maduagwu. Chairman of the party in the state, Norbert Obi, while briefing the press on Wednesday, said the lawmakers had shown enough remorse to be pardoned after the failed impeachment saga . According to Obi, the indefinite suspension clamped on them was lifted after the party had carefully monitored them since then.

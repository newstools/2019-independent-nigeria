LAGOS – The Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria(IPMAN) is currently embroiled in controversy over planned N5 reduction in the price of fuel billed to commence in its stations to encourage Nigerians to participate in the rescheduled Presidential and National Assembly elections on Saturday At a press conference in Abuja yesterday, the factional President of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), Mr Sanusi Fari implored members to disregard the national president’s directive to reduce petroleum pump price from N145 to N140. He urged the members to continue to render their services to the public in view of the one week postponement of the elections, adding that his members should not sell fuel above the Federal Government’s approved pump price of N145. Mr Chinedu Okoronkwo, the National President of IPMAN, had Sunday directed its members to reduce petroleum pump price from N145 to N140 as part of the association’s contribution towards encouraging voters to participate in the election processes. But speaking at the press conference, Fari further reiterated that members who wish to sell at any price below N145 were free to do so because the current government policy that makes the product available encourages price competition. “So, I have not ordered any marketer to sell at N140 and for anybody to issue such directive, it shows such person failed to face the realities on ground. Fari lauded government for the present stability in supply of petroleum products which was better than the previous years where marketers went in search of the product, thereby making it more expensive. He warned that no member should hoard petroleum products at this time because of the election postponement. “My advice to Nigerians, especially the electorate is to get ready and prepare to cast their votes in the Presidential and National Assembly elections on February 23, 2019 and the Governorship and State Houses of Assembly as well as FCT area council elections on March 9, 2019 by INEC.”

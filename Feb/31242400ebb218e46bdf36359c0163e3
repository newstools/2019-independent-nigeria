US network CBS announced it has ordered 10 episodes of the show to be featured on its All Access subscription service. The script for the series, based on the acclaimed writer’s best-selling post-apocalyptic epic, will be written by screenwriter and director Josh Boone, who was behind The Fault In Our Stars and The Stand, and Ben Cavell. As in the novel, the TV show will take place in a world where 99.4 percent of the population has been wiped out by a pandemic, leaving the fate of mankind in Mother Abagail – a 108-year-old woman – and the hands of the few survivors. King said in a statement: ‘I’m excited and so very pleased that The Stand is going to have a new life on this exciting new platform. ‘The people involved are men and women who know exactly what they’re doing; the scripts are dynamite. The result bids to be something memorable and thrilling. I believe it will take viewers away to a world they hope will never happen.’ While Boone said the project is particularly special to him, telling CBS: ‘I read The Stand under my bed when I was 12 and my Baptist parents burned it in our fireplace upon discovery. Incensed, I stole my Dad’s Fed-Ex account number and mailed King a letter professing my love for his work.’ He went on: ‘Several weeks later, I came home to find a box had arrived from Maine and inside were several books, each inscribed with a beautiful note from God himself, who encouraged me in my writing and thanked me for being a fan. ‘My parents, genuinely moved by King’s kindness and generosity, lifted the ban on his books that very day. I wrote King a cameo as himself in my first film and have been working to bring The Stand to the screen for five years.’ CBS All Access also streams The Good Fight, Star Trek: Discovery  and The Twilight Zone.

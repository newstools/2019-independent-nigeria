LAGOS – Rangers International have stated their readiness to turn the tide around the reverse fixture of their CAF Confederation Cup tie against Etoile du Sahel on Sunday. With that in view, ‘The Flying Antelopes’ are already talking tough ahead of the game at Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium, Enugu, as they affirmed their determination to get back on top of the table with a home victory. Rangers added that they remain appreciative to their fans, who kept supporting them day in day out, such that all hope is still high on them reaching the knock out stage, despite Sunday’s 2-1 loss away to Etoile. The media department of Nigeria’s Federation Cup champions rolled out a terse message laced with appreciation, courage and determination on social media, with a view that they will take Etoile to the cleaners at ‘The Cathedral’ in Enugu. “We thank our fans for the massive support. The ‘Battle of Sousse’ is over” The Coal City side posted on their website. “All attention shifts from the chilly Sousse to the sunny Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium, ‘The Cathedral’, Enugu for the return leg scheduled for March 3, 2019. Kickoff is 14.00 hours (2.00pm). #NeverSayDie.” While many observers were thinking of ‘The Flying Antelopes’ going out against another Tunisian side, CS SFaxien in the reverse fixture of an earlier draw in their second match of the series, the Enugu side disclosed that their next game is against Etoile. Gbenga Ogunbote, Rangers coach, had stated that his team is still on course for the quarterfinal berth as he said that the team has put behind them the defeat suffered in Tunisia. “We are not disturbed by the defeat in Tunisia, we will work hard to ensure that we win the return leg in Enugu. My players are battle ready for the return leg,” he said.

LAGOS – The gale of premium losses to the nation’s insurance industry has continued with estimated N46 billion on the line from non-insurance of 9.2 million vehicles across the country. According to the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics (NBS) report, out of estimated 11.7 million vehicles in the country at the end of second quarter of 2018, only 2.5 million are captured in the motor insurance policy records. With only 2.5 million vehicles having valid and active motor insurance policy, the 9.2 million vehicles uninsured, according to industry sources were either carrying fake insurance certificates or failed to renew their expired policy. Non-insurance of vehicles is a violation of the Federal Roads Safety Corp (FRSC) Act, which mandated all vehicles on Nigerian roads to carry, at least, third party motor insurance policy. Third Party Vehicle Insurance comes at a fixed price of N5, 000 for privately used saloons and Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs), while commercially used vehicles are charged N7, 500 and in some cases, N5,000. Investigations revealed that most drivers go for fake insurance papers, because it is cheap, as well as to avoid the wrath of the law enforcement agents, as they have little or no knowledge of the benefits of buying original insurance cover. While some motorists prefer to bribe their way out with law enforcement agents when accosted, some uninsured vehicle owners are unaware that their insurance policy had expired as they were not notified by their insurers. Speaking on the development in Lagos, Mr. Lanre Ojuola, the Nigerian Insurers Association (NIA), Director of Operations, affirmed that the number of active motor insurance policies registered on the Nigerian Insurance Industry Database (NIID) now stood at 2.5 million, even though the total registered motor policies on the platform is over three million.

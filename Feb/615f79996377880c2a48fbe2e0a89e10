The Chairmen of Lagos State Sports Associations have agreed that the only way they could meaningfully develop sports in the state was to focus on grassroots sports development. Focusing on this, they said would pave way for more budding talents to be nurtured to prominence to represent the state and the country in the nearest future at local and international competitions. The Director of Communication, Lagos State Sports Commission (LSSC), Titi Oshodi, said that the chairmen of various sports associations made the resolution at their inaugural forum held at the Teslim Balogun Stadium, Lagos. She said that the Chairman of Lagos State Football Association (LSFA), Seyi Akinwunmi, who presided over the forum expressed his displeasure with the dwindling fortune of sports in Lagos. He noted that if all the chairmen of sports associations worked together and embarked on aggressive developmental sports programmes, the better it would be for sports in the state. He advised all the chairmen of associations to organise regular events that would make sports grow and develop in the state. In the same vein, the Executive Chairman of the Governing Board of Lagos State Sports Commission, Kweku Tandoh, also said that the only way Lagos could reclaim its lost glory is to embark on schoolsâ€™ sports development. He said that his joy was to see Lagos having a pool of talents for sports in Nigeria, adding that he was not bothered if other states were poaching athletes from his state ahead of national sports competitions.

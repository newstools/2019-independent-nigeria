LAGOS – The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) yesterday said it was committed to pursuing the Federal Government’s aspiration of aggressively deploying the nation’s vast gas resources for economic growth. A release by the corporation’s Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division, Mr. Ndu Ughamadu, said NNPC Group Managing Director, Dr. Maikanti Baru, disclosed this while commissioning a $60m Egbeoma Gas Processing Plant in Ebedei Community, Ukwuani Local Government of Delta State. “NNPC is committed to the Federal Government’s aspirations as expressed in the gas policy, environmental policy and domestic gas utilization policy,” Dr. Baru stated. Baru observed that some of the targets under the various government policies include the effective monetisation of the nation’s vast gas resources for sustainable economic growth and a complete end to gas flaring. He added that the corporation was pursuing aggressive growth in domestic gas supply capacity from the current 1.7bscfd to 5bscfd in the medium term, a growth which he explained, would come from the seven critical gas development projects. According to him, aside the gas supply growth, the NNPC was equally committed to the expansion of gas pipeline infrastructure network system. “This expansion includes the Obiafu-Obrikom-Oben (OB3) gas pipeline which is less than 5km to Egbeoma Gas Plant and can serve as a major evacuation artery of the dry gas produced from the plant to the market,” he added. Congratulating PNG Gas Limited, operators of the Egbeoma Gas Plant, Baru noted that the development fitted squarely into the Federal Government’s gas aspiration of using gas as an enabler for energy independence, industrial development, commerce and environmental and social sustainability.

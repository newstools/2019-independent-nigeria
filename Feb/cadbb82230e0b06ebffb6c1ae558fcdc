JOE ASIMOJI P/HARCOURT – The former President of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), Barrister Ledum Mitee has berated the Federal Government for not according oil-bearing communities in the Niger-Delta their rights. Mitee, who stated this in an interview with DAILY INDEPENDENT in Port Harcourt, Rivers State capital, noted that it was unfortunate that despite long years of neglect, people of the region were yet to benefit from the resources in their land. He also said the poverty in the Niger-Delta region was unprecedented and didn’t reflect the huge revenue derived from the crude oil gas rich area. “People from these areas feel that they should get something commensurate to their sacrifices for being the host to all the hazards associated with oil in this part of the world. “They are not getting those benefits. We are not getting benefit. So, we must be able to be put in a situation where we get the benefit from those resources on our land. “Anywhere in the world you can tell from a place what it is close to. Why should we at this stage having the host communities to be partners in the oil industry?” Mitee stated. The former MOSOP President also argued that it was sad that government had continued to focus on militant youths in its amnesty programme, noting that there were a myriad of peaceful youths that should be catered for.

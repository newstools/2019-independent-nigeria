Makurdi – Benue State command of the Nigeria police has confirmed the shooting to death of Boniface Okoloho, Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ohimini Local Government Area (LGA) of the state. This has drawn reaction from the governorship candidate of the APC in the state, Emmanuel Jime, who has condemned the act. Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Moses Yamu, confirmed the killing of the party chairman to newsmen in Makurdi on Sunday. Daily Independent gathered that Okoloho was shot by unknown gunmen on his way home from a party function on Saturday. Yamu, who confirmed the party chairman was shot by unknown assailants, said the police had commenced investigation to unravel the circumstances surrounding his death. He promised to make more details available as soon as the police uncovered issues that may have led to the assassination of the party chieftain. However, up to the time of compiling this report, Daily Independent gathered that no arrests had been made. Jime expressed dismay over the murder of the party chieftain and called on the state government and security agencies in the state to fish out Okoloho’s killers and bring them to book. In a statement by the Communications Directorate of the Jime/Ode Campaign Organisation, the APC governorship candidate condemned, in strong terms, the unnecessary politics of violence and bloodshed which may have claimed the life of the party chairman. “Okoloho was one of the very committed leaders of our party in Zone C (Benue South Senatorial District) and we regret that he lost his life in such horrible circumstance, in the service of his state and his party,” he said. Jime also commiserated with the deceased family, the people of Ohimini LGA, and the entire Zone C, appealing to them to take solace in God over the loss.

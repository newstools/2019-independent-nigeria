LAGOS – Stakeholders in the media industry have tasked journalists on the need to conduct themselves responsibly and exhibit professionalism in the discharge of their electoral duties. At a media stakeholders’ roundtable on Monitoring of Print and Online Newspapers’ Reporting of the 2019 Electoral Process (September to December 2018 Score-Card), which held on Wednesday in Lagos, Lanre Arogundade, Director, International Press Centre (IPC), urged reporters to prove that they were capable of correcting misinformation, disinformation and fake news. Arogundade, who noted that there were a group of people, who due to keen interest, were bent on misleading others, appealed to the mainstream media to use their contact with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and those in authorities to regularly get updated on accurate information, especially on rumours and quickly bring it to the knowledge of the people. Richard Akinnola, Executive Director, Centre for Free Speech, Lagos, said the event was to alert journalists on the need to change their perspective in terms of the visibility they give to bigger parties to the detriment of the smaller ones. Berating some journalists for concentrating most of their reports on the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Akinnola urged them to give smaller parties visibility and adequate coverage during elections. Qasim Akinreti, Chairman, Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Lagos State Council, stressed that for journalists  to be responsible and responsive, they need to know the dos and don’ts of the election coverage. Urging reporters to ensure balanced reportage, Akinreti said they could not afford to be partisan, but “they must ensure balanced and adequate coverage of all the groups and political parties available to them.”

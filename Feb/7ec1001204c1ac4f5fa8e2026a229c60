MINNA – Comrade Abdulaziz Salaudeen, Niger State Chairman of the National Conscience Party (NCP) and Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the state, Inter Party Advisory Council (IPAC), has said  that engagement of National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) members as ad-hoc staff in electoral processes should not be compulsory. Abdulaziz reacting to alleged demands by the corps members whose duties may last for only few hours said, “Going by the body language of the corps members, it is as if they are being forced to do the job when there are millions of jobless Nigerians out there willing to do the job for no matter how little.” The NCP chairman in an interview said, “Government should make it optional now that many of the corps members are beginning to ask for water beds and specified type of mattresses and all the sorts when there are millions of jobless Nigerian youths willing to be recruited to do the job.” Some of the corps members may have been pampered to the point that they would have wished that everything would be the same as in their homes, Abdulaziz said, adding that “participation in electoral process should be optional so that only those willing to do the job are recruited.” Abdulaziz who, however, emphasised the need for adequate security for all staff and non-INEC staff, including corps members participating in the entire exercise urged INEC not to disappoint Nigerians by ensuring they live up to expectations in the re-scheduled elections.

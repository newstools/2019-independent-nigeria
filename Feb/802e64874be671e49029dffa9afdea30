LAGOS – The Centre for Anti-Corruption and Open Leadership (CACOL) has called on the two corruption fighting agencies in the country, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and Independent Corrupt Practices and Other related offenses Commission (ICPC), to immediately probe Marilyn Amobi, Managing Director of Nigeria Bulk Electricity Trading Plc (NBET) over alleged corrupt practices. CACOL, in its statement on Monday, said that Amobi should be investigated for alleged fraudulent payment of at least N2 billion to two power generating companies as well as her involvement in a series of corrupt acts such as subversion of board approvals and infraction of procurement laws. Debo Adeniran, CACOL’s Executive Chairman, in a statement issued by Adegboyega Otunuga, the group’s Coordinator, Media and Publications, recalled that the media had been awash with published investigation in the country’s power sector, which revealed how few weeks after Amobi was confirmed as the substantive boss of NBET in July 2016, she allegedly started overpaying two power generating companies, Omotosho Electric Genco and Olorunsogo Electric Company, in flagrant violation of the details of a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) the companies signed with the government in February and August 2016. Adeniran explained: “Also, embedded within the PPA is the Gas Supply Agreement (GSA) that covers the supply of natural gas to the generating plant and the Gas Transportation Agreement (GTA), which is an agreement between gas transporters and power generating plants. According to the PPA, to qualify for full payment, generating plants must provide evidence that they have active GSA and GTA or else the power purchase agreement would be deemed inactive and would only receive payment for the power they supplied. “The agreement obtained by Leaks NG shows this fact, ‘Seller (Omotosho Genco) hereby agrees that any claim for Available Capacity payment under the PPA are conditional on the Seller providing evidence acceptable to the Buyer (NBET) confirming that it has a legally binding and enforceable Gas Supply and Aggregation Agreement and Gas Transportation Agreement, in accordance with clause 3.2.2 and 4.2.1 of the PPA,” He lamented: “It was, however, discovered that, despite the fact that Omotosho did not provide evidence of gas supply aggregation and transportation, the company continued to tender request for full payment for 20 months. According to available documents, the over-invoicing was detected in October 2017 following an NBET internal audit. “All efforts to get Omotosho to fulfill the condition for the PPA by providing necessary documentation were rebuffed, even as in June 2017, he supplied energy to the tune of 33.16megawatts but invoiced up to 161.74megawatts. “This shows that Omotosho laid claim to an excess of 123.58megawatts as excess capacity for the cycle and requested for payment of N1.023bn instead of N209.82million, leaving an excess of N813.7million for the capacity in June 2016. “Another firm, named, Olorunsogo also issued an invoice of N1.25bn for capacity for June 2016 as against N75.36mn calculated by its actual energy, thus, making the two firms over-invoicing an amount that is up to N1.99bn in just one single month of June 2106.”

AWKA – Still angered by the postponement of last Saturday’s presidential and National Assembly elections, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Anambra State has said that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) was merely postponing the evil day. Chief Ndubisi Nwobu, the state chairman of the party, in a statement in Awka Monday, said no matter the number of times the election is shifted President Muhammadu Buhari would lose. Nwobu said, “If they like, let them postpone it five times, they are postponing the evil day. It will come. Any day the election holds in this country, the Presidency of Buhari would come to an end.” He said that it was regrettable that that a commission that assured Nigerians over and over again that they were more than prepared for the election would on the day of the election abort it and reschedule it for another date. “It goes to show the views of ordinary Nigerians that the present Federal Government is incapable and incompetent and cannot lead this country to any developmental trajectory. “If the INEC cannot conduct an election it prepared for four years and abort it; it is a sad day for Nigeria,” Nwobu said. He advised the commission to look inwards because they should hold themselves responsible for what they have done. He added, “I tell you, this is part of de-marketing Nigeria and it has negative indices because the whole world had looked towards Nigeria holding this election only to hear that it has been cancelled.” Also Mr. Sam Chinedu Onwuaso, the PDP candidate for Awka North and South Federal Constituency in the election, said INEC postponed his celebration day. He said that many people had set up canopies ready to celebrate victory for PDP only for the election to be cancelled. He said, “Canopies have been mounted for the victory that would have come after Saturday. Everyone knows that we would have won.”

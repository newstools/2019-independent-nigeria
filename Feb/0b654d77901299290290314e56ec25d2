Chief Ayo Adebanjo, elder statesman and Afenifere leader has  said there is no way President Muhammadu Buhari can win reelection if the tomorrow’s presidential election is free, fair and credible. Afenifere has already endorsed Atiku Abubakar,  former Vice-president and presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Speaking in a chat with Daily Independent, he predicted that there may be rigging, burning of INEC offices or deliberate arrest of members of the opposition by the ruling party in a bid to manipulate the election in their favour. “There can be rigging by attacking INEC office unnecessarily and closing it down to cause confusion. There can be arrest of the members of the opposition.  There can be rigging directly and constructively by the ruling party to show power. “But I am confident that if the election is free and fair, Buhari is gone,” he said.

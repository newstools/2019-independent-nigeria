The former Managing Director of Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Chief Adebayo Sarumi yesterday suggested the establishment of an alternative corridor as a solution to the constant gridlock in the Apapa Ports axis of Lagos. Sarumi in a chat with our correspondent in Lagos noted that the port access roads could be expanded instead of the city road. He urged the government to compensate the occupants of both sides of the ports access roads and take possession of the spaces for corridor expansion. “The option of opening up an alternative corridor to move cargo out of the Lagos ports was proffered a long time ago. “The idea was suggested when the city started encroaching on the port access roads. “If people had listened at that time and created the appropriate corridor for the expansion, we will not have what we are having today. “However, it is still not too late. I saw a miracle from Iganmu to Okokomaiko where Lagos State created five lanes on each side of the highway, and they were still able to manage a metroline of two lanes,’’ he said. Sarumi argued that during his tenure as the NPA Managing Director, he had suggested that the Apapa port area would need a port approach access on Creek Road up to Liverpool Junction. The NPA former boss, however, said that the port approach access road would also extend from Wharf Road up to Leventis Junction.

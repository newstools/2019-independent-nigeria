Ukraine saw the second fastest e-commerce sector growth in Europe last year, up by just under a third (31%) y/y, according to the Better Regulation Delivery Office, or BRDO, a regulatory advisory body funded by the EU. Only Romania’s market grew faster and Ukraine was well ahead of the global average of 25%, according to BRDO. Russia remains the biggest online market in New Europe and is together with Ukraine amongst the fastest growing on the continent, but Ukraine is closing the gap fast. Ukraine is famous for the quality of its engineers. There are currently an estimated 185,000 tech specialists in Ukraine with another 16,000 graduating each year. And the country has also seen the export of IT services soar in the last year, with many of the world’s biggest tech companies operating offices in Ukraine to tap into the low-cost talent pool. A recent list of the top 50 Ukrainian IT companies is topped by EPAM, which originally hails from Belarus, but is now headquartered in New York and counts the world’s blue chips as its clients. But the company relies on an army of Ukrainian engineers to crunch the code, making it the biggest IT company in the country. At number four on the same list is Luxoft, which was originally a Russian company until its international business was spun off into Luxoft and likewise relies on Ukraine for its worker bees.

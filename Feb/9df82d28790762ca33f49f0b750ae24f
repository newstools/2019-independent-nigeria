A businessman who sells off his controlling stake in a successful and lucrative organisation is either stupid or a genius. However, Femi Otedola is not a fool, as his exploits in the Oil and Gas industry speaks volume. Last year, in the wake of the sales of his controlling stake in Forte Oil to Prudent Energy, many wondered what his next move would be. In the heat of several speculations, he simply revealed that he was divesting his business interest to new grounds. Three months of speculations and Otedolaâ€™s new move has been unveiled. Recently, he submitted a bid for the power unit of Forte Oil. While the deal is yet to be sealed, there are indications that Otedola will be focusing his interest in power generation, having been said to be shopping for priced assets in Nigeria.

Lagos – Super Eagles and Anorthosis Famagusta of Cyprus goalkeeper, Francis Uzoho, has been suspended for another match by the Cyprius Football Association after it was discovered that the Deportivo La Coruna of Spain goalkeeper played with an invalid medical certificate. The football association suspended Uzoho for one match following a ruling on a complaint about the ineligibility of the goalkeeper to face Apollon Limassol on February 2. In a 17-page ruling, the FA’s sports adjudicator ruled that the Nigerian played with an invalid medical certificate and his team, Anorthosis Famagusta, have been deducted nine points. In addition, Uzoho was fined 1,000 euros (N405, 000.00), according to Miami Herald. The goalkeeper was omitted from the squads that faced Nea Salamis and Omonia Nicosia in the Cypriot First Division because his medical certificate was cancelled by the Cyprus Sports Organisation. Uzoho reportedly told police that he was on the plane to Cyprus when the medical certificate was issued and this means he did not undergo the necessary medical before making his debut. Three people,  including Anorthosis deputy chairman Kyriacos Yiangou, were arrested in connection with the invalid medical certificate issued but have been released.

ASABA – The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has thrown the camps of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in Isoko, Delta State into confusion. The situation might not be unconnected with the wrongful published names of candidates against where they ought to contest the March 2 State Assembly elections. The candidates were initially worried thinking that the errors came from the forms and credentials submitted to INEC, felt jittery that the development would result to serious litigations if the blunder was traced to them. According to the final list of candidates released by the commission, sighted by Sunday INDEPENDENT, INEC published the name of PDP candidate in Isoko South Constituency I as candidate for Constituency II, while candidate for Constituency II was published as candidate for Constituency I. The candidate for Constituency I, Kenneth Ogba, appeared among others listed in Isoko South II, whereas he came from Isoko South I. Ogba’s name appeared as number 13 of the INEC final list with a stipulated age of 51 with Secondary School Certificate (SSCE) as his certificate. Also, Ferguson Onwo, another PDP candidate that was supposed to appear in Isoko South Constituency II, was listed in Isoko South Constituency I in the INEC final list of candidates. He is 52 and has Bsc listed against his name as qualification. The blunder, it was gathered had thrown the camp of both candidates into serious confusion as the duo had been running helter- skelter, shuttling between Isoko and Asaba since the errors were discovered trying to rectify the published list, which had since been gazetted and published on INEC website. When contacted, INEC’s Director of Public Affairs in Asaba, Bukola Ojeme, said he was not aware of any blunder in the published list, but promised to verify the claims.

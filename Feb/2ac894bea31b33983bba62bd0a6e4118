MAKURDI – The Social Democratic Party (SDP) in Benue State has said it would this week decide which of the presidential candidates to back in Saturday’s election. The party also said it would decide on which of the candidates vying for the Benue West senatorial district seat to support in the election, since it does not have a candidate for that election in the zone. Hingah Biem, the SDP governorship candidate in the state, who said this while speaking with newsmen in Makurdi on Sunday, however, noted that the party was fielding candidates for Benue East and Benue South senatorial district elections. Biem, who was speaking shortly after a meeting on the way forward following his reinstatement by the court as the state governorship candidate of SDP, stated that disagreements erupted in the party when the leadership of the party substituted his name. He, however, stated that the meeting which had in attendance party leadership, chairmen at the local level as well as coordinators, was meant to reconcile himself with other party members to see how the party could cover lost ground. He said, “We don’t have a senatorial candidate in Zone B (Benue West senatorial district); that will await the decision of the party as we get close to the first ballot, because as interested and loyal members of our party and people of this state who have a stake, we will have to also choose between the two or three candidates, who are vying for Senate in the other parties (in Zone B), and also make a choice among them.”

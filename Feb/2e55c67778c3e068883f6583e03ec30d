Ibadan – Adebayo Adelabu, the Oyo State All Progressives Congress (APC) gubernatorial candidate, on Monday, said the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate in the state, Seyi Makinde, was not prepared for the March 2, 2019 election. Adelabu, who made the declaration in a statement made available to journalists in Ibadan by spokesman of Friends of Bayo Adelabu (FOBA), Bayo Busari, declared that the performance of Makinde at the debate organised by an Ibadan – based private radio station on Sunday showed that the PDP candidate was not ready for the election. The statement reads: “The candidate of PDP in the March 2, 2019 gubernatorial election in Oyo State, Engineer Seyi Makinde, has been advised to take an honourable exit from the race. “This advice was given against the backdrop of the lackluster performance of the PDP candidate at a debate organised by Fresh FM, a private radio station in Ibadan on Sunday. It was crystal clear that Engr. Makinde was not ready and prepared to govern an upwardly mobile state like Oyo. “From his dull and shallow presentation at today’s debate we have come to understand the reason why he stayed away from an earlier debate organised by BBC Yoruba penultimate week. “It’s clear that Engr. Makinde is yet to realise the enormity of the task ahead or his preparedness is not beyond that of a local government chairman. “It’s quite unbelievable that someone who came out to contest for the coveted seat of the Pacesetter State four years ago still finds it difficult to marshal his thoughts, even with the passage of time. “His performance has given credence to the popular saying that you can’t give what you don’t have, and we make bold to say that Oyo State deserves a better candidate and a better deal than Engr. Makinde. “His uncoordinated responses to specific questions and lack of clear thought pattern, while the debate lasted, is a thing to worry about.”

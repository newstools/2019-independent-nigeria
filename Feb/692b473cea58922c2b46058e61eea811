Coach Paul Osahon Aigbogun, Flying Eagles Head Coach, has described their semi-final loss to Mali in the ongoing CAF U20 Cup of Nations as a difficult game. Mali beat Nigeria on penalties to qualify for the final of the U-20 Africa Cup of Nations following a 1-1 stalemate after extra time. While Nigeria lost their opening and last penalty kicks, Mali lost only their first kick. Nigeria’s Valentine Ozornwafor and Aniekeme Okon both missed from the spot whiles Boubacar Traore saw his effort saved by Oremade. They will play Senegal in the Sunday final after Senegal beat South Africa 1-0. “It was a very difficult match against Mali,” says Aigbogun, adding, “and we fought as it should but unfortunately for us Mali won. “We congratulate the Malian team for their victory and qualification. Today we cannot say that something has not worked since the two teams were equal.” Coach Mamoutou Kané of Mali said that the game was an exhausting one, ascribing their win to luck. “Luck was with us so congratulations and courage to the Nigerian coach. “For us the goal is achieved we were the first team to have lost and we are today the first to qualify for the final. “This is football and I could not express my joy like the others because for me what was to be celebrated is the match against Ghana.”

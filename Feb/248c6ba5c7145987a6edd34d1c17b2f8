ABAKALIKI – Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State, on Tuesday, urged his supporters to resist unwarranted arrest, intimidation and harassment from the security agencies ahead of the polls. Umahi alleged that opposition elements in the state were writing frivolous petitions against his supporters and that plans had been concluded to commence their massive arrest from today. He spoke in Onueke, Ezza South Local Government Area headquarters during a rally in the area. He, however, warned his supporters to shun violence and avoid tearing campaign posters and destruction of billboards of candidates of other political parties ahead of the polls. Umahi further urged them to use every available means to resist any unwarranted arrest arising from trumped up charges. “You see APC people are not campaigning, what are they busy doing? They are writing petitions to come and start arrest tomorrow in Ikwo, in Izzi. You must be very law-abiding, tear no poster, no violence, do not do any cultism. But on trump up charges, they write petitions that they come from Abuja, resist arrest. Unwarranted arrest, resist it because we will fight all injustices. “Those who think they can rig elections with security agencies, shame unto them. It will not work. You see, this life is only but once and it is better to die than to live like a coward. Breakdown the bridges, block the roads, we will build them.

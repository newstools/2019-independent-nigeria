The Israeli military says it has started preparations to possibly demolish the house of a Palestinian man who allegedly killed an Israeli woman in the occupied Jerusalem al-Quds last week. The military said in a statement on Sunday that troops had entered Arafat Irfaiya’s home in the West Bank city of al-Khalil (Hebron) in order to measure the structure “to evaluate ways to demolish it.” The statement said the troops “surveyed” the “house in order to examine the possibility of its demolition.” Irfaiya was detained by Israeli forces during a raid in the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah over the weekend. The Israeli police and the regime’s internal spying apparatus Shin Bet say investigations have so far failed to conclusively determine whether the alleged killing of the Israeli woman was a “terrorist attack” or was carried out because of other motives. Circumstances surrounding the murder of the Israeli woman are not clear. Ansbacher, from the settlement of Tekoa in the West Bank, was found dead in the woods at the Ein Yael nature center in south Jerusalem al-Quds late Thursday.

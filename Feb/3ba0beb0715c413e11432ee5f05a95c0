LAGOS – To ensure the industry overcome its current challenges, the Association of Bureaux de Change Operators of Nigeria (ABCON),yesterday emphasized the need for the Central Bank of Nigeria(CBN) to exempt bureau de change operators from payment of Value Added Tax (VAT). The association’s president, Alhaji Aminu Gwadabe, stated this in his speech at the launch of the ABCON live run automation project in Lagos. He said the association should also be exempted from Commission on Turnover (COT), reduce BDCs annual license renewal fee and also expand their scope of transactions,lamented that the BDC sector has been confronted with many challenges that have continued to defy solutions. According to him,some of the challenges include multiple exchange rate, abnormal bank charges, Value Added Tax (VAT) and Commission on Turnover (COT), parallel market operators and illegal International Money Transfer Operators (IMTOs), porous international borders, complex documentation requirements and poor capacity/ skills of operators. He said these hitches have negative impact on BDCs’ efforts toward compliance to statutory and regulatory requirements, adding that six units within the CBN are involved with BDC regulations, supervision, licensing, monitoring.

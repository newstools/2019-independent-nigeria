Oil edged up yesterday as OPEC was expected to stick to its production cuts despite pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, although the prospect of higher Libyan output capped gains. Prices slid on Monday, when many traders were out of the office attending International Petroleum Week, a series of industry events in London, after Trump called on OPEC to ease its efforts to boost the oil market. Prices were “getting too high,” the president said. “Yesterday was a typical price action you see during IP Week when you have a headline,” said Olivier Jakob, oil analyst at Petromatrix. “But I don’t think it will change anything in current OPEC supply policy.” Brent crude, the global benchmark, rose 64 cents, one per cent, to $65.40 around 11:55 p.m. ET (1655 GMT), after losing 3.5 per cent on Monday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude rose 35 cents to $55.83, after a roughly 3-percent fall. The chance of more oil from Libya and expectations of higher U.S. crude inventories limited the rally. Libya’s internationally recognised government agreed with the state oil company to reopen the country’s largest oilfield, El Sharara, according to a statement on Tuesday. U.S. crude stocks were seen 3.6 million barrels higher in weekly inventory reports. The first such report is due at 4:30 p.m. ET (2130 GMT) from the American Petroleum Institute., following by more comprehensive government figures on Wednesday morning.

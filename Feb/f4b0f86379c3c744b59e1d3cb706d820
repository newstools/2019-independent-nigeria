Roger Federer has outlined an ambitious schedule for the next phase of the season, pledging to play in Dubai, Indian Wells and Miami in the next five weeks. The Swiss, 37, insists he no longer cares about his world ranking and is focusing on being competitive with the likes of Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic. “The idea is to be in good health, to know that I can win tournaments, to know that I can beat them (Djokovic and Nadal), and after that it is a pleasure”, he said at the launch of the Laver Cup. “If my ranking drops, it’s not a problem. As long as I can win with a ranking of 17. I prefer to be 17th than third and not win a tournament”, he said. Federer opened his campaign this season by retaining the Hopman Cup alongside Belinda Bencic, becoming the first player to win the mixed-gender event three times. He was seeded third at the Australian Open, entering as the two-time defending champion. He defeated Denis Istomin, Dan Evans, and Taylor Fritz to reach the fourth round, where he faced 14th seed Stefanos Tsitsipas. In a stunning upset, Tsitsipas defeated Federer in four close sets. Critically, Federer was unable to convert any of the 12 break points he held throughout the match, including four set points in the second set. After the match Federer announced he will play the clay court season for the first time since 2016.

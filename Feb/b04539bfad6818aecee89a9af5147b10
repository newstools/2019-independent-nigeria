Lagos – Friday Ekpo, former Super Eagles midfielder, has called on Gernot Rohr, the current team’s coach, to at least play three top-grade international friendly matches before the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Egypt. Speaking on a Radio Sports programme monitored in Lagos on Tuesday, Ekpo said that he would love to see the Super Eagles play at least two or three friendly matches that will give the coach opportunities of seeing his players play under different conditions and employ various tactical options ahead of the AFCON in Egypt. “We need to see all our players before the Nations Cup. Most importantly, we will need to see the team play two or three top friendly matches before going for the AFCON,” he said. The AFCON 1992 bronze medalist, who scored the first goal in the third place 2-1 win against the Indomitable Lions of Cameroon in Senegal, added that he wants to see a situation in which all key players were invited for extensive training towards the tournament. Ekpo, who made top marks in the Nigerian league with clubs such as Calabar Rovers and Abiola Babes before also starring for FC 105 of Gabon during his heydays, said that it would also not be out of place to allow some new players test their abilities as well in the team. He, however, stressed that it was only through friendly matches that Rohr would be able to try out new players and see the regulars on their current form, hence his declaration that the coach must ensure he gets Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) to assist him. “We can create opportunities for some new players to show what they have to offer. The country is blessed with talented players and all we need to do is just to call some of them and give them the chance to prove their worth. “Perhaps, one or two of them can displace some of those currently in the team ahead of the AFCON 2019 in Egypt,” Ekpo added.

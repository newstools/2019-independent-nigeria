In response to the allegations raised by the House of Reps Ad-hoc Committee investigating the activities of the National Pension Commission (PenCom) and violation of the Pension Act, the Acting Director General of the commission, Mrs. Aisha Dahir-Umar, yesterday stated equivocally that allegations are false and unfounded. The PenCom boss, who made this known at the public hearing of the House of Representatives Ad-hoc Committee in Abuja, said: “Our submission is that the allegations are all false and unfounded. The facts on the ground do not in any way indicate any case of contravention of the Pension Reform Act (PRA), 2014, of the commission. “The PRA, as most of my colleagues call it is our bible; we walk by it. It controls every decision we take, so we can never violate it. “We strongly believe that the house does not have the real information and we believe that given the correct information, the house will disregard all the allegations before it.” The Reps ad-hoc committee in its resolution which was passed on November 29, 2018, had raised three (3) allegations against the commission for infractions of the PRA 2014. The allegations are: Unduly creating impasse in the matter of appointment and resumption of duty of the members of the Board of the Commission; Illegal creation of additional Directorates and appointment of more directors, thereby increasing the number from 10 to 17 directors; and Illegal increase of Commission’s Staff End of Service Benefits by 300%. Concerning the allegation of Unduly creating impasse in appointment and resumption of duty of the members of the Board of the Commission, Mrs. Aisha said: “Honourable Members of the House Ad-hoc Committee may recall that following the dissolution of the erstwhile management of PenCom on April 13, 2017 along with the managements of 22 other Agencies and Parastatals, the Federal Government announced the names of a new management team subject to confirmation by the Senate.

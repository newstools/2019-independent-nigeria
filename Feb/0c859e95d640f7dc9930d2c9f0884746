ASABA – Ahead of the March 9, 2019 governorship election in Delta State, leaders of the various factions of All Progressive Congress (APC) in Delta State have signed an agreement, resolving to work together to deliver the party’s candidates. Hyacinth Enuha, an APC chieftain, disclosed this, even as he commended Vice President Yemi Osinbajo for spearheading the reconciliation process among the warring factions. Enuha, a leader of one factions in the protracted crisis that rocked the APC in the state, told Sunday INDEPENDENT in Ogwashi-Uku, saying the accord would take care of interests of the party’s stakeholders. He stated that the agreement had been carefully drafted to ensure that all pending issues were resolved and pending court cases withdrawn. It would be recalled that the mainstream APC led by O’tega Emerhor, the 2015 governorship candidate of the party, did not accept Great Ogboru as the party’s 2019 governorship candidate on the ground that the State Executive Committee (SEC) that conducted the primary where he emerged was not the authentic one.

Abdulkareem Jubril, the candidate of the Accord Party (AP) for Agege Constituency 01, Lagos State House of Assembly, has accused the all Progressives Alliance (APC) of perpetuating violence in politics of the state. He said that the ruling party was using thugs to harass and intimidate political opponents in the state, especially in the local government area. According to him, APC has prevented other political parties from effectively holding rallies and campaigning in the area, adding that billboards and posters of other parties had been defaced or brought down on the orders of the party. Jubril, who is a former chairman of Agege Local Government Area, explained that he left the APC because of impunity and lawlessness on part of the leadership of the party in the state. According to him, the laid down rules and regulations of the ruling party were not followed during the primaries of the party, adding that popular aspirants, who members of the party wanted to represent them were not allowed to stand and that that people who were in the good books of certain powerful individuals were imposed on the people. He told DAILY INDEPENDENT that, if elected, he would introduce people-oriented bills for enactment into law, adding that he would hold regular consultative meetings with his constituents to know what and how they feel about governance. The Accord Party candidate decried a situation in which the voice of the people is not respected, adding that he help the executive arm of government to bring development to the residents of Agege Local Government Area.

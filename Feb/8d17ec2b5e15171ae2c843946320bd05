P/HARCOURT – The factional President of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), Fegalo Nsuke, has described the conduct of Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria, a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell, in Ogoniland as a national shame and crime against humanity. Nsuke made the statement in K-Dere in Gokana local government area, yesterday while conducting journalists around oil spill sites in Ogoni. Nsuke said in a country where citizens’ health and welfare were taken seriously, the oil mining license of Shell should have been withdrawn. “If Nigeria were to be a country concerned about the health of citizens, there is no reason the atrocities of Shell Petroleum in Ogoni would have been left unpunished, in fact, the company’s oil mining license would have been withdrawn,” he said. Describing Shell as a killer, Nsuke demanded the revocation of Shells oil mining license in Ogoni. He said Shells conduct in over 50 years of operating in Ogoni had been very irresponsible, while their continued retention of the license to operate in Ogoni was not justifiable. The MOSOP president said the conflict between Shell and the Ogoni people had been most devastating leading to the death of thousands of Ogonis, which he said could not be easily forgotten by those affected. He insisted that the only thing the government could do was to withdraw Shell from Ogoni and discuss with Ogoni people on acceptable terms for a new operator.

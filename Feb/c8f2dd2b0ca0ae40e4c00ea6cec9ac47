UYO – Persons living with various forms of disabilities in Akwa Ibom State have benefited from life-touching projects worth N10million from the World Bank, in collaboration with the state government. The projects included a motorised borehole, school materials for children, special medicine for leprosy patients and a bus. The intervention was routed through a physically challenged group under the aegis of Hopeful Vulnerable Group (HVG). Reacting to the gestures, spokesperson of the group, Mrs Lucy Stephenson, during inspection tour of the projects facilities by Akwa Ibom State Agency for Community and Social Development Projects (AK-CSDP) in Ekpene Obom,  Etinan, applauded the World Bank for partnering with the state to think favourably of the disadvantaged group. Stephenson recalled that the state government in partnership with the World Bank presented a cheque for N10 million last year to the group to enable them kick start the implementation of micro projects that would help meet the needs of the less privileged in the community. The General Manager of Akwa Ibom State Agency for Community and Social Development Projects, Mr. Ishmeal Akpan, said the funds were meant to execute the community’s preferred projects approved by the World Bank.

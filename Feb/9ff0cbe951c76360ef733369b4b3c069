Great Britain’s Fed Cup team received the home match they were craving when they drew Kazakhstan in the World Group playoffs encounter scheduled for Easter weekend. For Anne Keothavong’s side, who emerged from four matches in Bath last week to win the Euro Africa Zone, it looks a winnable tie although it is unlikely to be entirely straightforward. They will be enormously helped by having the choice of ground, and the match is expected to take place at the Copper Box in London’s Olympic Park. With few venues available at short notice it is among the few suitable candidates and should be able to hold around 5,000 spectators. Kazakhstan’s top player is the combative Yulia Putintseva, ranked 46 in the world, who beat her opposite number Jo Konta last time out in the first round of the 2018 French Open. The current number two is Zarina Diyas, ranked 96 but good enough to have twice made the last sixteen at Wimbledon. The tie will take place on April 20-21, and the winner will gain entry to the 2020 World Group 2, although that could well be expanded to one level of 16 elite teams if mooted changes are passed.

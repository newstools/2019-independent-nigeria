Thousands of Albanian opposition supporters have clashed with police in an anti-government rally to protest what they says is a corrupt and inefficient Cabinet, asking for its resignation and early elections. Supporters of Saturday’s Democratic Party-led rally broke police ranks as they tried to enter the building of leftist Socialist Party Prime Minister Edi Rama. Hundreds of police forces have surrounded the main government building. The US, the European Union and international institutions have called on the opposition to hold a peaceful rally. Fighting corruption and organized crime remain top priorities for the tiny Western Balkan country’s government. Albania hopes that later this year Brussels will decide to launch full EU membership negotiations.

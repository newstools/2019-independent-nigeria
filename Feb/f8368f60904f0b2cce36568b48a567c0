JOS – A northern based Christian cleric and president International Bible Out Reach Ministries International, Prophet Isa El-buba, has endorsed Atiku Abubakar, ex- vice president of Nigeria to be voted as the next President of Nigeria. Prophet El-buba disclosed this on Tuesday while speaking with newsmen in his office. Prophet El-Buba said his decision at tipping Atiku Abubakar as the next President of Nigeria was borne out of consultations he had made with different shades of Nigerians especially opinion molders in the North who have come to a conclusion that Atiku’s wealth of political experience would bring about the most needed unity among the diverse groups of Nigerians cutting across the country. According to him,’’there is not going to be solid block votes for Buhari again from the North in 2019 as the North of 2015 is now different from the North of 2019.’’ El-Buba said while Buhari had the goodwill of the people of the North in 2015, the goodwill in less than four years had been squandered by the cabals that have held President Buhari hostage for this long even though the wife of Mr President, Aisha, had cried aloud over this ugly development.

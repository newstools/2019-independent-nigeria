After recording series of wins that have seen them move top of group A table of the abridged 2018/2019 Nigeria Professional Football League table, MFM captain, Austin Okpara, has stated that the team has all it takes to go all out to make the Super Six and possibly win the league at the end of the season. MFM have recorded six wins in eight matches so far, losing just twice in the process and winning their last four games, including an away win against Remo Stars of Sagamu. Okpara stated that the team’s progress so far had come to many as a shock because of the number of first-team players that left before the start of the season. “This season, a lot of things happened; so many players left the team and the new players are trying to blend with us but with the short time we have, I believe as the games come, we will continue to blend as a team because the new players don’t know all of our tactics yet.” Despite the numerous challenges faced this season and the way the team has been able to pull themselves up and get the needed results, Okpara insisted that they had what it takes to make the top three the end of the season. “I believe we can, with the spirit we are using to play the game this season, I believe that the top three is sure for us this season.”

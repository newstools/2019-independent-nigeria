NNEWI – Apparently angered by the judgment of a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja against the candidacy of Senator Ayogu Eze as the governorship candidate of All Progressive Congress (APC) in Enugu State, Enugu State indigenes residing in Onitsha, Anambra State has thrown their weight behind the embattled Eze, saying that they have decided to join him to fight his cause. The businessmen, who converged under the aegis of Ayogu Eze Support Team, Onitsha branch, vowed to lend support to Eze to ensure that his vision to transform Enugu State became a reality, pointing out that the senator and ex-chairman of Senate Committee on Information and Works was well groomed for the Enugu top seat. Speaking during their meeting at Ochanja Market Hall, coordinator and spokesman of the group, Chief Peter Ugwuonu, said that the attention of the group has been drawn to the judgment against Eze by a Federal High Court, and wondered why APC should nominate an unknown person as its candidate against a ranking Senator, who was popular and acceptable enough to defeat the incumbent governor.

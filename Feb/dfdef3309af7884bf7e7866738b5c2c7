With the draw for the Fed Cup already concluded and the Great Britain team are given a home tie against Kazakhstan , the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) is in favour of London’s Copper Box as venue for the match. TENNIS CIRCUIT gathered that after the success of Bath pulling in more than 15,000 spectators the LTA, will go for a bigger venue if they get the chance, with the favourite very much the Copper Box in London’s Olympic Park. The Bolton Arena would be an outside candidate, but the East London venue is available and could host around 5,000 spectators for tennis, having already shown itself as a successful site for netball. As ever, the problem is trying to find somewhere at short notice, but fan demand is likely to be high after four days of drama in Bath that, once again, underlined the appeal of international team competitions. What will be a straight promotion playoff match will take place on April 20 and 21, with two singles on the Saturday and two singles and a doubles on the Sunday. Among the potential adversaries are Russia and Japan. A victory in that and GB would be promoted to what is expected to be an expanded elite World Group of 16 nations next year, under a promised and much needed revamp of the format. “The logistics are challenging because it’s a very short turnaround in trying to pull together the operational aspects of staging a tie,’ said the LTA’s Director of International Events, Stephen Farrow. “There is a shortage of suitable indoor venues in the UK and with the market for conventions and shows booming in this country they are often booked up a long time in advance”.

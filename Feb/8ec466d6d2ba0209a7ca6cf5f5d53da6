Ahmad Tijjani Abdul Kano – Senator Rabi’u Kwankwaso, (Kano Central) on Tuesday called on the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) supporters in the state to remain calm and accept the outcome of the presidential and National Assembly elections in Kano State. The All Progressives Congress (APC) won all the three senatorial seats and all 24 seats of the House of Representatives Kano. PDP presidential hopeful, Atiku Abubakar, failed to make the minimum 25 per cent of the votes cast in Kano, according to the final results announced by INEC on Tuesday morning. In the result announced in Kano, Muhammadu Buhari of the APC polled 1,464,768 (78.9%) of the votes cast, while Atiku Abubakar of the PDP polled 391,573 (21.1%). Kwankwaso, in a message in Hausa language, said his supporters should not engage in any act that could disrupt peace in the state following dismal performance of APC during last Saturday’s elections. Kwankwaso said, “I call on our supporters to remain peaceful and concentrate on the upcoming governorship and state Assembly elections. We will ensure that we take all lawful steps to prevent problems that were experienced in some parts of the state to achieve victory.” He added, “People should desist from dangerous celebrations like those that happened in 2011 and 2015 where many of our youths engage in dangerous car races that claimed lives and caused injuries,”

Prices of staple food items such as rice, beans, and garri, which were formerly beyond the reach of many, appeared to have come down, declining to an appreciable trend. However, those of imported rice still remained high despite the decline in its prices especially when compared with was sold prior to the ban. With the drop in the prices of beans and garri as well as grains like guinea corn, millet and maize; consumers were able to sustain and even increase their purchases. But then, patronage level seemed not to be encouraging. According to some of the traders interviewed most of who blamed the situation to lack of money owing to the poor state of the economy along with the high inflation rate. Still the decline in prices of staple food items, especially those of beans and garri, has enabled a large number of traders to up their purchases and continue with the trade which was once abandoned for cheaper ones during the period of scarcity. Visits to various markets across some states under the review week revealed that prices of staple food items which witnessed a decline after the yuletide celebrations in 2018, have either remained stable or fallen further. Lack of purchasing power, availability and seasonal factors were predominantly mentioned as reasons for the drop. At the Ogbeogologo Market, Asaba, and that of Igbudu, Delta State, prices of staple food items were at a sliding trend. For example, a 100kg bag of imported rice fell and currently sells within the region of N17,500 and N18,000 against N21,000 earlier sold. That of brown beans also reduced sharply to N35,000 from N48,000 formerly sold. A 60kg bag of the white regular garri at the said market decreased to N3,500 from N4,500 sold previously. Mr. Ebuka Felix, who sells grains at the Ogbeogologo Market, Asaba, said the decline in prices of staple food such as beans, garri and guinea corn was a good omen, attributing it to season of abundance and low demand. The same could be said for those of Nkwo Market, Nnewi, Anambra State especially with prices of brown beans going for between N33,000 and N33,500 down from N42,000 sold before. That of imported rice declined to N17,500 from N18,500 sold initially. Many of the traders at the Nkwo Market, Nnewi, in a chat with DAILY INDEPENDENT ascribed the reduction in prices of staple food items such as beans, garri and plantain to on-season effect while that of imported rice  was linked to poor sales. At the Itam Market Uyo, prices of staple food were also at a declining trend. For instance,  prices of  a  50kg bag of imported  rice earlier sold for between N18,500 and N19,000  fell within the region of  N16,500 and N17,000 while that of brown beans  that previously soared  to between N46,000 and N48,000 reduced to N38,000, a situation which many of the traders attributed to season of plenty. In Oba Market, Benin City, the trend did not differ from those of other locations as prices of a 60kg bag of the white regular garri still remained stable at between N3,500 and N4,000 as against N5,000 previously sold while those of brown beans declined sharply to N35,000 from N47,000 it initially attracted. Prices of small bunch of plantain also dwindled, currently ranging from N500 to N600 down from N1,000 earlier sold. A lady who simply identified as Blessing Iheme, who trades in staple food items linked the drop to improved supply and availability. Checks at  the Northern regions during the week also showed that prices of staple food items like beans, maize and guinea corn were cheap, cheaper than what was obtainable in the South-South due to proximity. For example, prices of a 100kg bag of brown beans at the Achau Market, Kaduna, previously sold for N32,000 fell to N25,000 while that of a 50kg bag of imported rice sold  formerly for N16,500 dropped to between N14,500 and N15,000 as at February 21, 2019. Prices of guinea corn and maize currently go for N7,500 and N7,000 respectively as against 9,500 sold previously. The traders said on-season effect was responsible for the reduction in prices. For Lafenwa Market, Ogun State, prices of food items declined of which many traders ascribed to good omen, anticipating it would reduce further. For instance, a 50kg bag of imported rice which previously attracted N16,000 declined to between N14,000 and N14,500 while brown beans attracted between N28,000 and N30,000 down from N45,000 sold initially. Prices of a 100kg bag of  maize, millet and guinea also experienced downward trend, currently ranging from N13,500 to N15,000 as against between N17,000 and N18,500 sold previously. This, however, depends on the haggling power of the customer and the size of the bag. The prices at Bodija Market, Ibadan, were not different as prices of staple food also decreased.  For example, a 100kg bag of imported rice that previously went for between N16,000 and N17,000  fell abruptly to between N13,000 and N13,500  while those of beans reduced seriously to between N30,000 and N32,000 from N48,000 sold before. Prices of the regular white garri were not different either as prices dropped to between N3,500 and N4,000 from N5,000 sold previously. Most of the traders at the Bodija Market linked the scenario to seasonal factors, poor sales and low demand owing to poor state of the economy. In Lagos, visits to popular markets such as Mile 12, Iddo, Daleko and Oshodi revealed that prices of food items especially those of brown beans witnessed a sharp reduction. For instance, a 100kg bag of brown (drum) beans that initially went for as high as between N48,000 and N50,000 dropped by over 40 per cent, currently selling for between N33,000 and N34,000, a situation which traders are and consumers are happy about. Those of imported rice also reduced to between N12,500 and N13,500 from between N14,500 and N16,000 formerly sold. This however, depends on the location and bargaining power of the customer. Mr. Emeka Osuji who sells food items at the Oshodi Market attributed the trend to lack of money which affected their sales adversely.

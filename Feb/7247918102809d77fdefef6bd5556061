LAGOS – While some Nigerians are still skeptical on the chances of the Super Eagles winning this year’s Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt, Alloy Agu, the national team’s goalkeeper trainer, is optimistic on the team’s chances of winning the tournament. Agu, in an interview with DAILY INDPENDENT, urges prayer from Nigerians, assuring that the Coach Gernot Rohr was doing everything possible to fully fine-tune the team before the tournament kicks off. “I know we love football so much here and I also know that Nigerians are passionate about the Super Eagles doing well in any championship. “By God’s grace, we are going to give our all to make sure that Nigeria do very well in AFCON. Our desire is to win the trophy and that is also the desire of all Nigerians. But remember that it will be very much competitive because other countries going to Egypt also desire to win the trophy. “This is where Nigerians must pray for the team that the players avoid injuries and all the issues that can affect their play. On our part, we are going to prepare the team very well and make sure they lack no motivation to represent Nigeria very well. “I believe in the ability of the Super Eagles to win the cup despite all the oppositions. We are working round the clock to ensure that Nigerians see a team they will be proud of at the Nations Cup,” he said.

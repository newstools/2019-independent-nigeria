As Nigerians gear up for the presidential election this weekend, a set of people who are really under intense pressure to perform are the various Resident Electoral Commissioners (RECs) in the States . Enugu State REC, Emeka Ononamadu, in this brief declares that the election will turn out to be a festival, and that Nigerians, not INEC, will decide who their leaders are. TONY EZIMAKOR brings the excerpts: How ready would you say INEC is for the February 16 and March 2nd elections? I will say INEC is on top of the game.

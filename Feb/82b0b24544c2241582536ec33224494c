Lagos – The First Vice President of Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Barrister Seyi Akinwunmi has charged the Nigeria Under-20 team to go all out in their semifinal clash with Mali at the Africa U20 Cup of Nations in Niamey on Wednesday. Nigeria earned a semifinal berth after defeating the host 1-0 in one of the last matches in Group A on Thursday and in the process finished top of the group with seven points. They are followed into the semis by South Africa who downed Burundi with the same score line on that day. Speaking after Mali piped Ghana’s Black Satellites 1-0 to reach the semifinals and pick the last available ticket to the FIFA U20 World Cup finals in Poland this summer, Akinwunmi, who was Match Commissioner for the Mali/Ghana encounter, said he has confidence in the Flying Eagles to reach the Sunday’s final. “I watched the Flying Eagles against the host team and the fact that they were able to hold their own in such ambience is confirmation that they know what is at stake and have the mettle to face even the strongest opposition. “The Malians are strong, but so are all the four teams in the semifinals. The NFF will continue to give all necessary support to the Flying Eagles to go all the way by winning the trophy.” Akinwunmi, here in Niger Republic as a Member of the CAF Committee for Youth Competitions, had also visited the Flying Eagles at their training session on Thursday.

In the meantime, Rabiu Suleiman Bichi, the chairman, Kano State chapter of Peoples Democratic Party PDP in Kano, has rejected the final results of the presidential, and National Assembly elections in the state. Bichi, who also doubled as PDP agent at the INEC collation centre, said the results did not reflect the views and mandate of the electorate. He said,  “We cannot accept such inflated figures and that is our stand. We will go back and analyse the issue to know the next line of action.” Bichi explained, “As you can see, the presiding officers complained of malfunctioning card readers during the voting exercise and glaring cases of over voting during the exercise.” Speaking further Bichi said, ”We shall look at the circumstances and provisions of the law and see what the law says so as to pursue our rights.”

Lagos – Adegboye Onigbinde, former Super Eagles manager, has called for a relaxed mind for the members of the national team ahead of the June 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Egypt, urging both fans and the authorities to desist from making spurious demands from the team. Onigbinde, who spoke to DAILY INDEPENDENT on the backdrop of high expectations from the team after they seamlessly qualified for the competition, warned that putting undue pressure on the team could affect their overall performance. The coach said instead of mounting pressure on the team to win the competition, it was imperative for the NFF and all the stakeholders to rally round the team for adequate motivation and preparation for the players to give their best. “We should be careful on the demand we are making from these boys,” he responded when the question of a realistic target for the Super Eagles was put to him. “There is nothing wrong in them winning the cup but telling them that you must win or reach a certain stage will put them under intense pressure and in such situation, they could make mistake after falling from high expectation. “I think what they should do is to make sure that the players are adequately prepared and motivated to play. We lack certain cultures here but we must try to always get it right. They will give their best if they are well prepared,” he said.

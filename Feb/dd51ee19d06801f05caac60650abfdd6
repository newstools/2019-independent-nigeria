Meanwhile, Taribo West, Super Eagles’ former defender, has posited that the Flying Eagles’ defence and attack are the two sore areas of the seven-time African champions heading into the Mundial. The former AC Milan and Inter Milan reliable defender noted that the team started well in the just ended Africa U20 Cup of Nation in Niger Republic, but that they lost focus at the most vital level of the biannual championship, thereby failing to qualify for the final. He noted that the team’s forwards at the junior Africa tourney had a lot of chances which they failed to convert, saying that they needed strikers with eyes on goals at every time. “They started well in Niger but lost concentration when it mattered most, the knockout stage. They were also unlucky because the two games they lost were on penalties,” Taribo, a member of the Flying Eagles at the 1993 U-20 AFCON in Mauritius, said.

ABUJA – Northern Alternative Forum (NAF), South-South Professionals (SSP) and Oduduwa Democratic Group (ODG) on Monday dissociated themselves from the recent endorsement of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, by leaders of socio-cultural groups in the country. The regional and professional groups from the six geo-political zones said that the charade called endorsement by the Northern Elders Forum (NEF), Ohaneze Ndigbo, Middle Belt Forum, the Pan Niger Delta Forum and Nigeria Leaders and Elders Forum, does not reflect the true position of Nigerians in the six geo-political zones of the country. The groups, in a statement signed by Gidado Ibrahim, Tunji Yekini, Arinze Goodwill and Mbeke Itah, after their meeting held in Abuja on Monday, told Nigerians to count them out of the purported endorsement. The groups disowned the endorsement of Atiku, saying the grassroots are with the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), President Muhammadu Buhari.” They said: “After reviewing the outcome of the meeting held recently by the Northern Elders’ Forum (NEF) and other ethnic groups in the country, we have come to the conclusion that shopping for a credible President other than President Muhammad Buhari will only come to a dead end.

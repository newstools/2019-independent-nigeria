Supermodel Tyra Banks has announced that she will launch a new experiential attraction later this year themed on the modelling industry in Santa Monica, US. Modelland will take visitors through a fantasy version of the modelling world via interactive entertainment, creative collaborations, curated retail, dining and special events. The attraction will invite selected parties in beauty, fashion, entertainment, food and beverages and technology to collaborate on a number of 360-degree, polysensory experiences. Banks, who presents the popular television show America’s Next Top Model, has said her aim with the attraction is to celebrate everybody’s “own unique beauty”. “Modelland has been 10 intense years in the making,” said Banks. “It’s been my ultimate dream and I have worked tirelessly with laser-focused tunnel vision to bring it to fruition. Modelland will awaken your childlike glee by entertaining and educating in unexpected ways that will make learning about oneself fierce and fun. “I want people to feel seen and validated. Modelland will provide the tools for them to do so and empower them to embrace, adorn and celebrate their own unique beauty.” Set to open in Q4 2019, it will be located at Macerich’s Santa Monica Place, an open-air shopping, dining and entertainment facility near Santa Monica beach. “Santa Monica Place is the perfect setting for the groundbreaking Modelland concept and we are so pleased to welcome this exceptional, multi-layered entertainment, retail and dining attraction to our world-class destination,” said Michael Guerin, senior vice president of leasing at Macerich. “Our top properties, including Santa Monica Place, are terrific platforms for retailers and brands of all kinds to connect with their audiences, who visit us for the best in experience-forward retail and everything else.”

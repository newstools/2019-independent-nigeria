DUTSE – Alhaji Sule Lamido, former Governor of Jigawa State and Peoples Democratic Party chieftain in the state, has said that he would have been jailed by former President Goodluck Jonathan if PDP had won the 2015 general elections. Airing his views while featuring in a popular political programme aired in Radio Freedom in Dutse entitled, “ina gwanin wani,” he said that the former President Jonathan attempted to jail him after his victory. He explained that this followed his endorsement by Chief Olusegun Obasanjo to run for presidency in the 2015 poll when he visited the state during the Economic Summit convened by his administration then. He said the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC)  visited Jigawa State severally and investigated his administration, but failed to prove any of the allegations raised against him. Lamido said he was labeled with series of accusations by Jonathon’s administration and anti-graft body which up till now even President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration failed to prove him guilty. “People are waiting to see my name in a series of corruption cases including Dasukigate and 2015 campaign funds saga in which I was exonerated,” he noted. He said the case was created deliberately by President Jonathan, the former Director General of the State Security service, Ita Ekpengyong; Ibrahim Lamorde, Chairman of the EFCC and his Chief of Staff, Minister of Defence and Minister of Justice and other top government official with the aim of smearing his reputation and political career.

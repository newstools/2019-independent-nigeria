LAGOS – Ogenyi Onazi, Super Eagles midfielder believes the clue to winning this year’s African Cup of Nations (AFCON) billed for Egypt is being focused. He said in a sports Radio programme monitored on Tuesday in Lagos that there were abundant talents in the Super Eagles that could win the trophy for Nigeria, but the coaches should look beyond talents if they want to achieve success. Onazi said that the team’s chances of doing well in Egypt were very high but the coaches alongside officials of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) must do the right thing to see Nigerian team through. “Talent is not the issue to talk about in the Super Eagles, as the team can boast of several good players to flaunt with. “Rather than laying emphasis on the talents in the team, the key factors that must be tackled for the country to have a glorious outing at the competition in Egypt is to be focused as well as concentration and proper planning,” he said. He urged the technical crew to take his words seriously in order to achieve results. “We have the right talents and good players to help us win the African Cup of Nations, but we need to be focused. “Once we can be fully focused on the mission and go about planning for it in the best way possible, we can talk about doing well at AFCON. “One thing is to have talents, another thing is to prepare very well and be focused as well as not losing concentration when it matters most. “If we can be able to achieve the above with morale support and motivations from the NFF and soccer loving Nigerians, we will have no problem in Egypt,” he said. Nigeria have qualified for the AFCON 2019 even with a match at hand against Seychelles next month in Asaba, Delta State.

ADO-EKITI – A Non-governmental organization (NGO), MAI Initiatives for Human Development, has urged the menfolk to protect their daughters, sisters and wives from harmful act of Female Genital Mutilation and Cutting (FGM\C). No fewer than 100 members of the various men groups attended the advocacy programme held in in Ikere-Ekiti on Monday. MAI’s Executive Director, Ayodele Ayotomiwa, gave the admonition during a dialogue with men groups on Zero Tolerance for FGM\C. The programme was in commemoration of International Day of Zero Tolerance for FGM\C. The men groups were drawn from the various artisan groups comprised electricians, tailors bricklayers and others. Ayodele exposed the participants to the harmful effect of FGM and the need for parents to shun it. She dismissed the myth linked with FGM that any women who was not cut risk losing her baby during delivery, stressing that there was no medical report to back the claim. She hinted that only male cutting was established in the scriptures. According to her, FGM was responsible for a number of difficulties encountered by women during delivery. She also disclosed that many women have been infected through the culture of mutilation. One of the participants, Adebayo Peters, an electrician, commended the organizers for the enlightenment programme but urged them to take far-reaching steps in the campaign. He alleged that some medical personnel still indulge in the act, suggesting that the campaign should be taken to hospitals in order to stop it.

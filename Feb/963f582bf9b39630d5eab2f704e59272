LAGOS – Gbenga Ogunbote, Rangers International of Enugu Chief Coach, has praised his players for their brilliant performance in Wednesday match against CS Sfaxien of Tunisia in the CAF Confederation Cup which ended in a 1-1 in Sfax. “It was a good game, no one expected it to be easy (but) we thought it would be more difficult. We were playing against a team that has won the CAF Confederation Cup before. “The winning mentality exists in our team. The moment we conceded, we knew that we cannot lose to CS Sfaxien. “You say Rangers, you never say die. We managed to take back home one point and that’s a positive result,” said Ogunbote. With the result, Rangers retiurn to their base with a precious point and top spot of their Group B table despite tied on four points with Sfaxien. DAILY INDEPENDENT gathered that Sfaxien fans vastly outnumbered the handful of Rangers fans that were present in Taieb Mhiri Stadium. Though their numbers were insignificant, the Nigerian fans cheered Rangers relentlessly throughout the game, often singing and dancing to fight the Tunisian cold weather. Ruud Krol, Head Coach of CS Sfaxien, said that the match was a good one for the two sides. “It was a good game. We played against a good team and they were well prepared. “We gave them too much space in the first half, but did much better in the second half. We secured the lead but made a mistake after. “We left players unattended on the right side and the foul paved the way. We fought to win but weren’t successful. That is football, sometimes you play well and you don’t win, and other times it’s the opposite,” said Krol. Both goals were less than two minutes apart. Ala Marzougui was the first to score for the home side on 71 minutes before Pape Ousmane Sane evened the score a minute later. In the other Group B match, Burkinabe torchbearers Salitas and another Tunisian side, Etoile du Sahel settled for a barren draw in Ouagadougou.

BENIN – Apostle Johnson Suleiman, at the weekend, urged the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) to sanction one of its own, Festus Keyamo (SAN), over what he described as Keyamo’s unwarranted public statements against him based on Stephanie Otobo’s allegation that they were in amorous relationship during which Suleiman allegedly promised to marry her but later reneged. Suleiman alleged that Keyamo tried to smear his name through the media. However, Jonathan Gunu Taidi, the NBA Secretary, dated January 29, 2019 directed Suleiman to within 21 days forward to it a statement sworn before a competent court, a statement of any witness he may wish to call with “concise statement of material facts to be relied upon in support of the petition” with relevant documents to enable it take a decision on the petition. However, counsel to Suleiman, Olayiwola Afolabi, told journalists at the weekend that the way and manner Keyamo went about the matter was unprofessional and that he refused to respond to letters sent to him by Suleiman which he said prompted the decision to petition the NBA. He said Keyamo made spurious allegations against his client beginning from March 3 and began a smear campaign against Suleiman and did not recant his statements when Otobo publicly apologised to Suleiman. He said, “As widely accepted in the legal sphere, an addressee of a letter ought to have taken receipt of it before any supposed action would be taken on it, but in this instance, not only did he make it a subject of media gossips, he engaged in active conversations in the public sphere through print and other media on the matter for which our client had no opportunity to debunk the allegations.” Olayiwola said that Otobo later made a public apology to Suleiman but Keyamo was yet to retract his public statements against Suleiman.

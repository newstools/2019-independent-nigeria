MAKURDI – Benue State chapter of All Progressives Congress (APC) has said that it has no place for corrupt leaders who will pocket funds meant for the people. The party was reacting to an allegation by Terhemen Tarzoor, one of its chieftain in the state, that funds meant for last Saturday’s botched presidential and senatorial elections were diverted by some individuals. Gyado, Second Republic Senator, and Director General, Jime/Ode Campaign Organisation, debunked the allegations in a media chat in Makurdi on Tuesday. While insisting that there was no crack within the party, he disowned Tarzoor, the 2015 governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state, for not backing up his allegation with proofs. He also stressed that the state government never got funds from the Presidency to support the party ahead of the elections that would have held last Saturday.

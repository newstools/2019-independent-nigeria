SUZAN EDEH BAUCHI – Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN) has promised to mobilize 12.2 million people with Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) to cast their votes to President Muhammadu Buhari to ensure that he emerged victorious in the forthcoming 2019 presidential election. Dr Yahaya Adamu Yusuf, the Bauchi State chairman of the association, stated this on Monday while addressing newsmen in Bauchi. He said that the association had vowed that apart from mobilizing 12.2 million votes to President Buhari, whom they noted had done well in improving the plight of farmers in the country, farmers in the state would woo other farmer associations to mobilize more votes for the president. “Seeing the laudable achievements of this administration, particularly in the president’s effort in transforming the agricultural sector, we have no other option than to endorse the candidature of Mr President in the forthcoming general election. “In the Bauchi State for instance, this administration has improved the income of farmers by introducing the Anchor Borrowers’ Programme in which so far 10,000 farmers have benefited. “In 2017 dry season farming, the state had 634 farmers. In 2017/2018 farming season, the number rose to 2,350 farmers. Today, Bauchi State has a total number of 26,000 registered farmers who will participate in the 2019 dry season farming,” he said. The chairman urged Bauchi residents to come out en mass to vote President Buhari in the election, saying that they should see him as an indigene of the state and an elder statesman.

Seven Lawmakers split from Britain’s opposition Labour Party on Monday, saying the party leadership’s failures over Brexit, anti-Semitism and a culture of bullying in the party had left them no choice. The group of lawmakers, calling themselves “The Independent Group’’, included Chuka Umunna, who had at one point been seen as a future leadership candidate. Similarly, Luciana Berger also has been outspoken about the party’s approach to anti-Semitism. Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said he was disappointed in their decision to leave the party.

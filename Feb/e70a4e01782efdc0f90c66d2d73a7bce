South Sudan ceasefire monitors on Monday called for unhindered access to carry out verification on the implementation of a peace agreement. Desta Abiche Ageno, Chairperson of Ceasefire and Transitional Security Arrangements Monitoring, Verification Mechanism (CTSAMVM), said recently that the body was stopped and denied access by government forces at Kegulu checkpoint in southeastern South Sudan. “Again, we urge the government and all the parties to allow the Ceasefire and Transitional Security Arrangements Monitoring, Verification Mechanism freedom of access to carry out its monitoring and verification task,’’ Ageno told newsmen in Juba. He noted that the CTSAMVM is very concerned about the lack of any formal disengagement of forces in close proximity, particularly in Southern Unity State, especially around Leer and Rubkuay areas. “I hope that we can use the lessons learned from the successful disengagement from the areas of Bentiu, Maridi and apply them across South Sudan. “We need to continue to give attention to reports of clashes, unauthorised movement of troops, and denial of access and disengagement of forces at the meeting of the CTSAMVM technical committee,’’ Ageno said. He appealed to the government to serve the body with its Luri investigation report on CTSAMVM members, hold perpetrators accountable for these despicable acts and their chain of command responsible for its leadership failure. “We are still waiting for this report. We urge the government to complete its report soon and acknowledge CTSAMVM’s right to freedom of movement and access,’’ Ageno said.

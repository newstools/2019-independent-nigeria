Lagos – Henry Nwosu, former Super Eagles captain, has warned aspiring footballers in Nigeria to always go through the right channel in procuring their vital documents before venturing abroad for professional careers. He also cautioned officials of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) and the League Management Company (LMC) to know that players’ health condition must be given a pride of place in the scheme of things. The 1980 Africa Cup of Nations winner, spoke to DAILY INDPENDENT on the backdrop of forged medical certificate involving Super Eagles first choice goalkeeper, Francis Uzoho, who has been clamped with a one match suspension and a fine of N.45 million by the Cyprus Football Association. Uzoho, it will be recalled, used an invalid medical fitness certificate to start his game with the Cyprus top division side, Anorthosis Famagusta, against Apollon Limasol, warranting the country’s federation to deduct nine points from the club and handing Uzoho the fine. Nwosu urged Nigerian players to go through the right channel in getting their documents, saying what happened to the Deportivo La Coruna goalkeeper should be an eye opener to up and coming players. “I haven’t been following this though I have heard about it. That is the way things are done over there; there is no backhand dealings and I want to tell our young players to learn a lesson from this. “Also, sports managers in Nigeria should know that the health of players should be paramount in their programmes because it is only when players are healthy that they can give their best,” he said. Uzoho will miss his club’s weekend match.

Nigeria’s leading integrated telecommunications company, Globacom, has offered its teeming subscribers an opportunity to have the cutting-edge headset, Samsung Buds, for every pre-order of the new Galaxy S10 ahead of the launch of the phones on March 8, 2019. According to a press statement released in Lagos on Thursday, Globacom said apart from the ear-buds, which are worth N45,000, subscribers may also get some other benefits from Globacom, such as 6 months of data, for pre-ordering the new Samsung phones from any of the Gloworld outlets of the company across the country. The phone series include S10E, S10 and S10 Plus and were specially designed to mark the 10th anniversary of Samsung and its unique “S” series. The phones come with exciting features that are meant to consolidate the massive success of the Samsung Galaxy phone series at the market place.

AKURE – Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim, presidential candidate of the People’s Trust (PT), has said he had no plan to step down for either President Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressives Congress (APC) or Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, of the Peoples Democratic Party in next week’s election. Olawepo-Hashim said the candidates of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) were beatable considering the woeful performances of their parties since 1999. He disclosed that his party was fine-tuning its strategies in all states of the federation to wrestle power from the ruling APC. “Some days to election, more than 70 percent of the electorates are still wondering who they are going to vote for. “They have been examining the candidates they are going to vote for and what these candidates promised to offer. “Among all the alternative parties, the PT is the biggest. But I can tell you that this election is still very open even though it is 10 days away,” he said. The presidential hopeful, who spoke at a campaign rally in Akure, Ondo state capital, urged Nigerians to support his candidacy for rapid economic development. Olawepo-Hashim, however, called on the electorate to reject the two political parties, saying they have failed the country in the last twenty 20 years. He said the country was too endowed with natural resources for the citizenry to be wallowing in poverty and promised to introduce policies that would end insecurity and economic hardship if elected president. The presidential candidate advised eligible voters to secure their future by voting for his party, assuring Nigerians, especially youths, that he would create jobs and make the environment conducive for businesses to flourish.

Pep Guardiola believes he will able to tell if Manchester City have enough desire to win the Premier League title from Wednesday’s clash with West Ham United. City face Manuel Pellegrini’s side just three days after a gruelling 120-minute Carabao Cup final against Chelsea on Sunday and with the Hammers having played two days’ earlier. But Guardiola warned his players that they cannot use tiredness as an excuse as they try to keep the pressure on leaders Liverpool. “I don’t want to see excuses from players about tiredness or schedules or fixtures — that is nothing,” he told a news conference. “When you have the illusion to fight until the end, to retain the title, it’s the power the energy to give you that is higher than any excuses you can find. “We have to run tomorrow like we are and beat them and after that beat them again. When you are in the last two months of the season, the mentality makes the difference and I want to see my players do this. “People say without this player or this one… it doesn’t matter. We have a good squad and a good second team too. “I want to see the desire that we want to win the title. I don’t care about the way we play or the other things. I want the smell during the game that we can win. “Now that one competition is over I want to see on their faces that they want to win the title and I hope that after the game maybe I will be able to tell you I saw something special.”

The Flying Eagles have received qualification bonus of $3,000 (about N1.08 million) each for picking one of the tickets to the FIFA U20 World Cup in Poland. The Paul Aigbogun tutored side made it to the semifinal of the championship alongside Mali, South Africa and Senegal but failed to make it to the final after losing 2-1 to Mali. The bonus was given to the players just before semifinal match against Mali. The team then went ahead to again lose the third place match 1-0 to South Africa thus finishing 4th in the classification of the four countries that will be flying the continentâ€™s flag at the World cup in Poland. It was further gathered that the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) officials who paid out the largesse told the players point blank not to expect anything as addition to what they have been paid.

Chukwuka Onuwa was a big hit while playing for the Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries (MFM) FC and accounted for the club’s run to the second spot on the NPFL table penultimate season. His sterling performances in the colours of MFM might have led to Enyimba snapping him from the Lagos club this season but the player has found it difficult to adjust in the colours of the seven-time Nigerian champions, raising a huge doubt on his suitability at the former African champions. He was thrown into the fray in Enyimba’s 0-1 loss to Rangers at the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium in Enugu in one of the week five matches. Coach Usman Abdallah preferred his combination with Austin Oladapo in Enyimba’s middle but his performance was adjudged below the expected mark. According to the match rating, his presence was responsible for Rangers’ first half dominance leading to the solitary goal. By the moment he was removed in the 46th minute, Enyimba competed well. Abd’allah likes his midfielders to win the ball as well as carry it. Onuwa’s poor marking abilities made him a liability in that match and subsequent matches and he was the reason the team yielded the midfield to their hosts in that first half that decided the game. At MFM, Onuwa is known for good ball judgment, particularly in one-on-one situation, but Enyimba’s coach prefers winning duels with near-flawless control, which has been lacking in Onuwa’s game, leading to questions whether he can fully fit-in in the lineup of the former champions.

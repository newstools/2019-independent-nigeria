UYO – Former Governor Victor Attah of Akwa Ibom State has blamed election violence in Nigeria on desperate politicians who view their quest to occupy public offices as a do or die affair. Attah, therefore, applauded the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in the state for the successful peace accord organised for all governorship candidates ahead of the elections. At the signing of the peace accord in Uyo on Wednesday, Attah expressed the optimism that the commission in the state would conduct fair and credible elections. The former governor urged Nigerians to be grateful to those notable leaders in the country who started the peace accord process, saying it was a great favour done by introducing sanity into the country’s electoral system. He noted that he got worried when he thought that collation of results in the 2019 general elections was still going to be manual because collation had remained the major problem of Nigeria electoral process. “Listening to the Resident Electoral Commissioner today explaining the method by which collation will be done, I feel quite satisfied that indeed there is a possibility and demonstration that election will now return to the people. Politicians, we turn out to be our own worst enemies.

GOMBE – No fewer than 100 unemployed graduates from the Southeastern part of the country have benefitted from a four-day training programme in poultry production organized by the Federal College of Horticulture, Dadin-Kowa, Gombe State. According to Professor Fatima Sawa, the provost of the college, the programme was a Federal Government initiative through the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development and the Senate Committee on Agriculture. She said the purpose of the training was to empower unemployed youths to make them self-reliant and employers of labour. While commending the Federal Government for the initiative, which she said would go a long way in reducing social vices among the youths, Sawa revealed that the college would conduct 27 trainings in 2019. She added that the current training was the 8th batch so far and that subsequent trainings would be on post-harvest processing, orchard, and fisheries, among other areas. Consultants at the training programme, Mr. Steven Umar of Houge Logistic Limited, Port Harcourt, said the topics treated included poultry management, poultry diseases, packaging and marketing as well as agriculture ecology.

The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has urged the police and other security agencies to respect the rights of the people while carrying out their duties during the forthcoming elections. The South-West Zonal Coordinator of NHRC, Mr Lucas Koyejo, gave the advice at a one-day capacity building workshop for police personnel and some security agencies on Friday in Lagos. Koyejo said that security agencies must respect human rights during the elections, saying that they would in turn gain the respect and cooperation of the citizens. “When fulfilling their duties, law enforcement officers should respect and protect the rights of every citizen irrespective of political affiliation, “ he said. Koyejo urged the police and other security agencies to understand the basic rights of every citizen and to discharge their duties with fairness and impartiality. Also speaking, Lagos State Intervention Officer, Nigeria Policing Programme (NPP), Ms Ivy Basil-Ofili, said the workshop was aimed at equipping the security agencies for the elections. “As elections are coming, we want to see how we can enhance the capacity of the police and other security agencies serving during the general elections, “she said. Basil-Ofili said that 200 participants drawn from the Nigeria Police Force, Nigeria Immigration Service, Nigerian Prisons Service, Federal Road Safety Corps, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, National Drug Law Enforcement Agency and Lagos Neighborhood Safety Corps participated in the workshop. She said that a similar training was organised for some officers in Ogun Command, saying that at the end of the elections, there would be no issue of human rights violation.

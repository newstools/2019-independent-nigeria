She never fails to turn heads with her daring sartorial displays, according to Dailymail.co.uk reports. And Rihanna looked sensational as ever as she went out for dinner in New York City on Friday. The Bajan songstress, 30, effortlessly turned heads in a flowing, bathrobe-inspired fur coat for her night on the town. Wearing a matching snow belt, the singer was well-wrapped up for the freezing temperatures that have swept through the city in the last few days. She paired the coat with a white top and baby blue trainers, accessorising with a gold necklace and a white handbag. Styling her raven locks into waves, she completed the look with a pair of shades. The Umbrella hitmaker enhanced her pretty features with metallic shadow and a slick of berry gloss. It was recently reported that Rihanna has completed work on what will be her ninth studio album. The songstress has also dabbled in the clothing industry and launched an affordable lingerie line last year, Savage x Fenty. Her makeup line has been a formidable force in the industry since its launch in 2017, selling more than $100 million just weeks after coming onto the market. The brand is known for its inclusive range of foundations and boasts highlighters, lipsticks and concealers for every face type. Never straying too far from her first love, the Don’t Stop The Music songstress announced to her fans that the new year will bring new music. She wrote on social media: ‘Simultaneously doing lingerie, makeup, film, amongst a couple other things that I enjoy.’ Rihanna then let her following in on the upcoming album, writing: ‘When the music is ready, you won’t have to ask for it. But it’s coming.’ The album she puts out next will be her ninth studio record – her most recent one, Anti, was released in 2016 and featured such songs as Work and Kiss It Better. She only confirmed that she was dating Saudi billionaire Hassan Jameel in Vogue over this past summer, although they have been together for about two years now.

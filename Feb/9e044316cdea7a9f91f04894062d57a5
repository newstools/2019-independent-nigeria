The General Manager, Corporation Communications of the Nigeria Ports Authority (NPA), Mr Jatto Adams yesterday said technicalities were responsible for stalling in the take-off of its trailer park. Adams, who made the disclosure to our correspondent in Lagos, said that the Federal Ministry of Works, Housing and Power had finally gotten approval for the completion of the park. “The park as you know is located beside the shoreline. So, it is the barricade of the shoreline that needs to be protected. “Now that the work has been approved, the park will soon come alive as the port area will be free of gridlock” he said. Adams noted that the park, which would act as a buffer to trucks plying the ports in Lagos would help to clear the roads of parked articulated vehicles. It would be recalled that movements of over 700- truck Capacity Park, have been causing traffic gridlock in most parts of the Lagos State, and is currently at 90 per cent completion for private sector management.

WARRI – Senator Ighoyota Amori, Director of Administration, Atiku Campaign Organisationen, has declared that Alhaji Atiku Abubakar would be President at the end of the 2019 general polls, berating the leadership of the Independent Electoral Commission (INEC), over what he described as “gross incompetence, loyalty to APC national government and abysmal failure” on Saturday, February 16, 2019. Amori, a key player in national politics noted that INEC as an electoral umpire did not live up to the expectation of Nigerians especially eligible voters by displaying impunity in the conduct of the 2019 general elections, alleging that APC government has election rigging track record in Osun and Ekiti states where clear cases of vote buying and other anti-democratic activities took place not too long ago. He said that the postponement of last Saturday’s Presidential and National Assembly elections gave INEC away as a compromised agency, ready and willing to do the needful for APC especially to manipulate the electoral body in favour of Buhari, noting that any such criminal tendency would be resisted by eligible voters in Nigeria as well as the international community. “APC is not the Messiah party and President Buhari has taken Nigeria 16 years backward within three years and eight months in office; and the entire world crashed on APC the very moment INEC radically shifted the goal post by postponing last Saturday’s election as the nation’s electoral goal keeper. “It’s obvious that Buhari cannot make it back to Aso Rock in 2019; the handwriting is clear, no matter the manipulations which may occur as a result of the postponement. Our presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar shall defeat Buhari with an embarrassing wide margin at the poll. “I wish to appeal to all eligible voters to be calm and focused and to be ready to vote APC propaganda government out of the Villa, so that the restructuring of the Nigerian nation can take place for peace, unity and progress of our dear country,” the statement added.

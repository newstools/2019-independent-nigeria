Ahead of the general elections, the Federal Government has assured voters in Kwara that it will checkmate political thuggery and other forms of rigging. It also promised to provide level playing ground for all parties. The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, gave the assurance on Saturday in Ilorin at the inauguration of the All Progressives Congress (APC’s) new secretariat and campaign vehicles. Mohammed, the APC leader in the state, said Kwara was witnessing a revolution and mass movement against the Senate President, Dr Bukola Saraki hegemony that had impoverished the state for over 40 years. He said in all the elections to be held in the state, the government would guarantee a level playing ground for all political parties and ensure that no voter is intimidated by political thugs. He assured the teeming supporters of APC at the venue, as well as all voters in the state that their votes would count and their desire to end the era of election manipulation and candidates’ imposition would be realised. “Before now, votes never counted in Kwara, average voters were never allowed to vote because of violence. “Now, we are assuring them that this time around the federal government will ensure a level playing field for all political parties. “When that level playing field is assured, there is no doubt that the will of the people will prevail,” he said. He said the edifice and the dozens of vehicles were donated by Alhaji Yakubu Gobir, one of the Kwara APC governorship aspirants who lost in the primaries. The minister added that some other prominent members of the party had made similar sacrifice, including Alhaji Makama, Alhaji Tajudeen Audu who donated the campaign building for the Buhari/Osinbajo Project. Earlier, Gobir said he donated the campaign office to be used as a rallying point for party members to realise their goal of salvaging Kwara from bad governance.

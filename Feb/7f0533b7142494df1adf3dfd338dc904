German Chancellor Angela Merkel officially opened the new headquarters of the country’s foreign intelligence service (BND) in Berlin on Friday, almost 11 years after the laying of the foundation stone. The move to the modern headquarters in central Berlin was completed with the arrival of the school for the intelligence agencies in January and the relocation of the German foreign intelligence service from Pullach near Munich and other locations. About 4,000 of the BND’s 6,500 secret service agents are now working in the huge new building on the Chausseestrasse in the city’s Mitte district. For the employees of the BND, which is traditionally viewed very critically in Germany, and its President Bruno Kahl, the opening by Merkel is an important sign of recognition. A lot has changed with the move from the hermetically sealed former location on the outskirts of the Bavarian capital to the hectic heart of the capital city. The number of enquiries has risen, as have the briefings of politicians and government officials. Nonetheless, the BND is still far from reaching the end of the changes it intends to make. “The service must become even faster, from pure analysis to tactical operations. “While it is important to offer descriptions of relevant terrorist groups, it is even more important to clarify whether someone is about to launch an attack,’’ sources responsible for the work of the BND have said.

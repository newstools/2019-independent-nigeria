Ahmad Tijjani Abdul Kano – Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, the Kano State governor, has bowed to pressure, ordering contractors handling renovation works at Sani Abacha Stadium, Kofar Mata, in Kano, to immediately demobilise to pave way for the campaign rally of Atiku Abubakar, presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), to hold at the stadium. The governor, in a statement by the Commissioner for Information, Youth and Culture, Mallam Muhammad Garba, however, indicated that the directive does not affect ongoing overhaul of the Indoor Sports Complex. Accordingly, the contractor has been directed to remove all machines from the precinct of the stadium till after the campaign rally, while the state darling team, Kano Pillars, had been told to use the Pillars Stadium, Sabon Gari, for its training sessions. The general renovation of the stadium aimed at giving the stadium a face-lift included the installation of the new scoreboard, the running track, and provision of sources for steady water supply to all parts of the stadium. Recall that prior to this development, the PDP had slated February 2 for the rally, which allegedly informed government’s decision to mobilise the contractors, only for the party to fix another date for the campaign rally when the contractors had already moved to site. “As a democrat who believes in freedom of association, His Excellency, the governor, did not order the closure of the stadium to frustrate the campaign rally of the PDP. The stadium only closed for the intended renovation works,’’ the statement said. While wishing the PDP a successful outing, the statement urged the leadership of the party to ensure orderliness during the event in order to avert destruction of facilities at the stadium.

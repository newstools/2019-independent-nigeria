South Africa supports the lifting of sanctions against Zimbabwe in order to allow for economic development, International Relations and Cooperation Minister, Lindiwe Sisulu, said on Thursday. Sisulu said this at a debate in Parliament on the State of Nation Address (SONA) delivered by President Cyril Ramaphosa. Zimbabwe has been under sanctions imposed by the US and the EU for years. The EU lifted most of its sanctions in 2014, but has maintained those against former President Robert Mugabe and his wife Grace. After Mnangagwa took over from Mugabe as president in August 2018, the U.S. government said it would not lift sanctions against Zimbabwe until the new government demonstrates that it is “changing its ways.” Sisulu said Zimbabwe has been going through a challenging socio-economic situation which had inadvertently had an impact on South Africa. “We have engaged the government of Zimbabwe and have a clearer idea of the problem,” she said. “As such, South Africa stands ready to assist the country in addressing these challenges,” said Sisulu.

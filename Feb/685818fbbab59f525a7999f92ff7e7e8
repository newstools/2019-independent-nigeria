In partnership with the African Development Bank (AfDB), South Korea at the weekend declared its intention to step up technology transfers to Africa, officials said in Seoul. Speaking at a meeting on potential technology partnerships between Korea and Africa, representatives of Busan Metropolitan City, Busan Techno Park, and Korea’s Green Technology Center said there was huge potential for cooperation and immense opportunities for job-creating bankable projects. The range of business options included agriculture, green growth, smart urban transportation management, and numerous business opportunities. Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, President of the African Development Bank, said the Future was going to be an exponentially different future. He emphasised that the bank intended to explore the creation of a strategic partnership with Korea that could lead to the creation of a Korea-Africa research and training Drone Centre that could help pave the way for Africa’s fourth industrial revolution.

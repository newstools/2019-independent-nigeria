Nigeria international Uche Agbo revealed he rejected a lucrative offer from China in order to continue his football development in Europe. The 23-year-old opted for a return to Spain by joining Rayo Vallecano on loan from Belgium Standard Liege until the end of the season. The midfielder previously had a spell in Spain with Granada. “It was a big decision to make because the offer and money from China was unbelievable,” Agbo told BBC Sport. “Yes, it’s an awful lot of money from China, some very serious money, but after speaking with my agent, we both agreed that it’s not the best in terms of career progression. “The persuasion [by the unnamed Chinese club] only stopped after I had signed with Rayo Vallecano. “I’m still young, I also have lots of ambition and at this stage of my career staying in Europe is the right step to develop my career. “I understand Spanish football, the way the football is played suits my style and I decided to come back, even though it’s a loan, but playing here will only enhance my development further.

The federal government has called for private sector investment in the women’s league, even as the it has expressed surprise at the late take off of the league. Expressing this surprise on Tuesday is Barrister Solomon Dalung, the Youth and Sports Minister, who also informed of government’s intervention to ensure the kick-off of the 2019 Nigeria Women Premier League (NWPL). “I think we should begin to pay more attention to Women’s football especially after bringing so many laurels to the country,” Dalung stated in a statement. “They just won the Africa Women’s Championship a record nine times and the nucleus of the National team is from the Women’s league.” Consequently, he solicited the support of the public sector to invest in the women’s league like they do to the men’s league. “I seek the co-operation and support of the private sector to rescue the women’s league. The continued delay of its kickoff will hamper the discovery of new players for the National teams especially as the Super Falcons intensify preparations for the World Cup. “If the league fails to start on schedule, how do we get new players to replace the aging ones in the National teams? I understand that lack of funds to call a Congress and ratify the promoted and relegated teams is what is holding the Women’s league from commencing, so I call on public spirited individuals, the private sector and other stakeholders to join hands and support the women’s league to make it a brand,” Dalung appealed. Dalung also promised that the Ministry will put machinery in motion to mobilize support for the Super Falcons’ World Cup campaign in France in June. He said that support from Nigerians whether morally, financially or otherwise would help prepare the team adequately for the World Cup. “I appeal to the Corporate world and all football loving Nigerians to support the Super Falcons not only morally but financially as they prepare to face the world.”

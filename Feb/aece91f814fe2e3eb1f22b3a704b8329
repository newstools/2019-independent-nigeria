The European Union (EU) must recognise Venezuelan Congress Leader, Juan Guaido, as the president of the South American country, US Vice President Mike Pence said on Saturday. Pence, in a speech at the Munich Security Conference, ascertained that not just individual European governments, but the bloc as a whole. Guaido, the Head of Venezuela’s National Assembly, declared himself president of the crisis-wracked country in January, piling pressure on President Nicolas Maduro. He said Guaido, who has declared himself interim leader and had won US and international support to replace Nicolas Maduro. “Guaido deserved the rest of the world to recognise him, and called Maduro a dictator who must step down,’’ Pence said. According to him, it is time for the rest of the world to step forward. “Once more the old world can take a stand in support of freedom in the new world. “Today we call on the European Union to step forward for freedom and recognise Juan Guaido as the only legitimate president of Venezuela,” Pence said.

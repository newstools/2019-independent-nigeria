LAGOS – Mactony Taiwo, former Team Manager of defunct Julius Berger Football Club of Lagos, has counseled the Oyo State government on the late Taiwo Ogunjobi, former Nigeria Football Association secretary general. Taiwo, in a chat with DAILY INDEPENDENT, said since the late ex-international spent most of his life time serving the Oyo State Government, it would not be out of place if the government immortalises his name. “Ogunjobi spent most of life time in Oyo State including playing for the state team, Shooting Stars Sports Club (3SC) and later administered the club to limelight. “Ogunjobi lived an exemplary life during his services to the state and the country in general and should be remembered for the good works he did. “Immortalising his name after his death should not be too much for the state government. This will go a long way to show appreciation for all he did for the state while alive”, said Taiwo. He added that more importantly, the late sports administrator would be buried in Ibadan, Oyo State, with his final journey home beginning on Wednesday, March 13 to Friday, March 15. Ogunjobi died on Monday, February 11 at the University College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan after being admitted on bed rest. Ogunjobi, it would be recalled, captained then IICC Shooting Stars FC (now 3SC) to the final of then African Champions’ Cup (now CAF Champions League) in 1984; he was Sole Administrator of the same club when it again reached the final 12 years later.

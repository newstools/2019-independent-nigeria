Lagos – After making impressive debut for his new club, Middleborough, John Mikel Obi, the Super Eagles captain, may be making a quick return to the national team. This is according to Coach Gernot Rohr, who said that he was impressed with the player’s early progress in the English Championship side. Rohr was speaking on the backdrop of Middleborough’s 3-2 away win over Hull City at the weekend where the former Chelsea midfielder made his Championship debut, having earlier involved in the club’s FA Cup home draw against Newport County just four days after his unveiling at the club. Rohr promised that the coaching crew of the national team would keep tab on the player and follow his progress, assuring that with the way things are going for him, his return to the team is a matter of the moment. “He has adjusted so quickly after playing in the FA Cup and featured in their win at the weekend. We will keep monitoring him just like other players and see how they are progressing. “You know he is our captain; has to play well and I think he is doing just that and we will be happy to have him back as soon as possible,” Rohr was quoted as saying at the weekend. Mikel has been out of action for a long time after injuring himself. On the national team, the player has not been involved since after Nigeria crashed out of the World Cup in June 2018.

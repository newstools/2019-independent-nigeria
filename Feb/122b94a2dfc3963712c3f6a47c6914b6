Remaining civilians are expected to be evacuated from Islamic State’s final enclave in eastern Syria on Thursday, US-backed forces said, clearing the way for them to wipe out the last vestige of jihadist rule that once straddled Syria and Iraq. Iraqi sources said the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which has besieged the last IS enclave near the Iraqi border, handed over more than 150 Iraqi and other foreign jihadists to Iraq on Thursday, under a deal involving a total of 502. The village of Baghouz at the Iraqi border is the last scrap of territory left to Islamic State in the Euphrates valley region that became its final populated stronghold in Iraq and Syria after a series of defeats in 2017. Taking it will nudge the eight-year-old Syrian war towards a new phase, with US President Donald Trump’s pledge to withdraw troops leaving a security vacuum that other powers are seeking to fill.Though the fall of Baghouz marks a milestone in the campaign against IS and the wider conflict in Syria, Islamic State is still seen as a major security threat. The group has steadily turned to guerrilla warfare and still holds territory in a remote, sparsely populated area west of the Euphrates River — a part of Syria otherwise controlled by the Syrian government and its Russian and Iranian allies. The head of the SDF media office, Mustafa Bali, told Reuters the SDF would attack Baghouz once the civilian evacuation was complete – a process he expected to be finished on Thursday.

OWERRI – As Nigerians continue to wait patiently for the weekend’s Presidential/ National Assembly elections, a Pan-Igbo socio- cultural group, “New South East People Consultative Parliament” (NSEPCOP), has queued behind President Muhammadu Buhari’s bid for re-election. The group argued that a short-cut for the South East to realise a president of Igbo extraction in 2023 is for the people of the zone to support the re-election project of Buhari. Speaking in a town hall meeting organised by the group, its  President-General, Udo Agboh, noted that the nation’s presidency had since 1999 rotated between the North and the south, but regretted that the South East had not had a single slot whenever the exalted office comes to the south. Agboh, a former Commissioner for Agricultural, Petroleum, Environment and National Resources, argued that it would amount to a travesty of justice should the presidency elude the Igbos in 2023 and advised the South East not to commit a political blunder that would block their lofty quest and agitation in 2023. He stressed that it was only through the re-election of President Buhari that the envisaged Igbo Presidency project  would come to fruition in 2023. The Director –General claimed that NSEPCOP has well over 300,000 members from the five states in the South-East geo-political zone and that the group was the new voice of the South-East given its large followership. On why he and a few delegates from the group visited President Buhari recently, Agboh said that, the visit to Aso Rock was to draw the attention of the President to the 2023 Igbo presidency project and to lend their support to his administration. Lending his voice, the coordinator, South-East of the group, Emeka Oduenyi, stressed the need for Igbos to key into the process of realising Igbo presidency in 2023, saying that all hands must be on deck to achieve it. Oduenyi advised that the Igbos should ignore anything that could distract them from achieving the 2023 Igbo Presidency.

Addressing the 55th Munich Security Conference, Zarif said, after being sanctioned, Qatar required airspace and trade path. He added Iranians opened their air borders for Qatar. Qatari minister described Iran as a neighbor saying common mineral sources and geography has connected both countries. Expressing unhappiness over differences between Iran and Saudi Arabia, he hoped for these issues to be resolved soon. Earlier in reaction to sanctions imposed on Iran, Abdulrahman Al Thani said despite sanctions, Doha will preserve its ties with Iran. On June 5, 2017 some Arab countries led by Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE have officially severed ties with Qatar and closed air, road and sea lines with the country to put it under political and economic blockade. The 55th Munich Security Conference, attended by 600 international decision-makers in various fields, including politics, trade and civil society, is underway in Munich, Germany, on February 15-17. Munich Security Conference has been held annually in Munich since 1963 with the aim of providing political, economic, scientific and military officials from around the world with an opportunity to explore ways of maintaining peace and establishing security.

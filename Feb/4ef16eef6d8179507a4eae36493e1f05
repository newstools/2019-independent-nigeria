Michael B. Jordan had to seek therapy after playing the villain in smash hit Marvel movie Black Panther. The 31-year-old actor revealed to Oprah Winfrey that he sought professional help after filming wrapped because he struggled to reenter normal life after isolating himself during production to find the complex character of Erik Killmonger. “I went to therapy, I started talking to people, starting unpacking a little bit,” he told Oprah at the recording of the media mogul’s SuperSoul Conversations TV special on Tuesday (05Feb19), reported USA Today. “It was a little tough for me at first. Readjusting to people caring about me, getting that love that I shut out… I wanted to be in this lonely place as long as I could. “Honestly, therapy, just talking to somebody just helped me out a lot. As a man, you get a lot of slack for it… I don’t really subscribe to that. Everyone needs to unpack and talk.” The Creed II star shared that he spent a lot of time alone to channel the character of Killmonger but when filming ended he found it difficult to go back to his usual self and seeing the therapist “helped me out a lot.” “I figured Erik (Killmonger), his childhood growing up was pretty lonely. He didn’t have a lot of people he could talk to about this place called Wakanda that didn’t exist,” he explained. “I didn’t have a process… I just did whatever I felt I needed to do or whatever I felt was right in the moment every step of the way. “I didn’t have an escape plan, either. When it was all over, I think just being in that kind of mind state … it caught up with me.” Black Panther is currently nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture.

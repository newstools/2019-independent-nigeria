Jos – Retired Lieutenant General Jeremiah Useni, the Plateau State Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate, has disclosed that his emergence to run against Governor Simon Lalong was out of the pressure mounted on him by a cross section of the people of the state. Useni, who is representing Plateau North at the Senate, in an interaction with newsmen in Jos, said for long, President Muhammadu Buhari was fed with lies about the peace in Plateau State when in reality, people were being killed by enemies of the state by the day. According to him, if all is well with the people of his state, he would not be appealed by the people of his state to come out and salvage to bad situation on ground. According to Useni, only God has a final say on who becomes the next governor of the state as no incumbent on the Plateau has power to decide his faith as the power to be voted into power and removed as well lies with the people. Useni said he was not too old to be governor of his state as what matters is for one to have sound mind and sharp brain to pilot the affairs of Plateau that is a miniature Nigeria. He promised to return to return all internally displaced persons back to their homes if elected governor of his state. Useni said ‘’If we don’t return displaced youths and women in time, there will be hunger in the state. We should talk the truth so that we can get help, we will make sure we return these people as quickly as possible,” he stated.

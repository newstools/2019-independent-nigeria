Eden Hazard insists that the Chelsea players are all behind under-fire manager Maurizio Sarri, three days on from his dramatic stand-off with Kepa Arrizabalaga in the Carabao Cup final. The Blues were beaten on penalties by Manchester City at Wembley on Sunday, having held their rivals to a goalless draw after normal and extra time. Despite a resilient performance with plenty of positives for Sarri to draw on, Kepa’s refusal to leave the pitch as a substitute for Willy Caballero overshadowed the team’s exploits. The Blues boss reacted furiously after the Spaniard’s defiance and almost stormed down the tunnel before reluctantly allowing him to continue between the sticks. Kepa has since been hit with a hefty fine and there are reports he will lose his spot in the starting line-up for the visit of Tottenham at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday evening.

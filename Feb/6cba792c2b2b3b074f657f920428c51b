Chieftains of the Nigeria Football Federation, led by Nigeria’s Minister of Sports have arrived in London, United Kingdom for a series of meetings with sportswear behemoth, NIKE that have to do with optimizing the performance of the new contract signed by NFF and NIKE in November 2018. The meetings would also dwell on merchandizing, as well as previewing and authorization of a new kit design for the National Teams to be launched in the summer of 2020. Barr. Solomon Dalung, with President of the Nigeria Football Federation and 1st Vice President of CAF, Mr. Amaju Melvin Pinnick and NFF 2nd Vice President/LMC Chairman and Member of FIFA Football Stakeholders Committee ShehuDikko will attend the first of the meetings on Thursday evening at the NIKE UK office in London. NIKE officials confirmed on Thursday morning that Super Eagles’ stars Alex Iwobi, of Arsenal FC of England, and Leicester City FC’s Wilfred Ndidi, have also been invited to attend the previewing of the design to give player options and suggestions. They added that they were delighted to have Nigeria’s Minister of Sports attend the meetings. NIKE and the Nigeria delegation will also firm up strategy to set up outlets (and online platforms) across Nigeria to ensure NIKE kits and other merchandise are more available to fans across the country and the world. It is best practice for the world’s leading kit manufacturers to invite top officials of their clients to preview and authorize a new design before the said piece is produced and launched for use. It would be recalled that NIKE’s special design for Nigeria for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, which sold out on the streets of London hours after it was released onto the market on the first day of June last year, was previewed and authorized by the NFF bigwigs in Year 2016.

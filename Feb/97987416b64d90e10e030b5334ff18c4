Brent oil prices would trade between a relatively narrow range of $50 to $70 per barrel through 2024, with prices ‘anchored’ around $60, according to a new report from Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML). The report specifically sees oil prices rising to $70 per barrel in the short run, but trading within a $50 to $70 range through to 2024. The BAML outlook dovetails with the current futures prices five years out, which centered around $60 per barrel and also fall within Nigeria’s budget benchmark. “Prices will bounce around, but should remain within that $20-per-barrel range,” the report emphasised. A year ago the bank said that the risks to the forecast were skewed to the upside. Now, it believes that the downside risks are growing. U.S. shale supply continues to rise, expanding faster and by larger volumes over the past year than anticipated. Also, demand is slowing and expected to continue to decelerate. In the short run, BAML sees Brent rising back to $70 per barrel. The combination of OPEC+ cuts, involuntary outages in Venezuela and Iran, declines in Mexico and elsewhere, will all contribute to tighter supply. And unlike in 2017, the OPEC+ reductions this time around are occurring against tighter backdrop of lower inventories and a smaller production surplus, which should make the output curtailments more effective. However, the flip side of the OPEC+ production cuts is that OPEC is building back up spare capacity. The phase in of the supply curbs at the start of this year translated into a jump in spare capacity from 1.1 mb/d to 2.5 mb/d “in a matter of weeks,” Bank of America Merrill Lynch stated. Throttling back on production simply means there is more supply sitting on the sidelines, ready to go in the event of an outage. As a result, the supply risks to the market are diminished, which tends to reduce volatility and lower futures prices.

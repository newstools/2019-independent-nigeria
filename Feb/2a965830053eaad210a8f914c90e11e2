The Independent National Electoral Commission says may extend the deadline for  collection of PVCs beyond tomorrow, February 8, to ensure  those yet to collect theirs do so. INEC chairman Prof Mahmood Yakubu dropped the hint at the National Stakeholders Meeting ahead of the forthcoming election, stating that it is not the desire of INEC to  disenfranchise any voter. Prof Mahmood Yakubu also on Thursday, assured that the commission has no intention to postpone  election in Rivers and Zamfara States. While he maintained that INEC will always obey all court orders, he said the commission has put in place contingency plan to hold election as scheduled in those States even if an order of court comes very close to the election day. He however insists that the commission will not honour any conflicting judgement especially when they are issued by courts of coordinate jurisdiction. Details laterâ€¦

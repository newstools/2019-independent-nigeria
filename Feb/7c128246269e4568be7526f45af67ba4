Eminem is furious with Netflix after the streaming giant canceled The Punisher.
It was officially confirmed on Monday that the Marvel series, along with fellow superhero show Jessica Jones, has come to an end after two seasons.
However, the completed third season of Jessica Jones, starring Krysten Ritter, has yet to air.
Disney, who own Marvel, are reportedly launching their own rival streaming service, and as a result, Iron Fist, Daredevil and Luke Cage have also been canceled by Netflix.
While many of The Punisher’s fans were left devastated by the abrupt end of the show, nobody was more vocal than Eminem. “DEAR @NETFLIX, REGARDING YOUR CANCELLATION OF THE PUNISHER, YOU ARE BLOWING IT!! SINCERELY, MARSHALL,” he raged on Twitter.
And one fan cheekily replied, “Just buy the show rights off Netflix and produce under Slim Shady Records.” Jon Bernthal, who plays the title role in The Punisher, took to social media to share his sadness at the show’s cancellation. Writing alongside a comic book illustration of assassin Frank Castle, the 42-year-old thanked his fans for their unwavering support. “To all who have served. All who know loss. All who love and understand Frank and his pain. It has been an honor (sic) to walk in his boots. I’m endlessly grateful to the comic fans and the men and women of the Armed Services and law enforcement community who Frank means so much to. Thank you to the USMC and all the wonderful soldiers who trained me. Go Hard. Be safe,” he shared. Royce Johnson, who also stars in The Punisher, recently revealed that there is hope the show will be revisited. “(Marvel)’s got something in store,” he told ComicBook.com.

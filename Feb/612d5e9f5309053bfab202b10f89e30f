Lagos – Abiodun Dabiri, Lagos gubernatorial candidate for the Abundant Nigeria Renewal Party (ANRP), has condemned in strong term the alleged impeachment move against Akinwunmi Ambode, Lagos state governor, stating that it is totally unnecessary and will not help the nation’s democracy. He stressed that if the lawmakers go ahead with the impeachment plot, the citizens and people of Lagos would react and the Assembly members would live to regret it because their reasons were not sincere. “I think that it is totally unnecessary, but a word of warning to them, if they go ahead and do that, the citizens and the people of Lagos will react. They will live  to regret it if they impeach him because their reasons are not sincere; their reasons are based on financial inducement. “What else do you expect from that kind of Assembly? Do we have credible people there? When they were doing all their Visonscape and all that, they were all there. So, they have suddenly woken up. Their friends have now become their enemy. I think it is totally unnecessary and it will not help our democracy,” he said. Dabiri further stated that most of the actions of a lot of the politicians were always about self, which he said was not good enough for the sustenance of the nation’s democracy.

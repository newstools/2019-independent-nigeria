AWKA – The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Wednesday in Amawbia, Awka South Local Government Area of Anambra State officially declared, Senator Uche Ekwunife the candidate of People’s Democratic Party (PDP), winner of Anambra Central Senatorial District election conducted on February 23, 2019. Though Ekwunife’s victory had been common knowledge in the district 24 hours after the election but the INEC withheld the announcement of the results for 72 hours as it claimed that it was still sorting out results of 35 other polling units in Obosi ward, Idemili North Council Area of the state which is one of the seven local government areas in the district. But on Wednesday morning, the returning officer for the election, Prof. Charles Amobi Nwankwo, while declaring Ekwunife winner, said that she polled of 118,484 votes to beat Senator Victor Umeh, the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) candidate, who polled 81,429 votes to come second. The All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, Chief Sylvester Okonkwo, a lawyer, polled 10,999 to come a distant third. The returning officer said the PDP candidate had satisfied the requirements of the law by scoring the highest number of votes cast in the election and was duly returned elected. Ekwunife, he said, won in all the seven local government areas that make up the senatorial district and beat her closest rival with a margin of 37,055 votes. Ekwunife told DAILY INDEPENDENT shortly after her declaration that she was not perturbed by the delay in announcing her winner by the INEC because she knew going by the field reports from her agents that she won the election squarely in the seven local government areas of the district and would eventually be declared winner.

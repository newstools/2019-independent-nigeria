LAGOS – Leadstream Aviation Training said that it would acquire a simulator aircraft for training of technical personnel in the sector order to bridge the existing gap in the system. The company also said that this would save airline downtime, while demand for foreign exchange would also be reduced. Leasdstream Aviation Training was recently issued with an Approved Training Organisation (ATO) by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA). Engr. Roland Ahmed, Leadstream Accountable Manager in an interview with journalists in Lagos said the ATO was doing a comparative study to show airlines what they could save in terms of cost by utilising indigenous ATOs for their training. He observed that naturally, some of the technical personnel would prefer to travel abroad for such training because of the perceived status it adds to them, but declared that this would not add any value to the system. He said: “We have put our strategy in such a way that we can penetrate into these airlines and do a comparative analysis for them to see how much they are going to be saving in terms of cost, in terms of stress in getting forex and in terms of downtime. If a pilot is supposed to do his simulation and travels out, there will be a lot of ground time because when he gets there he is tired and starts his training in two-three days, finishes his training then he flies again and comes back and he will want to rest again for another one or two days and the airline is losing time and his services. “So we are going to be putting all these together, the stress alone trying to get the slot, they tell you there is none and you have to wait. Then your rating expires and NCAA doesn’t give you extension and so your pilots are due for recurrence, no slots and they are down there, but if they make use of those of us around, it saves the airlines so much, in terms of their operating cost.”

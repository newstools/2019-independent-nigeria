The animator departed the company last year after allegations were made about his workplace conduct. The Nanny McPhee star had already attended some recording sessions for a film called Luck from studio Skydance Animation, which hired Lasseter in January. Buzzfeed News confirmed with Thompson’s representative that she had left the film, and that it was because of Lasseter’s hiring. Back in November 2017, Lasseter addressed claims that he had made some employees feel “disrespected or uncomfortable”. He wrote in a memo to staff: “It’s been brought to my attention that I have made some of you feel disrespected or uncomfortable. That was never my intent. Collectively, you mean the world to me. “I especially want to apologise to anyone who has ever been on the receiving end of an unwanted hug or any other gesture they felt crossed the line in any way, shape, or form. No matter how benign my intent, everyone has the right to set their own boundaries and have them respected.” Originally he was to take a six-month leave of absence but The Walt Disney Company later announced that he was to leave his role as chief creative officer at Disney and Pixar.

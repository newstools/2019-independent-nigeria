Tyson Fury made an incredibly generous promise before his world heavyweight title fight with Deontay Wilder in December, and the ‘Gypsy King’ has confirmed that he made good on that promise. The unbeaten boxer said that he would give away his purse for the Wilder fight and after he was held to a draw by the champion, he has done exactly what he promised. Dillian Whyte aims dig at Deontay Wilder as he plots Dominic Breazeale fight Fury’s purse for the bout was £2.5m, although with pay-per-view earnings on top of that figure, it is believed that the former world champ earned closer to £7m for the fight. ‘I did give away my last purse but I don’t do charity work for a pat on the back,’ Fury said at a Q&A session in Cardiff.

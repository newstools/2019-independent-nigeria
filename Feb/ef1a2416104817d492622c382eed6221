ENUGU – Ahead of Saturday’s rescheduled Presidential and National Assembly elections, the All Progressives Congress (APC), Enugu State chapter has asked the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to recover missing result sheets in some local government areas of the State. Dr. Ben Nwoye, Enugu State APC Chairman made this appeal in an interaction with journalists on Thursday. Nwoye spoke at the APC Secretariat in Enugu after monitoring the distribution of sensitive election materials at the Central Bank (CBN) office in Enugu. The party boss urged INEC to make sure that the result sheets were recovered in Udi Local Government Area and other places where they were found missing. “They need to make sure that in those wards where result sheets were found missing, they were recovered. “We found out that after the postponed elections, the Electoral Officers (EOs) recorded the wards where result sheets were missing.  We have noticed that those result sheets are still missing. INEC should make sure they are returned,” Nwoye said. He added that everything possible should be done to recover the missing result sheets to make sure they were not in the hands of opponents of the ruling party. Nwoye disclosed that agents of APC were denied access into the CBN on Thursday, and there was fracas but it took the intervention of the Resident Electoral Commissioner to allow them to enter and monitor the distribution of sensitive election materials. He expressed the hope that INEC would be able to move the materials to the racks on Friday with all the result sheets for tomorrow’s election intact.

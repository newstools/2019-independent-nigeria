ABUJA – Moves to woo electorate in Benue State has seen President Muhammadu Buhari promising that the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, will soon commence drilling for a deeper search for oil and gas in the Benue Trough. This, he said, would be his next line charge, following the commencement of drilling in the Kolmani River area, located within Bauchi and Gombe states. Buhari, who made the announcement Wednesday while addressing traditional rulers at the Banquet Hall, Government House, Makurdi, Benue State, recalled that as Minister of Petroleum in the 70s, he had seen “very interesting seismic surveys” that promised oil and gas from the Chad Basin through the Benue Trough down to the Delta region. He said for mostly commercial reasons, investment was directed to the Niger Delta given the promise of quicker results. He narrated past efforts by him as Military Head of State to diversify the country’s sources of oil to strengthen its unity, promising that his administration will intensify efforts in this direction. He also welcomed the observation by the Tor Tiv, His Royal Majesty, Professor James Ayatse, that peace had been restored to Benue State following the spike, sometime back in farmers and herders’ clashes as well as the fact that the president had so far conducted a decent and a peaceful campaign. The president promised to look at requests for more roads, bridges and tertiary institutions made by the royal father. Earlier, the Tor Tiv had expressed appreciation to President Buhari, “for the way and manner he has been conducting his campaign peacefully, no riots, no violence, setting good example. We had a challenging time in 2016. Thanks for your intervention, for accepting our appeal to step up security. Operation Whirl Strike has succeeded in chasing away violent herders.”

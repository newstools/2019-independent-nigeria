ABUJA – Hajia Hadiza Bala-Usman, Director, Contact and Mobilisation of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Campaign Council has stressed the need for the party to effectively engage Civil Society Organisations (CSOs ) ahead the rescheduled Presidential and National Assembly elections, and subsequent polls. She said the CSOs are doing a lot to ensure free, fair, credible and transparent polls, which she said was in keeping with the objective of the APC. Bala-Usman spoke while inspecting the election Situation Room set up by Yiaga Watching the Vote Africa at the Transcorp Hilton Hotel. Yiaga would deploy Parallel Voter Tabulation (PVT) in polling units selected at random  across the country to track the voting on Saturday. Bala- Usman said the Yiaga’s Situation Room was very important considering sudden postponement of the election, adding that Nigerians had a right to know what was happening in polling units across the country. She said: “It’s important for APC, as a political party, to engage with civil society, to see what civil society is doing to ensure a free and fair election. As I mentioned, we are keen to have a transparent, free and fair election. So, we encourage observers. We encourage any form of interrogation of the process. So, I am here today to lend the voice of the APC to show encouragement to the civil society, to encourage them to ensure that whatever is happening at the polling unit are highlighted for the world to see and whatever incidences happen are brought up for the necessary agencies. “We want the security agencies to be on ground to provide the necessary support, where INEC is required to deploy additional input and we believe that such situation rooms are very helpful and necessary for such feedbacks.”

Britain said on Monday it would ban Hezbollah, adding the Lebanese Shi’ite group in its entirety to its list of banned terrorist organisations. “Hezbollah is continuing in its attempts to destabilise the fragile situation in the Middle East – and we are no longer able to distinguish between their already banned military wing and the political party,” Home Secretary (interior minister) Sajid Javid said. “Because of this, I have taken the decision to proscribe the group in its entirety.” There has been a long-standing demand on the government from some quarters, including the British Jewish community for a comprehensive ban of the group. However, since 2008 the UK has banned only Hezbollah’s military wing or apparatus, not its political arm. Israel accuses the organisation of being the proxy war machine of both Iran and Syria in its series of attacks against the Jewish nation from inside Lebanon. Several Israeli airstrikes against targets inside Lebanon were often aimed at sniffing out Hezbollah militants in their hideouts in addition to crippling their capacity to wage war against Israel. In its proxy war against Israel, the Jewish nation had always accused Iran of arming the organisation with deadly weapons, prominent among of which are the Katioucha rockets.(

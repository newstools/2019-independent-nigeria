A total turnover of 1.481 billion shares worth N17.647 billion in 20,449 deals were traded last week by investors on the floor of the Exchange in contrast to a total of 2.834 billion shares valued at N28.138 billion that exchanged hands in the previous week in 28,739 deals. At the start of the week, investors reacted negatively to the postponed presidential election before recalculating the political risk and subsequently re-positioning in bellwethers on Tuesday. Analysts at Afrinvest said it had anticipated the market to maintain a positive position till Friday based on improved sentiments on Tuesday, but this was short-lived as they observed more cautious trading in terms of volumes and higher sell-offs before the close of the week. “We believe most investors stayed on the sidelines during the week as the uncertainty regarding the elections heightened by mid-week”, they said. As a result, the benchmark index declined 0.6 per cent Week-on-Week (W-o-W) to 32,525.5 points, largely driven by losses in Dangote Cement (-0.8%), Nigerian Breweries (-3.6%) and Ecobank Transnational Incorporated (-2.1%), year-to-date (YTD) gain moderated to 3.5 per cent while market capitalisation decreased by N74.5 billion to N12.1 trillion.

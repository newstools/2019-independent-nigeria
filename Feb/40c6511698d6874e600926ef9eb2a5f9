ADO-EKITI – The Ekiti state government has warned that anyone who violates chieftaincy laws risk going to jail. It  ordered kingmakers of Orin-Ekiti in Ido/Osi Local Government Area to nominate a candidate to fill the vacant Olorin royal stool in line with the extant law as soon as possible. The deputy governor, Otunba Bisi Egbeyemi, gave the order at a meeting with the kingmakers and other community leaders in his office on Thursday on the chieftaincy impasse. A  statement by  the  Special Assistant (Media) to the Deputy Governor, Odunayo Ogunmola, said  government said the choice of the next king must be in line with the Olorin Chieftaincy Declaration, Gazette No 2. The government’s intervention  was sequel to  a disagreement on the number of ruling houses eligible to produce candidates to contest for the Olorin stool.Six kingmakers are eligible to nominate Olorin; three living kingmakers, while thers  are deceased. While the three kingmakers claimed that the community has two ruling houses, the Olorin Chieftaincy Gazette said there are three ruling houses.The kingmakers claimed that they only recognized the Olubunmo and Famokiti ruling houses. The three ruling houses, according to the Gazette, are Olubunmo, Famokiti and Ajibewa, which is the next to produce the Olorin. Egbeyemi maintained that the state government is bound by the law which recognized Ajibewa as the third ruling house saying “no one can change it.” He  noted that only kingmakers could appoint a king, but government would not allow anyone to violate the existing laws in the state. Egbeyemi, who maintained that administration of Governor Kayode Fayemi was a lover of peace, said government would not allow anyone to foment trouble in the name of ignorance or any benefit.

Conor McGregor rips top contender Kelvin Gastelum for the way that he acted after his scheduled fight inside of the Octagon was nixed at the last minute. Robert Whittaker was originally slated to make his next title defense against Gastelum but had to pull out of the fight at the last minute due to a hernia. This was the original main event for the UFC 234 pay-per-view event. However, the UFC had to make some changes and moved Israel Adesanya vs. Anderson Silva in a middleweight bout to the headliner. It turns out that Gastelum was walking backstage with a UFC title, which just so happened to belong to UFC flyweight champion Henry Cejudo.

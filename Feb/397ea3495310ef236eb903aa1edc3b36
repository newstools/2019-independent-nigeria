Fighters from the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have seized ground from ISIL in a fierce battle to oust the latter from its last remaining enclave in eastern Syria, according to an SDF official on Sunday. The SDF, backed by a U.S.-led coalition, began the assault on Saturday, seeking to wipe out the last remnants of the jihadist group’s “caliphate” in the SDF’s area of operations in eastern and northern Syria. The enclave is close to the Iraqi border and comprises two villages. ISIL still retains territory in the part of Syria that is mostly under the control of the Russian- and Iranian-backed Syrian government. So far, the SDF fighters had seized 41 positions but had faced counter attacks early on Sunday that had been repelled, said Mustafa Bali, head of the SDF media office. “The clashes are ferocious naturally because the terrorist group is defending its last stronghold,” said Bali. The ISIL militants were said to retaliate with heart-seeking missiles, which hit one SDF vehicle, bringing two soldiers dead and several injured. President Donald Trump, who is planning to pull U.S. forces out of Syria, said on Wednesday he expected a formal announcement as early as this week that the coalition had reclaimed all the territory previously held by ISIL.

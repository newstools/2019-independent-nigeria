Abuja – Justice Folashade Ogunbanjo of the Federal High Court, Abuja, has restrained the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) from declaring the Chairman of the defunct Pension Reform Task Team, Malam Abdulrasheed Maina, wanted. Justice Ogunbanjo described the action of the anti-graft agency to declare Maina wanted as unlawful. After counsel in the matter had argued their briefs on Monday, Justice Ogunbanjo made an order of perpetual injunction restraining the EFCC and its affiliates or related bodies from further declaring Maina “wanted” in relation to the subject matter of this suit. The court further ruled that the act of placing Maina as “wanted” was unlawful as it was an infringement on his fundamental human rights. The judge noted that it was done without an order of a court of competent jurisdiction as stipulated by section 41 and 42 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act 2015. Justice Ogunbanjo gave the order in a suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/957/2918 filed by Malam Maina on September 5, 2018. By the suit, Maina had prayed the court to determine whether the EFCC could lawfully exercise the powers of declaring him as “wanted” on its official website or any other media platform, or by harassing him. In addition, the former pension boss sought an order of perpetual injunction to restrain EFCC from further harassing him or declaring him wanted in relation to the particulars and subject matter of this suit. He further prayed the court to order the EFCC, both jointly or severally, its staff, agents, privies, representatives and any other person or related affiliates under whatever name or guise, to forthwith steer clear and remove his picture, name, references, addresses, details, and other particulars from the wanted list published on the EFCC official website or any other related platform where ever it may be.

OWERRI – Governor Rochas Okorocha of Imo State has said that his administration does not owe any bank either in the country or outside the country and that he stands to be challenged by any bank or individual on the claim. The governor also challenged the governorship candidates in the state like Hope Uzodinma, Emeka Ihedioha, Ikedi Ohakim and Ifeanyi Araraume, who have been accusing his administration of owing banks billions of naira to make their facts public or close their mouths forever. Okorocha said this available while interacting with journalists in the at the Government House Owerri, stating that Araraume, Ohakim, Uzodinma and Ihedioha have no programme for the state and, “that is why instead of telling Imo people about their programme for them if elected governor, they are going about talking about Rochas Okorocha and the billions they claimed he is owing the banks. “I know why they are making this debt allegation. It is because of the amazing achievements of this administration. They could not believe that a state government could built six universities, three polytechnics, two colleges of education, run free and qualitative education and has more than one thousand verifiable projects to its credit without borrowing from banks. That is what prompted their story of my owing billions. But my government does not owe any bank.”

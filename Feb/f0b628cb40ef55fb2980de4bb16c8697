LAGOS – Coalition Against Electoral Violence, a Civil Society Organisation (CSO), in conjunction with Save Bayelsa , Save Niger Delta Group have said that any perpetrator of electoral violence in the country should be made to face the wrath of the law as deterrent to other. The groups made the remark in a world press conference at Airport Hotel, Ikeja, on Wednesday, where they expressed dismay at the level of violence witnessed in Bayelsa during the 2015/2016 governorship election which according to them witnessed an unprecedented level of violence, regretting the failure of Bayelsa State Government, Federal Government, relevant security agencies and Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to act on the report that they had submitted, with detailed information on right violations witnessed during the period. Comrade Olufemi Lawson, convener of the conference, said that they would want to inform Nigerians and the international community about the likely hood of violence in some parts of the country, if necessary steps were not taken by government to curb it, noting that they were worried that some persons were preparing to unleash violence on Bayelsans during the forthcoming general elections. Lawson noted that election was not war but democratic process and would want operators to realize that this years’ election shouldn’t be a do-or-die affair. Adding, “We will want a situation where the perpetrators of this crime will be brought to book. We are worried that the report that we sent three years ago on the violence in Bayelsa governorship election did not receive any attention. He said, “During 2015 general election, INEC chairman, Prof. Attahiru Jega announced that a particular senator would be prosecuted for electoral malpractices but somehow, he escaped justice, and even the former governor of Bayelsa was also indicted, and nothing happened to bring him to justice,” he said.

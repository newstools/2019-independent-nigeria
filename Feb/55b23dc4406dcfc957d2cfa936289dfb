Lagos – Victor Ezeji, a member of the victorious Enyimba of Aba team that ended Nigeria’s over three decades search for winners’ medal in the CAF Champions League, has predicted that both Lobi Stars and Rangers, who are currently campaigning in the Champions league and CAF Confederations Cup respectively could go farther in the competitions. The former defunct Sharks of Port Harcourt forward, while speaking to CAFonline in an interview, foresaw a Nigerian club winning a continental trophy very soon, noting that both Lobi Stars and Rangers had done well so far, notwithstanding the setback suffered by Lobi in their home loss to Wydad Casablanca recently. “With the way the trend is going, we are almost getting close. Last season, Enyimba made it to the semi-finals of the CAF Confederation Cup before losing to eventual winners Raja Club Athletic. “Lobi Stars and Rangers have done well so far and I think they can go further especially if they make the quarters. Usually, it’s a gradual process like we did with Enyimba in the early 2000’s before the club became a very strong force. “In the next two or three years, we should get a club to bring back home a continental club trophy. The two Nigerian clubs will be away this weekend. While Lobi will be in South Africa to play Mamelodi Sundown, Rangers will travel to Sousse for a tie against Etoile du Sahel of Tunisia.

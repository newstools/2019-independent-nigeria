LAGOS – David Tyavkase, Lobi Stars forward, has hinged their getting a good result against Wydad Casablanca of Morocco in their CAF Champions League game at the Nnamdi Azikwe Stadium today to being alert throughout the duration of the game. Lobi chance of progressing into the knockout stage depends on winning today as they will play the reverse fixture in four days time in Morocco. All the four clubs in the group are on three points having all won a game and lost one. The former Enyimba player, who won two CAF Champions League title and four domestic titles with the Peoples Elephants, said: “We have to be very fit and alert throughout the match against Wydad. “From my experience, the first 45 minutes and 10 minutes into the second half are the most dangerous periods playing against any team from North Africa; and we must be at alert because Wydad will come hard on us. “We need the three points from this encounter because any of the four teams in the group can go through; I believe we have the team that can play against the best on the continent. “We want to win on Friday in order to be in good position before we travel for the second leg in Morocco,” noted the midfielder. Meanwhile, in the other Group A tie billed for Friday, Mamelodi Sundowns host ASEC Mimosas at the Loftus Stadium in Pretoria as the competition reaches the half way mark.

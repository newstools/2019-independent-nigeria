LAGOS – Gernot Rohr, Super Eagles chief coach has expressed happiness at the return of John Mikel Obi, Super Eagles captain to competitive football. Rohr confessed that seeing Mikel playing for Middlesbrough, gladdens his heart as he believes that the English Championship was better than playing in the Chinese League. Rohr said that the English Championship was of a higher standard than the Chinese Super League, where the Super Eagles captain played for two years with Tianjin Teda FC. The coach reckons that the midfielder needs top quality football on a regular basis for him to remain relevant in the Super Eagles. “I think the Championship has a better level than China, it is good for him (Mikel) to play now. We will see now if he is becoming fit, if he is ready we’ll meet him, speak.” Chelsea on November 4, 2016, announced that they would not renew his contract when it expired at the end of the season. On January 6, 2017, Chinese club Tianjin TEDA signed Mikel. He joined Middlesbrough on a short-term deal in the 2019 winter transfer window. The 31-year-old was a free agent after leaving Chinese side Tianjin TEDA.

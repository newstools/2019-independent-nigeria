Lagos – Lobi Stars might have boxed themselves in a tight corner after losing 0-1 at home to Wydad Casablanca in the 2019 CAF Champions League in Enugu on Saturday but Coach Solomon Ogbeide sees it differently for the Ortom Boys. Ogbeide, while speaking to DAILY INDEPENDENT on what happened at the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium on Saturday, said that much as they never envisaged such result, his club is still firmly in the race for the continent’s top club competition. “We are still in the race. I am not saying that we like the result we got; no, but we still have three matches to play and who says that we will not get the result we need to progress? It is tight right now but we are still there,” he said. Lobi Stars are now third position in Group A with three points from as many matches, even as Wydad are top of the group on six points while Mamelodi Sundown are second with the same point but with an inferior goals difference while ASEC Mimosas are last with also three points like Lobi. Lobi Stars will next travel to Casablanca for the reverse fixture against Wydad, before travelling to South Africa for a date with Sundowns. Their last match will be a home tie against ASEC Mimosas.

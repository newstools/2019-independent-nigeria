Ilorin – Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq, a Kwara State APC governorship candidate, has promised to look into complaints of alleged exorbitant fees being paid by students at the Kwara State University (KWASU) if elected. Abdulrazaq made the promise over the weekend at a campaign stop in Malete where dozens of students of the institution complained of high tuition being charged in the state-owned university. After listening to the complaints of the students, Abdulrahman who was on campaign tour of Kwara North Senatorial District, which including Moro Local Government Area, where the university is located, said, “We will review the complaints if elected.” The APC gubernatorial candidate had spent the last one week campaigning across the north district where he was welcomed by thousands of residents who said they were ready to end the years of alleged tyranny and underdevelopment in the state. During the tour, Abdulrazaq also pledged to access the N100 billion funds the Federal Government proposes to address the farmers-herders’ crisis in parts of the state. He made the pledge while responding to complaints by the Fulani community that the state government allegedly blocked cattle routes and failed to provide potable water or construct water dam for them as it has claimed. The governorship candidate said the state government has, for reasons best known to it, refused to take advantage of the Federal Government offered fund. The Fulani community also called for the improvement of schools in their communities to aid nomadic education. AbdulRazaq, who assured that his administration would be committed to welfare of residents of the state, urged the Fulani community to vote massively for all the APC candidates in the coming polls.

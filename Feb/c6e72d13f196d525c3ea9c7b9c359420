Pope Francis has released 21 “reflection points” for bishops to consider, at the opening of the Vatican’s child sex abuse summit. What seem to be more recommendations than discussion points, considering they’re coming from the head of the church, are aimed at developing a global response to the abuse crisis that has enveloped Catholicism. “The holy people of God look at us and expect from us, not simple and obvious condemnations,” said the Pope.“But concrete and effective measures to put into place.” The proposed measures include things like developing a handbook so authorities know what steps to follow if an abuse case emerges, to psychologically evaluating candidates for the priesthood. Archbishop of Brisbane, Mark Coleridge, gave a mid-summit briefing to hundreds of journalists who have travelled from around the globe. “Really it’s talking about a new way of being the church,” he said.

Lagos – Transition Monitoring Group (TMG), Human and Environmental Development Agenda (HEDA) and the Election Observation Platform have expressed disappointment and regret over the last minute postponement of the Presidential and National Assembly elections earlier scheduled for Saturday, 16th February, 2019. In a statement jointly signed by Dr. Abiola Akiode-Afolabi, Chairperson TMG and Suraju Olanrewaju, Chairman, HEDA noted that despite repeated assurances of preparedness, the attributed the postponement to logistics and operational challenges. “The details were however not explained, neither was any apology tendered. We also note that these challenges have continued to plague our elections over time and now constitute a threat to the integrity of the electoral system. “We cannot continue with the template of poor management of logistics as a reason for postponing elections. Having committed scarce resources to the observation process, the Platform and other stakeholders were looking forward to successful elections,” the statement reads. Adding, “We however, hope that INEC would resolve its logistics issues before the newly scheduled dates for the elections as we urge Nigerians and friends of Nigeria not to be discouraged in exercising their civic responsibility to elect the leaders of their choice to various political offices. It further urged political parties to rise above partisan considerations and also call on their members to refrain from comments and actions that could jeopardise the successful conduct of the elections. “We appreciate the enthusiasm and interest that everyone has shown towards the elections, particularly eminent Nigerian leaders who were carefully picked to assist in the realization of our mandate to support processes which would contribute to the realization of free, fair and credible elections.”

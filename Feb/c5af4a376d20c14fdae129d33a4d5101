Employers who mismanage workersâ€™ pensions pots will face up to seven years in jail or unlimited fines, British pensions minister Amber Rudd said on Sunday, announcing a beefed-up response to a series of high profile corporate failures. Britain has been promising to introduce tougher laws governing the management of pensions for more than a year following the collapse of firms like outsourcer Carillion and department store chain BHS.  Ministers have previously suggested a maximum term of two years in jail, but Rudd used a newspaper article to announce tougher sentences.

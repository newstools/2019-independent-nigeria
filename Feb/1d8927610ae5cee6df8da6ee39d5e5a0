UMUAHIA – Rev Evans Paul, an Umuahia-based cleric, has prophesised that the February 23 poll will again not hold. Rev Paul, who walked into the press centre of the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ), in Umuahia, Abia State capital, on Tuesday claimed that God told him there would be no election in the country until God cleanses the nation. The cleric, general overseer of Praise and Truth Worship Centre, Oboro, Ikwuano LGA of Abia State, who last week predicted that the Saturday, February 16 election would not hold, insisted that God’s anger was upon Nigeria because of the many rituals that were being perpetuated by politicians to win the polls. He said: “Last week, I said at a popular newsstand in Umuahia, Abia State capital, that there would be no election and people there started laughing at me. But, when the prophesy came to pass, they started calling me and praising God for fulfilling His word. “The truth of the matter is that God is angry with politicians in Nigeria because many of them are ritualists who don’t care for the poor masses. How can you explain the fact that the price of kerosene, with which the poor cook, has unnecessarily skyrocketed?” He warned that if any man tried to go contrary to the word of God concerning Nigeria on the election, that person would bear the consequences for others to learn from.

The senatorial candidate of People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in Lagos Central, Sunbo Onitiri, has appealed to Lagosians to be calm in view of the postponement of the presidential election. In a statement issued in Lagos on Tuesday, Onitiri said the postponement was very shocking and disappointing. “To say the least, it is a national disgrace. It is a colossal waste of money and resources. Lagosians have lost two days to the postponement”, he noted. He said the sensitive election materials issued out should be secured and not be tampered with so as to make the election credible. “I, therefore, urge INEC to ensure that the elections hold on the February 23 unfailingly. The elections should be free, fair and credible. The national embarrassment should not repeat itself”. The PDP senatorial candidate also implored Lagosians to troop out on Saturday and peacefully exercise their civic duty by voting for credible, competent and capable leaders that will take Nigeria to the Promised Land and eliminate poverty, sufferings and disease from the country. “Please vote wisely, vote rightly and vote your conscience”. Onitiri also implored INEC to ensure that the elections are free, fair and credible. “INEC should maintain neutrality in this election and show the whole world that it’s an unbiased umpire.   Our security agencies should not take side with any candidate in the interest of peace in Nigeria”. Onitiri advised security agencies not to harass or intimidate voters during the elections.

AWKA – The police in Anambra State has identified some of the most voter populated areas in the state as the major flash points it need to work seriously on to ensure free fair and violent-free elections. Rabiu Ladodo, Commissioner of Police deployed for election duties in Anambra State, named the areas as Ogidi, Obosi, Nnewi, Onitsha, Ajali and Ihiala. Speaking during a meeting with heads of security agencies in the state, he said that identification of the black spots was made possible due to cooperation of all the sister security agencies with police. He called on politicians, especially candidates vying for positions, to play by the rules. Ladodo also appealed to community leaders to advise their subjects against involvement in acts capable of affecting the elections negatively. He promised that on their part as security agents, they would be professional in the discharge of their duties. Ladodo called on the public to massively participate in the elections, adding that enough arrangements had been made by INEC and security agencies to make the elections hitch-free. He added: “On my arrival in Awka yesterday, I went straight to Central Bank of Nigeria, Awka, where the sensitive materials for the elections were distributed to all the local government areas. “The brief I got from the INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner showed that all the 21 council areas have received their materials and with the support of the security personnel we hope to have smooth elections,” he concluded.

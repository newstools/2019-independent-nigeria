LAGOS – Mr. Debo Adeniran, Executive Chairman, Centre for Anti-Corruption and Open Leadership (CACOL), has called on the Federal Government to block all loopholes that make it easy for diversion of revenues. Adeniran in a statement issued on Tuesday by Adegboyega Otunuga, the group’s Coordinator for Media and Publications, lamented that notwithstanding the on-going anti-corruption war, some government agencies still divert or refuse to fully account for generated revenue. He was reacting to Monday’s revelation by President Muhammadu Buhari while inaugurating the new board of the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC), that some Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) had not been sincere in accounting for the revenues they generate three and a half years into the anti-graft war. The new ICPC board is headed by Professor Bolaji Owasanoye, the immediate-past secretary of the Presidential Advisory Committee against Corruption (PACAC). Adeniran lamented that despite the commendable strides by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and ICPC, under the current administration, some government agencies and officials had continued to wallow in corrupt practices. He stated, “We would all recollect that before the advent of this administration in 2015, the pattern was for many government agencies and parastatals like the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB), to always cry out for government’s subvention by insisting that it could not break even from what it was charging candidates sitting for its examinations.

Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer insists no player is undroppable at Old Trafford. The Red Devils take on Jose Mourinho’s Tottenham at the Theatre of Dreams on Wednesday as the Portuguese returns to the club for the first time since being sacked last December. A number of United players came in for criticism after Sunday’s 2-2 draw against Aston Villa, which left the club eight points off the top four. The visit of Tottenham marks the start of a critical week for Solskjaer and he’s vowed that no player is beyond reproach, UK Metro. Players are never undroppable,” Solskjaer stressed. ‘As I said here earlier on, players are also playing for their place in the long-term. We have a situation at the moment where we’ve had injuries, so players have played.’ Anthony Martial came in for the fiercest criticism after Sunday’s match but the Frenchman may not have the chance to respond as reports claim he’s set to miss tonight’s match. That could see United move to a back three to accommodate Axel Tuanzebe, which would provide a reprieve for Victor Lindelof.

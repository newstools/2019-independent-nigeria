Abuja – Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), on Wednesday, disclosed that the Federal Government will launch a probe into the circumstances surrounding the alleged invasion of the Federal High Court by operatives of the Department of State Services (DSS) to arrest the convener of the #RevolutionNow protest, Omoyele Sowore.
To this end, Malami said the Federal Government has set up an investigation panel to look into the incidence that happened at the court premises last week.
Malami stated this when he paid a courtesy visit on the newly appointed Chief Judge of the Federal High Court, Justice John Tsoho.
He said he was at the Federal High Court to identify with Justice Tsoho and congratulate him for his appointment and confirmation as the substantive Chief Judge of the court.
While expressing the commitment of the Federal Government to the sanctity of the judicial system and rule of law, Malami said the present administration has established a tradition of ensuring the independence of the judiciary and adherence to the rule of law.
“Whatever affects the integrity of the court is worrisome to us as a government.
“We have set up mechanism for the investigation of the reported incidence and I will not pre-empt the findings of the committee in a matter that I did not witness”.
The AGF, therefore, assured of government’s commitment to upholding the independence of the judiciary.
Recall that the DSS invaded the Federal High Court sitting before Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu and re-arrested Sowore, the publisher of the Sahara Reporters and his co-defendant, Adebayo Bakare.

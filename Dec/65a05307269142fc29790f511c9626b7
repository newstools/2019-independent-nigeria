AWKA – The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has added its voice to the call for the dismantling of the numerous security checkpoints in southern Nigeria, saying they are needed more in the north where there are security challenges. The group made this known in a statement signed by its Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful. Felicitating with members on the yuletide, Powerful said that the Federal Government will be compelled in due course to dismantle all their extortionate Police, Army, Road Safety, Customs, and Civil Defense Corps checkpoints along major roads into Biafraland. The statement advised the Nigeria Army and Police to take their security checkpoints to the north where there is raging Fulani induced insurgency and soldiers are being slaughtered like animals. “Also the dictatorial and lawless of the Nigerian government must stop their usual killing, abduction, intimidation and the humiliation of commuters during this festive period as every death, disappearance or abduction of any Biafran will attract a commensurate response from the public,” Powerful said. The statement further warned all corrupt leaders and groups who were involved in bringing RUGA and Fulani military into Biafra land as a way of silencing IPOB, reducing its population and intimidating them into accepting the Fulanisation of their land as a way of life, to retrace their steps. “They must stay away from anything that may cast them in bad light given that the people are highly upset and would not hesitate to vent their anger on any person or group of persons found to be a Fulani collaborator,” the statement said.

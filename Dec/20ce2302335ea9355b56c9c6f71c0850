ASABA – The Delta State government has warned that anybody or group parading court judgments must execute such judgments within the confines of the law. The government’s advice might not be unconnected with the protest by landlords whose properties were demolished by suspected agents of an Asaba-based company over ownership of lands in Airport View Estate, Vanguard and Marble Hill Areas. Secretary to the State Government, SSG, Mr Chiedu Ebie, who addressed over 100 landlords who staged a protest at the main gate of Government House, warned against any ulterior motives for demolitions. While assuring that as a government and as a state, it would continue to protect them at all times, he thanked the protesters for their peaceful conduct. Ebie, in company of Commissioners for Information, Mr Charles Aniagwu, his Lands counterpart, Mr Churchill Amagada, and Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Mr Olisa Ifeajika, promised that government would look into their complaints with a view to resolving all issues. “As a government, we have a responsibility to continue to provide for our citizens and to protect lives and property. “The best thing we need to do now is to sit down with all stakeholders and look at the documents to find out who has valid title to the disputed lands,” he said. The SSG advised the people to send some representatives to his office to discuss the issues immediately.

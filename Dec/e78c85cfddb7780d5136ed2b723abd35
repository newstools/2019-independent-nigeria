The Federal Government has accused the Republic of Benin of being recalcitrant in its importation of prohibited goods for ultimate dumping in to Nigeria’s market in spite the partial border closure order. Alhaji Lai Mohammed, Minister of Information and Culture, made the allegation when he featured on a ‘TV Continental’ live programme, “Regrettably, the signs out there are not positive in the sense that in the last few weeks, the amounts of seizures that have been made do not show that our neighbours are in a hurry to comply with Nigeria. “As we speak today, there are three ships heading toward Benin Republic laden with about 105,000 metric tons of rice. This is a country of about 12 million people. That rice is meant for ultimate consumption of Nigerians. “In addition, Benin Republic just negotiated with Japan to receive rice worth $30 million. It is clear that the ultimate destination of the rice will be Nigeria and that is why we are appealing to our neighbours. “First preservation is the first law of survival, we are doing this to preserve our economy and the security of our country,” he said. The minister, who disclosed that the border drill would be in place as long as necessary, noted that Nigeria could no longer continue to play the big brother at the expense of its economy and national security. “The facts at our disposal reveal that 10,000 vehicles are imported every month into the Cotonou seaport. “For a population of about 12 million people to be importing 120,000 vehicles in a year means that the vehicles are going to Nigeria with sufficient market. “As I have said, there is no gain without pain, there will be discomfort at the beginning ultimately we believe it is going to be to the ultimate interest of Nigeria,” he said. The minister reiterated that both Benin Republic and Niger Republic were hurting Nigeria’s economy and security because of their non compliance with the ECOWAS Protocol on Transit Goods and State of Origin.

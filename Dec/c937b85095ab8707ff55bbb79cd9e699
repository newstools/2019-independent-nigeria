ABUJA â€“ The National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN) has said honouring individuals and organisations that make frantic efforts towards youth development would go a long way in encouraging many to do more. It stressed that youth development had been identified as the fulcrum for economic and national development. Consequently, the task had not only fallen on government alone, but well-meaning individuals and organisations. The NYCN, in a statement issued in Abuja by its National President, Comrade Solomon Adodo, said Dr. Jack Rich Tein Jr, founder and president of Belemaoil Producing Ltd, had contributed to the cause of Nigerian youths through selfless investment in providing jobs and sponsoring trainings, empowerment programs, seminars and foreign exchange programmes.

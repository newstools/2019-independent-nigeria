Alan Shearer said Manchester United could have scored five times in their victory over Manchester City on Saturday, such was their first-half dominance at the Etihad. United led 2-0 at half-time and eventually ran out 2-1 winners courtesy of goals from Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial, Manchester Evening News. The result leaves City 14 points off Premier League leaders Liverpool and Shearer believes City’s game-plan suited United’s pacy attackers down to the ground. “City played right into United’s hands, they (United) exploited it brilliantly in terms of how quick they were in attack, they had the width, the pace and the intensity,” Shearer said on Match of the Day. “They attacked with aggression and time after time, City left three on four and United punished them. It’s no exaggeration, it could have been and should have been four or five. “They opened them up with ease every time they went forward. When teams are brave and prepared to get through their press, it’s there for you.

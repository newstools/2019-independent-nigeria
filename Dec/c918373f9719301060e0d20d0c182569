ABUJA – Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Area Council Service Secretariat (ACSS) has said it has devised measures to stimulate grassroots development at the six area councils in the territory. This is coming on the heels of the recent order given by FCT Minister, Mallam Muhammad Musa Bello, to the area council chairmen to be prudent in utilization of their monthly statutory allocation, and also ensure that the funds were used in the provision of good governance to residents. The acting secretary, ACSS, Mrs. Omolola Olanipekun, said among the first steps taken by the secretariat towards grassroots development in the area councils was the decision to resolve all chieftaincy tussles. She, however, noted that peaceful co-existence amongst residents was essential to socio-economic development, adding that several interventions had been initiated to address chieftaincy issues that have hampered progress in the communities. According to her, “The Department of Chieftaincy and Community Development   had successfully intervened in the resolution of the community conflicts in the communities across the six area councils.” She added that, several communities across the six area councils have benefited from the intervention programme aimed at restoring peace and healing relationships. Omolola pointed out that Tunga Maje in Gwagwalada Area Council, Kubwa in Bwari Area Council and Kunchigoro in Abuja Municipal Area Council chieftaincy tussles have been resolved. She also explained that the secretariat was not complacent in the issue of security of life and property in the various communities. On the prevalence of insecurity in some of the area councils, she revealed that the secretariat was working with security agencies and other stakeholders to end the cases of kidnapping in the area councils.

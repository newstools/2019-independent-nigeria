Makurdi  – Operation Whirl Stroke (OPWS), the military spike operation in Benue, Nasarawa and Taraba States engaged a gang of bandits terrorising the people of Abako community in Katsina-Ala Local Government Area (LGA) of Benue State in an exchange of gun fire last Wednesday.
While the troops were able to subdue the bandits, it also recovered from the robbers a stolen vehicle and N150,000 cash.
Commander OPWS, Major General Adeyemi Yekini disclosed this while speaking with Saturday INDEPENDENT in Makurdi on Friday.
Narrating the incident to our Correspondent, the OPWS Commander said, “We received information that armed robbers invaded Abako town in Katsina Ala LGA of Benue State, near Takum, Taraba State and robbed some people including traders.
“We went after the robbers and after a heavy gun battle, we overpowered the criminals, apprehended some of them and in the process recovered a vehicle they stole from one of their victims.
“We also recovered from them N150,000 cash with other dangerous weapons.
“One of them sustained gunshot wounds and we have handed them over to the police authorities for further action including the items recovered from them.”
On insinuations that innocent persons were arrested, Gen Yekini said, “It was a case of armed robbery, not unnecessary arrests of people of Abakor community as being speculated in some quarters. We have no problems with peace loving and innocent individuals who are not into crime,” he stated.
General Yekini also pointed out that the robbers upon sighting the troops, opened fire on his men who responded, resulting in the arrest and recovery of cash and a stolen vehicle.

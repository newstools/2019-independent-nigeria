LAGOS – Christian Chukwu, former Rangers boss has downplayed the present crisis bedeviling the fortunes of the club saying reorganisation is on-going to stabilise the team. The ‘Flying Antelopes’ started the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) on very poor note winning one match and drawn one; lost three to garner four points out of possible 15 points for the five matches played so far. They have scored three goals and conceded six, to maintain 18th position on the able. On the continental campaign where Rangers and Enyimba of Aba are representing Nigeria, the Enugu side dampened the hopes anything good in the offing when they were humiliated 1-3 by Pyramids of Egypt at the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium, Enugu on Sunday December 1. All of these, Chukwu said would be remedied in good time to return the team to its pride of place in the top flight. “We are not happy with the present development in the team; but I can tell you that the team right now is undergoing a process of reorganisation to put things in good shape. “But the reorganisation has nothing to do with management of the team – the management is intact. We are looking at overhauling the squad; there are some players that have no business in the team; there’s need to bring in quality and committed players,” he affirmed. Invariably, he opined that the Confederation Cup humiliation has no effect on the quality and confidence the club has on the newly appointed coach, Salisu Yusuf, who was in charge of the game. “It is good that these problems surfaced at this early stage; management will have enough time to fix them now for the team to bounce back in good time. Yusuf, will need time to stabiilse the team, but he has no blame in the Sunday defeat,” said Chukwu.

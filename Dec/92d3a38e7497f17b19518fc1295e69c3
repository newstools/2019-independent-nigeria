Despite the agreement on the payment of N30,000 minimum wage in 2020, some Nigerian states have depleted their 2020 budgets. The federal government and labour had on October 18 announced an agreement on the implementation of the new wage. The agreement over consequential adjustments averted a strike action that labour had threatened to call should government further delay the new minimum wage take-off. Under the agreement, workers on salary Grade Level 07 received 23.2 per cent pay rise; those on GL 08, 20 per cent; and GL 09 got 19 per cent. Officers on GLs 10 to 14 got 16 per cent hike and those on levels 15 to 17 got 14 per cent upward review. Together with the consolidated salary structures of universities, polytechnics and colleges of education, the federal monthly wage bill currently stands at N611 billion.

An analysis by Daily Trust shows that 20 states have depleted their 2020 budget estimates by N733 billion which amounts to 16 percent decrease whereas 17 states increased their estimates for 2020 by N855 billion which translates to 19.9 percent increase. According to the data generated by Daily Trust, the 36 states and FCT cumulative budgets for 2020 have remained largely the same, with the 36 states and the FCT budgeting a total of N9.331 trillion for 2020, slightly short of the total of N9.330 trillion budgeted in 2019. The 2020 budgets’ total however does not capture any figure for Bayelsa State following the recently concluded governorship election and a handover slated for February 2020. The Commissioner for Information and Orientation in the state, Daniel Iworiso-Markson, explained that the 2019 budget would run till the end of Dickson’s tenure – February 14, 2020. The 20 states that reduced their estimates in line with the prevailing economic realities are: Abia (N141-N136bn), Adamawa(N224-N183bn), Akwa Ibom (N673-598bn), Anambra (N157-N137bn), Bauchi (N199-N167bn), Benue (N200-189bn), Borno (N145-N144bn), Delta (N390-N389bn), Edo (N184-N179bn), Imo (N251-N197bn), Ekiti (N130-N125bn), Niger (N195-N148bn), Jigawa (N160-N153bn), Oyo (N285-N213bn), Ondo (N194-N138bn), Kebbi (N151-N138bn), FCT (N243-N232bn), Kano (N220-197), Nasarawa (N191-100bn) and Ebonyi (N188-N178bn) The 15 states that increased their estimates are: Cross Rivers (N1trn- N1.1trn), Enugu (N109-N170bn), Kogi (N147-N176bn), Kwara (N158-N162), Lagos (N874Bn-N1.1trn), Gombe (N122-N131bn), Plateau (N154-N172bn), Rivers (N480-N530bn), Sokoto (N170-202), Taraba (N146-N213bn), Yobe (N92-N108bn), Zamfara (N135-N182bn), Kaduna (N157-N259bn), Katsina (N202-N249bn), Ogun (N400-N449bn) and Osun (N154-N199bn). The Daily Trust findings also revealed that barely 48 hours to the expiration of the December 31, 2019 deadline issued by the NLC to states to complete all negotiations regarding how much they will pay their workers, only Lagos, Kaduna and Kebbi have presented their minimum wage offers. While about six state governments are currently negotiating with their respective state chapters of the Nigeria Labour Congress, over 20 others are yet to begin negotiations with the labour union.

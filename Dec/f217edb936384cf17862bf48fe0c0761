Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami, the Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, has mandated the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) to adhere strictly to the provisions of the Executive Orders 003 and 005 as contained in the presidential directives of May 1, 2017 and February 12, 2018 respectively, in awarding contracts in the sector. The minister’s latest directive came as a response to issues raised by stakeholders, drawing his attention to the non-compliance of the sector regulator with the policy, as a result of which indigenous companies in the sector have continued to be sidelined. The Executive Orders 003 of 2017 and 005 of 2018 were specifically enacted to give impetus to the Local Content Development and Promotion drive of President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration as the telecommunications sub-sector is one of the most important.

A 26-year-old security guard, Muraina Ridwan, was, on Friday in Lagos, arraigned before an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court for allegedly absconding with his employer’s N2.5 million valuables.
Ridwan, who lives with his employer in Magodo, Lagos, is being tried for stealing, an offence he, however, denied committing.
The Police Prosecutor, Insp. Adegoke Philip, told the court that the defendant committed the offence in March at his residence.
He said that the defendant bolted away with N2.5 million valuables belonging to Mr Anthony Omotosho and his family.
“The defendant stole cash, different phones and jewellery,” the prosecutor told the court.
He said that the defendant burgled the complainant’s apartment when he travelled and carted away his property.
“He ran away with the complainant’s belongings to an unknown destination. Nine months after, he was arrested, but he had sold off all the valuables,” Philip said.
According to him, the offence contravenes Section 287 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015, which carries three years imprisonment for stealing.
The Magistrate, Mrs O. A. Akokhia, admitted the defendant to a bail of N400,000, with two sureties in like sum.
Akokhia said that the sureties must be gainfully employed and show evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State Government.
She, thereafter, adjourned the case till Jan. 17, 2020.

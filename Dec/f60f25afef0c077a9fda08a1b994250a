Sudan’s former ruling National Congress Party (NCP) has lashed out after the new sovereign council announced it had passed a law banning the party of ex-president Omar al Batshit and repealed misogynistic legislation banning women from attending parties or wearing trousers. “The party is not bothered by any law or decision issued against it as the NCP is a strong party and its ideas will prevail,” the party said on its Facebook page, saying the new “illegal government” had taken a reckless decision. The move will also see the NCP’s assets seized and the regime dismantled, part of the demands made by the protest movement when forming the new power-sharing government. Additionally, no NCP actors will be allowed to hold political office for 10 years – a move aimed at ensuring a definitive end to the 30-year regime. Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok said the measures should not be seen as an act of revenge. “It aims to preserve the dignity of Sudanese people which was crushed by dishonest people,” he wrote on Twitter. “This law aims to recover the plundered wealth of the people.”

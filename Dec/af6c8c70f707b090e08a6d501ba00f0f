Comrade Ayuba Wabba,President of Nigerian Labour Congress(NLC),has raised alarm over plans by the management of First Bank of Nigeria Plc to retrench over one thousand workers in its employ without adequate and commensurate severance benefits. The labour movement conveyed this in a letter to the managing director of the bank wherein it also disclosed that the management of First Bank of Nigeria PLC has refused to enter into dialogue with the National Union of Banks, Insurance and Financial Institutions Employees (NUBIFIE), which is the workers’ representative trade union organization. ‘’This is also in contravention to Section 20 of Nigeria’s Labour Act and Convention 98 of the International Labour Organization (ILO) on the right to Organizing and Collective Bargaining which Nigeria had long ratified. ‘’Finally, we wish to remind the management of First Bank of Nigeria Plc that workers are not commodities to be used and tossed aside at will. In addition to declaring humungous profits to its shareholders annually, First Bank of Nigeria PLC has a higher moral responsibility to the welfare of its workers as they are the ones who create the profit and wealth that the shareholders enjoy. We believe that it must be people before profit’’ The union emphasized the need for immediate suspension of the plans to retrench over one thousand workers in the employment of First Bank Nigeria PLC.

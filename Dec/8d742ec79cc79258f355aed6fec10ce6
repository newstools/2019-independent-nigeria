LAGOS – After two defeats at home and away in the on-going CAF Confederation Cup campaign it is a fact that Rangers International may have lost the confidence and support of their fans. The Enugu side lost 2-4 to Al Masry of Egypt last Sunday in Alexandria in their second Group A game, just as they lost 1-3 in first encounter at the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium, Enugu on December 1 to another Egyptian side, Pyramids. Christian Chukwu (MON), a former Rangers boss and Captain, who admitted all is not well with the team has called on the club’s fans and other stakeholders not to relent in their supports while the transitional period lasts. “I know nobody can be happy about the performance of Rangers for now; they have lost two matches home and away in the CAF campaign; that is not a good result at all.

Ughelli – Member representing Ethiope East and Ethiope West Constituency in the House of Representatives, Ben Igbakpa, has described the Delta Central Senatorial candidate of the PDP in the last election, Evelyn Omavowan Oboro, as a politician whose achievements would always speak for in future elections. Igbakpa, who said this in a chat during a ceremony in Effurun, Uvwie Local Government Area of Delta State, said Oboro is a politician loved by her constituents because of her massive empowerment for constituents and projects she brought to her constituency during her eight-year spell at the National Assembly. Igbakpa stated that the recent thanksgiving of Oboro was in appreciation to God, adding that whichever way things go, it was good to give thanks to God. He noted that despite the travails that she went through, she was able to return thanks to God. “She is an Amazon, who performed creditably well in her previous assignment. We all know the gang-up and all that happened during the election, but she is alive and hopeful for tomorrow and there is every need for her to thank God believing that tomorrow will be better,” he said. On his plans for his constituents, Igbakpa said he has rolled out his plans and what he intended to do for his people. “We have distributed forms to the first set of beneficiaries, five per ward and another two per ward making it a total of 154 in our first phase of empowerment. We have done it before and we are very ready to do more, he added.

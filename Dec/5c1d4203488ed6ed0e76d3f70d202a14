In its committed drive to capture and dominate the Nigerian mobile phone market in the nearest future, Zzapo Ltd the latest smartphone manufacturer has introduced a product called Zzapo Phone. Not only is the android competitive in terms of features, apps and beauty, but the manufacturers have also deliberately made the price too low to be resisted by any prospective mobile phone user. According to Mr. Rakesh Upadhyay, Zzapo Company, after a thorough market survey, realised that there is a great demand for smartphone in the African continental market but unfortunately, most of the available phones are rather too expensive for the economic power of the majority; a factor that has resulted in very low patronage from the masses. “With the backing of a strong research and development team and after four years of continuous development, Zzapo mobile is set to launch the most affordable smartphone of this era in Nigeria. “Zzapo mobile is the first mobile in the world to have a 720-degree camera that can pick a 360-degree vertical and horizontal Panoramic high definition image at the same time.

India’s financial regulator predicted that an improvement in banks’ bad-loan ratios will reverse, as a slowing economy hurts borrowers’ ability to repay. In its latest Financial Stability Report released Friday, the Reserve Bank of India said soured debt at Indian lenders will rise to 9.9% of total credit by September 2020, after dropping the most in 15 years to 9.3% a year earlier. It had previously forecast at 9% in March. “This is primarily due to change in macroeconomic scenario, the marginal increase in slippages and the denominator effect of declining credit growth,” the RBI said.

Gross bad loans at shadow banks also increased to 6.3% in September from 6.1% in March. The RBI’s assessment contrasts with warnings from Moody’s Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings, which see rising risks of contagion in the Indian financial sector amid a persisting cash crunch. The credit quality of Indian companies has plummeted to a record as Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government struggles to revive economic growth from a six-year-low. More than a year after a series of defaults by Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd. forced the government to intervene and exposed weaknesses in the nation’s shadow banks, the sector is entering a new phase. In November, the RBI seized control of Dewan Housing Finance Corp., another troubled shadow lender, and said it would initiate bankruptcy proceedings against the firm.

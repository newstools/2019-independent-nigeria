No fewer than 53,674 teachers who wrote the December Diet of the Teachers’ Professional Qualifying Examination (PQE) have qualified to register for teaching licences.
Prof. Josiah Ajiboye, Registrar, Teachers’ Registration Council of Nigeria (TRCN), disclosed this in Abuja on in an interview with newsmen.
The examination, which was conducted in 47 centres across the country, started on December 5 in states with large number of candidates, and ended on December 7.
Ajiboye said the results had been approved by the Governing Council of TRCN, adding that 72,947 out of 77,296 teachers that registered participated in the examination.
“The result was not bad because the average performance of those who passed the examination is 73.58 per cent, which is 53,674 candidates, while 26.42 per cent, representing 19,273 candidates, failed.
“The performances of the candidates are very encouraging; the Federal Ministry of Education and TRCN Governing Board are happy with it,” he said.
He said though PQE was not an achievement test, it was important to ensure that an individual registered as a professional teacher.
Ajiboye explained that the council would not issue teaching certificate and licence to any teacher without writing the examination.
“The deadline of December 31 is still certain, but it does not mean the PQE has stopped. It has come to stay.
“We are planning to be organising the exams for teachers on quarterly basis to help more teachers to enrol, instead of writing twice in a year.
“We must have committed and qualified teachers; we also want to ensure that the teaching environment is in order,” he said.

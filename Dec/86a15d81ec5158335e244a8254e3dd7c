Barcelona striker, Luis Suarez has been fading away gradually. Age seems to have him in a stronghold and that is visible in his waning speed and consistency. Suarez is well aware of the fact that he needs to be replaced eventually. As much as one would hate to admit it, Barcelona do need to look for long-term prospects to fill in Luis Suarez’s shoes and that is precisely what they’re doing. As per Everything Barca via UK Mirror, Suarez has identified his successor in Chelsea’s Tammy Abraham who has been in the sensational form of late. In fact, Suarez admitted in public that he’s a fan of Tammy and the way he goes about his duties as a forward. Suarez also identified potential targets in Inter Milan Ace Lautaro Martinez and his Uruguayan compatriot in Maxi Gomez. Speaking about Maxi, Suarez acclaimed that Gomez’s attributes and mentality is what any club requires and he would be a perfect fit for CF role. Suarez is well aware of the fact that he isn’t the player he used to be a few years ago and that he needs to step aside in the near future. It is really heartbreaking for any fan to see a loyal servant of the club nearing his gradual end. Luis Suarez’s pace and form have been a concern for Barcelona in recent times. There is no doubt about the quality that Suarez brings to the table but every certain thing has an end. As per certain reports, Harry Kane is also on the watchlist of the Blaugranes and he has been on it, for a while now.

New Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta is already making plans to strengthen his squad, and The Athletic claims the Spaniard is keeping tabs on Lille defender Gabriel, according to Espn.co.uk reports. The Gunners look set to be priced out of a move for Napoli defender Kalidou Koulibaly, with Arteta being told by the Arsenal hierarchy that there would be limited funds to spend in the new year following extensive spending in the summer. Brazilian Gabriel is seen as a cut-price alternative to Koulibaly — the 22-year-old has impressed in his 23 appearances for Lille this season, including six outings in the Champions League, but his potential involvement in an Olympic pre-qualifying tournament next month with the Brazil under-23 side could scupper a January raid. The former Dinamo Zagreb loanee’s contract in Ligue 1 expires in 18 months, which means Arsenal could be in a position to drive a hard bargain next month.

LAGOS – Chief Sunny Onuesoke, a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has appealed to the Federal Government to urgently fix Nigeria’s moribund refineries so as to create jobs for the teeming youths in the country. He made the statement on Tuesday in reaction to the statement of Nigeria’s Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs Zainab Ahmed, on the eagerness of the President Muhammadu Buhari administration for the Dangote Refinery to commence operation. The Minister had explained that the take off of Dangote Refinery would save the country over $10 billion spent on importation of petrol and create jobs. She stated that the Federal Government would offer some tax waivers to the company Onuesoke, who said he was not against the Federal Government’s support for Dangote Refinery, however, argued that it would have been better for the Federal Government to revitalise the country’s four ailing refineries so that the nation would gain from the input of their production.

ABUJA â€“ The Board Chairman of Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Senator Durojaiye Olabiyi, has revealed that NCC would soon embark on the laying of fibre optic cables in State capitals and 774 Local Government Areas in Nigeria as part of measures to deepen broadband penetration in the country. Olaniyi stated this in an interview with newsmen at the weekend in Abuja during the Annual Thanksgiving and Carol Service organised by NCC Christian Staff Fellowship. He said President Muhammadu Buhari and Minister of Communications have given approval to the initiative. As of September, 2019, Nigeria had achieved 35.40 per cent broadband penetration. Olabiyi therefore, tasked NCC staff to be transparent, diligent, discreet and discipline in the discharge of their duties. The NCC Board Chairman maintained that Nigeria would be one of the best countries in the world when every Nigerian embraces hard work, integrity and discipline in all their dealings. As part of new initiative, Olabiyi said NCC was in the process of identifying brilliant and gifted people in the ICT sector for them to be trained and empowered by the Commission. He noted that Nigeria had made giant strides in the Information and Communication Technology over the years, noting that Nigeria was the first country in Africa to commence 5G network, following its launch by MTN Nigeria recently in Abuja. Also speaking, Pastor Yakubu Gontor, President of NCC Christian Staff Fellowship, thanked God profusely for His faithfulness to the Commission. Gontor said the fellowship members were champions of integrity in the Commission, adding that the fellowship has been emphasising on diligence, integrity, righteousness and prayer for the good of the Commission and the country in general. As part of activities to celebrate annual thanksgiving and carol service, various Christian music, Bible Reading and Christmas Carols renditions were offered to God for His faithfulness.

A small tornado, referred to as puting beliung in Indonesian, damaged dozens of houses in Bali’s Jembrana regency yesterday. “Two communities were affected by the strong wind. The most damage occurred in Brawantangi,” Made Budi Utama, chief of Tukadaya village where the disaster occurred, told state news agency Antara today. Roofs of the houses in Tukadaya were damaged because of the tornado, though thankfully no one was injured.

We advise people to remain alert, because these natural disasters, including strong wind, often happen as we enter the rainy season,” I Ketut Eko Susilo, who heads the Regional Disaster Management Agency (BPBD) in Jembrana, said. BPBD, along with the local police in Jembrana, reportedly assisted residents in Tukadaya earlier today to fix some of the damage and cleaned up the mess in the area.

LAGOS – Ahead of January, 2020’s African draws for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, Alloy Agu, the Super Eagles goalkeeper trainer, has said that the national team would be ready to face any opposition in order to scale the second round of the qualifiers for the final phase. Recall that Nigeria will be joining 39 other African countries in the second round (group stage) draws which has been scheduled for the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Cairo, Egypt on Tuesday, January 21, 2020. The second round of the qualifiers will kick off in March 2020 and will be concluded in October 2021. Group winners will advance to the third round which is scheduled for November 2021. The 10 group winners from Round 2 will be paired up for knockout matches, with the five winners securing a berth at Qatar 2022. Speaking to DAILY INDEPENDENT on the prospect of the national team ahead of the draws, Agu, a former goalie of the team, said the three-time African champions would be ready for any opposition, even as he said that at this stage, no country would be a pushover. “Just like other countries, we are looking forward to the draws with keen interest to see who will be playing. “But no matter which country will face us, we are ready for the qualifiers. We cannot be afraid of any team at this time or say we don’t want this or that team; no. We look forward for the draws and we are ready to play any country,” he said. The Super Eagles have featured in each of the last three World Cup tournaments and will be bidding to make it four in a row for the first time ever and seventh overall in Qatar in 2022.

NNEWI – Nonso Smart Okafor, a member representing Nnewi North Constituency in the Anambra State House of Assembly, has urged Nigerians to be united in order to move Nigeria forward.
Okafor, who stated this in an interview with DAILY INDEPENDENT in Nnewi on Monday, urged politicians who lost in the last elections to sink their differences and join hands with elected representatives to move the country forward.
He said in the face of present challenges threatening the country, Nigerians needed to be united more than ever before and to be supportive of the government in power to be able to realize economic and developmental objectives for the people.
On his victory at the Appeal Court, Okafor called on his opponents to join hands with him to actualise his election promise which he summarized as quality representation to Nnewi North Constituency and the state.
He described his victory as victory for all Anambra people and his three months trial at the court as period of distraction, saying he now has the opportunity to think and plan better for the state.
“This is a time Nigerians need to be united and support the government in power to overcome the challenges facing us as a nation and develop the country, and move forward.
“On my victory, it is a victory for all. It is a new beginning. It is an opportunity to plan and think better and be able to take our representation to the next level.
“After the court distraction so far we can only think for the better. Anambra is light of the nation. For being light of the Nation, people in the state should be able to exude that light,” Okafor said.

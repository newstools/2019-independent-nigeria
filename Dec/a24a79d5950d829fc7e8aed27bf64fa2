BENIN – Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), University of Benin (UNIBEN) chapter, has maintained its unequivocal rejection of Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS) and vowed that no amount of threat or blackmail would sway its resolve. It made the vow in support of the decision taken at the end of the National Executive Council (NEC) meeting held last week. The UNIBEN ASUU stated that it was appalled “by the continuing charade of the office Accountant General of the Federation aimed at forcibly implementing IPPIS in Nigeria federal universities. “We have equally come to the conclusion that it is the federal government’s ploy to renege on its agreement with our union in furtherance of its intent on abdicating its duty and responsibility to adequately fund education in Nigeria. “In particular, we note that government is scheming to abandon the long overdue renegotiation of the ASUU-FGN 2009 Agreement and also avoid fully honouring the February 2019 Memorandum of Action (MoA) it freely signed with ASUU. “And, for the umpteenth time, we restate our unequivocal rejection of IPPIS and vow that no amount of threat or blackmail will sway our resolve.” Based on this, UNIBEN ASUU resolved that its position that members should not enroll into IPPIS stands and is reaffirmed by the Congress. Also, it unanimously aligned itself with the NEC declaration to call out its members on a nationwide strike if any member of the union is victimised for refusal to enroll into the IPPIS platform in the spirit of ‘an injury to one is an injury to all.’

Lagos â€“ The Confederation of African Football (CAF), on Sunday, pruned down the list of final contestants for various categories of its award scheduled for Cairo in January, with three Nigerians still holding sway in the race. In a release obtained from CAF online portal, the duo of Samuel Chukwueze Spanish side, Villarreal, alongside his compatriot, Victor Osimhen of French club, Lille, are among the three-man shortlist for the African Youth Player of the Year category. They will slug it out with Achraf Hakimi of Morocco and Borussia Dortmund. In the African Women Player of the Year category, Asisat Oshoala of FC Barcelona will have Ajara Nchout of Cameroon and Valerenga of Norway, as well as Thembi Kgatlana of South Africa and Chinese women Super League side, Beijing Phoenix FC, to contend with. Meanwhile, in the main African Footballer of the year category, the three-man shortlist are expectedly Mohamed Salah of Liverpool and Egypt and his club mate and Senegalese hit man, Sadio Mane. They will vie for the biggest individual honour with Manchester City and Algerian international, Riyad Mahrez. Odion Ighalo, who was the only Nigerian standing among the trio was removed from the final three gladiators, even as Nigeria will have to wait longer to win the award, which the country dominated in the 1990s. The last time Nigeria won the award was in 1999, as Nwankwo Kanu won it that year for his second after he emerged the winner in 1996. Rashidi Yekini was the first Nigerian to win the award in 1993 and was followed in 1996 by Kanu before Victor Ikpeba won it in 1997. However, the duo of Henry Nwosu and Mutiu Adepoju has tipped either Chukwueze or Osimhen to clinch the young player award. Both former internationals, who spoke to DAILY INDEPENDENT in separate chats, said that it would be surprising if either of the two Nigerians failed to win the awards, while also saying that Oshoala stood a big chance to win in her category.

Contrary to expectations that prices of food items would soar further owing to Christmas celebrations, the situation appeared not to be so as visits to some markets in the week under review showed that prices of food items such as beans, garri and palm oil did not witness a sharp increase in price from what obtained in previous weeks. That of local rice which have been on steady increase since the ban on importation of foreign rice coupled with the closure of surrounding land borders by the Federal Government have not been favourable to consumers either. The situation, however, resulted to low demand despite being a season of celebrations as consumers, especially the common folks, had to reduce their purchases owing to the exorbitant prices at which they were sold. Many of the traders also, seemed to be affected adversely as they complained of poor sales after investing huge amount of money to up their procurements since the Christmas celebrations is in a week’s time. With the unfriendly rate of inflation having a negative consequence on the high cost of living, survival has become a big struggle to many and this seemed to have affected patronage unfavorably as consumers had to make do of what they could afford in this season of merriment. During the week, findings from a market survey across some states by the Business and Market Intelligence Unit of SUNDAY INDEPENDENT revealed that prices of food items were still on the high side of which many of the traders majorly blamed on continued closure of land borders, resulting to shortfall in supply. Visits to Ughelli Market, Delta State, indicated that prices of food items still remained high; For example, prices of a 50kg bag of local rice currently range from N21, 500 to N23, 000 up from N22, 000 earlier sold while that of a 100kg bag of brown beans still went for between N23,000 and N25,000 depending on the specie and bargaining power of the customer. Prices of white & yellow garri increased slightly to between N5, 000 and N5, 300 from between N4, 500 and N4, 800 initially sold. That of fresh tomatoes reduced sharply to between N10,000 and N12,000 as against N18,000 previously sold  while fresh pepper was still on the high side,  attracting   between N17,000 and N17,500  within the review week. Mrs. Aina Onuigbo, who trades in all kinds of grains at the Ughelli Market, blamed the situation to scarcity of the commodity, but that of fresh tomatoes recorded improved supply. The same could be said for that of Umuahia main Market, Abia State,  especially with prices of a 50kg bag of local rice currently going for between N21,000 and N22,000 against N20,000 previously sold while that of a bag of brown beans still remained at between N20,000 and N23,000 depending on the specie. That of fresh tomatoes however, witnessed a decline owing to increased supply usually associated with its season of plenty. For instance, a basket of fresh tomatoes currently sells for between N10, 000 and N11, 600 down from N18, 000 earlier sold. At the Dawanau and Garko Market, Kano, prices of food items such as local rice soared further with a 50kg bag currently ranging from N17,000 to N17,500 up from N16,500 sold before. Many of the traders connected the situation to limited supply due to increased demand. That of brown beans still remained stable at between N17, 000 and 19,000 depending on the category and the haggling power of the buyer. Prices of basket of fresh tomatoes were at a declining trend, currently selling for between N5, 800 and N6,500 down from N12,000 previously sold. Likewise, prices of white garri currently go for between N13,500 and N14,000 owing to unavailability and high cost of logistic in conveying the commodity from the South. At the Lafenwa Market, Ogun State, prices of both local and foreign rice were exorbitant especially with a 50kg bag of local rice currently ranging from N17,000 to  N18,500 while that of  foreign  rice, despite proximity to the border went for between N20,000 and N22,000 as at December 19, 2019. Prices of a 100kg bag of brown beans were still at a sliding trend, selling for between N18,000 and N20,000 but this depends on the size of the bag and the negotiating power of the buyer. That  of a basket of fresh tomatoes fell within the region of N7,000 and N8,000 as against N13,000 formerly sold while  fresh pepper was however, still on the high side, with a bag going for between N15,000 and N16,000 against N14,000 sold formerly. Many of the traders at the Lafenwa Market, Ogun State, linked the situation to closure of surrounding borders and lack of purchasing power. For Bodija Market, Ibadan, the trend was not at variance with other locations as prices of staple food items especially rice which is mostly patronised during festive season. For example, prices of a 50kg bag of local rice still remained at between N19,000 and N20,000 while that of brown beans attracted between N19,000 and N20,000 up from 18,000 earlier sold. Prices of a basket of fresh tomatoes dropped to between N7,000 and N8,000 from N15,000 previously sold . Fresh pepper prices are still high as a bag currently sells within the region of N15,000 and N16,000. Alhaji Aremu, who trades in the commodity at the Bodija Market, Ibadan, attributed the reduction in prices of fresh tomatoes to improved supply but for other commodities such as rice, was attributed to scarcity. In Lagos, checks at popular markets such as Mile 12, Daleko and Ogba revealed that patronage level for staple food such as rice was very low due to the unfavorable price it was  being sold. For instance, prices of  a 50kg bag local rice in Lagos, ranged from N16,500 to  N22,000 while foreign rice went for between N24,000 and N28,000, depending on the market, brand and bargaining power of the buyer. That of brown beans stay put at between N18,000 and N20,000 depending on the market. Prices of fresh tomatoes witnessed a downward trend, currently ranging from N6,500 to N8,000 down from between N17,000 and N18,000 formerly sold. That of a bag of fresh pepper still remained high at N16,000, a situation which many of the traders linked to scarcity. That of the white & yellow garri prices attracted between N6,000 and N6,800 up from N5,000 previously sold.

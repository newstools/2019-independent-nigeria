ABUJA – Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, has challenged All Progressives Congress (APC) led- government to practise what it preaches to the citizenry. Wike who gave this charge on Tuesday in Abuja at the book presentation written by Eric Osagie, former Managing Director/ Editor-in-Chief of The Sun Publishing Limited, chided APC led Federal Government for failing to ensure the conduct of free, fair and credible elections in 2019. While responding to the speech made by National Chairman of APC, Adams Oshiomhole, that political leaders should practise what they preach in the public, Wike reminded Oshiomhole on how he (Oshiomhole)came to the Presidential Villa to thank former President Goodluck Jonathan for ensuring one man, one vote in Nigeria, during the 2015 elections. He lamented that though APC led government gave the same promise in 2019 elections of ensuring free and fair elections, but failed woefully to match their words with action. Wike decried further the indiscriminate arrest of critics of the government and those with dissenting voices, adding that rule of law and obedience to court orders has been trampled upon by the present administration. He pointed out that Nigeria is not making headway in every sphere, noting that the country is retrogressing. Wike, who was the chief presenter of the book, called on journalists to be dogged and courageous in the discharge of their duties and always stand for the truth. The governor urged journalists to desist from “packaging politicians” in their reportage, adding that truth should be their guiding principle in the discharge of their duties.

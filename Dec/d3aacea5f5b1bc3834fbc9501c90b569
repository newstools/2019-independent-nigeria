ABUJA – Not less than 80 persons were convicted for various traffic offences, ranging from bad driving, use of rickety or road unworthy vehicles to lack of safety equipment such as fire extinguisher and accident signs, to mention but a few. Speaking to newsmen over the weekend during the commencement of sitting for the mobile court at the head office of the Directorate of Road Traffic Services (VIO) in Mabushi, Abuja, the Head of Public Relations, Kalu Emetu, said the court was set up by the FCT Administration to decide the fate of traffic offenders recently arrested by VIO in Abuja. Emetu stressed, “There are standards that must be kept by all vehicle owners in the FCT, but those arrested who are being tried were found wanting. “We are a law-abiding, that was why we decided to involve the magistrate court to look into the legal issues and whatever is the judgement, we will accept and implement accordingly. “Some of them will need to pay certain fines to serve as a deterrent to others, while others will have to fix their vehicles as the case may be. “As a modern city, Abuja must be governed by laws and order, so that is what we are doing now,” he stressed. According to him, some of the impounded cars, tricycle and motorcycles that were not roadworthy would be ‘cannibalised’, that is dismembered or destroyed. The week-long mobile court sitting was simultaneously been held in three locations across the territory, including Area 1 and Utako. Some of the offenders who were tried said they were okay with the decision of government to restore law and order, even as others appealed for understanding from the government to assist them fix their vehicles or get something for themselves and families.

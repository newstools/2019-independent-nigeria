Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State on Friday gave assent to the state’s 2020 budget of N178.1 billion, warning that he is going to be hard on tax evaders. He explained that there will be no sacred cow in the state as far as collection of internally generated revenue (IGR) is concerned. He expressed worries as to why some people would pay taxes in other places like Abuja, Lagos, Enugu but would come to Ebonyi State and refuse to pay. He said that such would no longer be tolerated, noting that even the mangers of his own businesses would face prosecution if they failed to pay the requisite IGR. “I am ready to quarrel with anybody and Internal Revenue Board should use whatever legitimate measures to ensure compliance”, he stated. Umahi said that the budget cannot be implemented without accruals from IGR. “So, we will do everything possible to see that we succeed in this budget”. “There is so much that people are collecting but it is not remitted to government, we will not allow it to continue”, he added.

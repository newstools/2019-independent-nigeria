ABUJA – The Department of State Services (DSS), has on Friday exonerated its personnel from the shooting in Alor community, Anambra State that claimed the life of a native. In a statement sent to Saturday INDEPENDENT by Peter Afunanya, Public Relations Officer (PRO), of DSS National Headquarters, Abuja, the Service said; “It is not true that a DSS personnel was responsible for this act.” The statement reads in part; “Our attention has been drawn to a false story making the round that its staff, on 25th December, 2019, at Alor Community, Anambra State “while targeting a cow that was running away,” shot a native instead. “The Nation newspaper, among others, has carried this erroneous story. It is not true that a DSS personnel was responsible for this act. “The Police has further issued a statement informing the public that it was yet to conclude its investigation to determine the actual killer of the person in question. However, enquiries have indicated that a member of a vigilante group in the area carried out the shooting. “The public is therefore urged to discountenance the story that the DSS personnel shot anyone in the community.” He further explained that, arms handling in the Service is guided by strict control procedures and measures such that none of its staff could have used his or her assigned gun to shoot an innocent native or escaping cow. “The Service is professional and will remain so in the discharge of its duties. It is committed to the maintainance of peace and public safety across the country during and after the yuletide season.”

XAVIER NDAH,RAJI ADEBAYO LAGOS, IBADAN – Operatives of the Ibadan zonal office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on Wednesday busted a Lagos hotel believed to be a hideout for internet fraudsters. Wilson Uwujaren, Head, Media and Publicity, of the commission who confirmed the raid to DAILY INDEPENDENT Wednesday said  the target was one Rasaq Balogun,  a suspected internet fraud kingpin, whose illicit activities dominated intelligence gathered from the recently arrested ‘police spies’ during a raid on their Abeokuta base. According to findings, Balogun harbours an army of young men recruited to carry out financial frauds through the use of the Internet. Uwujaren said some others were also arrested at his Beckley Estate residence, also in Lagos State. The raid on his hotel, Modzak Hotel, at Abule-Egba, Lagos, sufficiently gave credence to the suspicion as a retinue of young men was caught in his hotel with no specific mission. The suspected kingpin and 26 other young men with ages ranging between 18 and 35 were arrested at the scene. Some others were also arrested at his Beckley Estate residence, also in Lagos. They were brought to the Commission’s Ibadan zonal office for further interrogation. Officers of the Anti-Graft agency also recovered three vehicles, fetish item, laptops, mobile phones and documents suspected to contain fraudulent data from the suspect. Uwujaren said those indicted will be charged to court as soon as investigations are concluded.

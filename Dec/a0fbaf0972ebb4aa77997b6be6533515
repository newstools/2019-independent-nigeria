The Dubai Police have recently honoured a bus driver for his honesty and good conduct as he returned a large sum of money forgotten by someone on the bus.
Abhishek Nad Gobindhan, a bus driver from RTA, found Dhs20,000 after passengers left the bus and handed it over to the Naif Police Station. Brigadier Dr. Tariq Mohammed Noor, Director of Naif Police Station, awarded the honest man with a certificate of thanks and appreciation for his good conduct and honesty, encouraging others to follow the same example. “Dubai Police are keen to strengthen the concept of community partnership with various segments of society,” Brig. Noor said.

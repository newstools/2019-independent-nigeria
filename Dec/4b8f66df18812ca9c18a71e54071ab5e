The Federal Government yesterday stated that it is studying the situation on change of West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA) currency, Eco, to be used as ECOWAS single currency. Mrs Zainab Ahmed, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, who made the disclosure in a statement by Yunusa Abdullahi, her Special Adviser, Media and Communication, in Abuja said Nigeria as a country would respond in due course. The Finance Minister specifically said: “To the news of the change of name of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA) currency, the Communate Financiere d’ Afrique (CFA) to Eco, supposedly as the ECOWAS single currency.” It would be recalled that President Alassane Ouattara, during a visit by French President Emmanuel Macron to Ivory Coast, stated that eight West African countries have agreed to change the name of their common currency to Eco, thereby effectively severing the CFA franc’s links to former colonial ruler France. The countries include Benin republic, Burkina Faso, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal and Togo. All of these African countries are former French colonies with the exception of Guinea-Bissau.

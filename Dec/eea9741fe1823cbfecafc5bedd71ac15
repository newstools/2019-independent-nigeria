Jeremy Corbyn has promised that Labour will be “the resistance” to Boris Johnson after presiding over his party’s worst general election result since 1935. The UK’s outgoing opposition leader used his New Year’s message to supporters to promise that Labour would continue to lead the fight against Johnson’s Conservative party, Business Insider reports. “It won’t be easy. But we have built a movement. We are the resistance to Boris Johnson,” Corbyn said in a recorded statement. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Corbyn acknowledges that 2019 had been “quite the year” for his party. However, he insisted that “The fight continues,” adding that “there is no other choice.” “We will be campaigning every day. We will be on the frontline, both in Parliament and on the streets,” he said. “Protecting our public services. Protecting healthcare free at the point of use. Protecting our communities, in all their brilliant diversity.” Corbyn’s statement drew derision from his many critics within the party. Labour MP Neil Coyle compared his statement to that of the hapless resistance leaders in the BBC sitcom Allo Allo, while one former senior Labour official compared him to the captain of the Titanic. Corbyn’s statement comes as his potential successors prepare to begin their official campaigns to replace him.

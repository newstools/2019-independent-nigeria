Akure – Adebayo Gbenga, an official of the West African Examinations Council (WAEC), and three others yet to be identified were on Monday reportedly kidnapped by gunmen at Oba-Akoko, along Owo/Akungba-Akoko Road, Akoko South Local Government Area of Ondo State. Sources revealed that Adebayo was abducted while taking his son to Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba-Akoko, over the weekend. He was said to have been crossed and forced to stop by some unknown gunmen with other vehicles on the road, but his friend who accompanied him escaped with his son, having quickly jumped out of the car and run into the bush. Adebayo, who was driving in a Toyota Corolla car, was abducted with three other persons from other vehicles and taken into the bush by the gunmen. A competent source close to Adebayo’s family disclosed that his abductors have called and demanded N20 million for his release. The source also revealed that Adebayo’s boss in WAEC office, Akure, was also contacted by the daredevil gunmen. They were said to have threatened to kill the victim if the ransom demanded was not paid as soon as possible. According to the source, the victim’s boss, colleagues, and family members were able to raise N1.2 million, but the abductors turned down the offer. He said the abductors rejected the WAEC officer’s plea that they could only raise N1.2 million, and have asked them to look for the rest before it was too late. Public Relations Officer of the state Police Command, Femi Joseph, a Superintendent of Police, confirmed the incident, noting that investigation had commenced on the incident immediately. He assured that the operatives of the formation would ensure the release of the captives safely while the abductors would be made to face the wrath of the law.

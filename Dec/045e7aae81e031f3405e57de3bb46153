Some traders in Abakpa Main Market, located in Ebonyi State capital, Abakiliki, appeared to be battle ready against the state government over directives to which Governor David Umahi urged the said traders to relocate to a new modern market built by the state. According to the Governor, the traders are expected to relocate to Saint Margaret Umahi International Market with effect from January 10th 2020, a situation that has not gone down well with a number of the traders. Some of the traders who spoke to Daily Independent said that the planned relocation is against their right of ownership of the land and shops for which reason some of them took the matter to court challenging the government on the issue. The situation has set the market leadership on tensed, just as traders, who are willing to obey the government relocation directives are set to comply. Chairman of the market, Mr. Peter Oba who seems to be working in line with the government directives explained that they were already allocating the shops at the International Market to the traders, noting that they have agreed to the relocation order by government He said that, “a few traders were opposed to the arrangement but that they were on their own because majority has accepted.” Mr. Kyrian Ofoke, Special Assistant to the Governor on Markets Development said that 29 traders earlier went to court challenging government but that 25 of them have withdrawn from the suit. Ofoke said that the state government engaged series of Town Hall meetings in that respect and that the relocation is in the overriding interest of the people in the state, including the traders.

In furtherance of the promise made by the Prince Dapo Abiodun-led government to ensure that criminals have no place to hide in the state, the state police command has introduced ‘Operation Restore Hope’ to neutralize all criminal hideouts in the state. The Ogun State Commissioner of Police, CP Kenneth Ebrimson made this known while answering questions from newsmen at the Governor’s Office, Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta, shortly after a closed-door meeting between the Police Management team in the State and the Governor. Ebrimson said his team had come to brief the Governor on measures being put in place by the command to fortify the state security architecture against criminal elements in the state. Ebrimson noted that ‘Operation Restore Hope’ would last for a period of two weeks. The period, he said, would be more than sufficient to comb all nooks and crannies of the state to smoke criminals out of their hide-outs and to recover arms and other stolen properties. “The exercise will last for two weeks. It will ensure that armed robbers, kidnappers, cultists have no place to operate during this yuletide season. It will also give the police the advantage of working ahead of the criminals by arresting them and simultaneously lead to the recovery of arms, stolen properties and anybody that will constitute a hindrance to the security architecture of the state will be rooted out,” he said

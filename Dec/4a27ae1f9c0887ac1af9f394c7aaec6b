LAGOS/ABUJA – President Muhammadu Buhari has thumbed up World Heavyweight Boxing Champion, Anthony Joshua, for regaining his belts Saturday night in a rematch with Mexican, Andy Ruiz Jnr. The president rejoiced with Joshua, saluting him for bringing joy to millions of Nigerians at home and in the Diaspora, who had rooted for him to regain the titles he lost about six months ago. “The downfall of a man is truly not the end of his life. There’s always another, and better day. This is a lesson we must all learn from you as a country,” President Buhari tells the comeback world champion. The President in a new terse statement by his media aide, Femi Adesina, wished Joshua well as he seeks to bring more glory to Nigeria, and to the boxing profession. Meanwhile, some Nigerian legends have also joined other fans of Joshua around the world to celebrate the victory of the Nigerian born British boxer over his win over Mexican, Ruiz, in Saudi Arabia on Saturday. Legends Nwankwo Kanu, Yakubu Aiyegbeni, Sunday Oliseh, and Mutiu Adepoju have joined fans across the world to celebrate Anthony Joshua after he reclaimed the heavyweight titles in Saudi Arabia. It was a memorable night for Joshua in Riyadh as he joins Floyd Patterson and Muhammad Ali in an exclusive list of two-time heavyweight champions. The victory delighted the Nigeria internationals while Super Eagles captain Ahmed Musa, who plies his trade at Saudi Arabian top-flight side Al Nassr, took time off to cheer Joshua, who was born to Nigerian parents in Watford, to victory. Sunday Oliseh twitted: “So relieved and pleased to see our Nigerian pride Anthony Joshua regain his title as World Heavyweight champion, defeating Ruiz.

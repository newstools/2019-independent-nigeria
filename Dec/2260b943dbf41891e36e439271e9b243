LAGOS – Former Super Eagles’ Assistant Coach and goalkeeper trainer, Joe Erico, has taken a swipe at the team’s current handler, Gernot Rohr for concluding that home-based players were not good enough to play for the Nigerian national team. In contrast with Rohr’s repeated verdict that only foreign-based stars deserve invitations to the Super Eagles, Erico fired back in disagreement and stressed that he cannot accept that players plying their trade in the Nigerian Professional Football League (NPFL) were not good enough. In a Radio Sports programme monitored in Lagos on Thursday, the former national team player added that the current situation of ignoring home-based players was counter-productive, as it would limit completion for shirts in the team, create stunted growth in the league and stall discovery of new talents from the domestic scene. “I know that there are quality players in the Nigerian league. In our days, we used players from the domestic league. “Some of them were even part of the team that won the Africa Nations Cup (AFCON) in 2013. They just need to get the right support and encouragement; then they will produce what those abroad are doing, even better. “As for anyone who thinks otherwise, I say … don’t give me that. A reasonable coach should be able to try as much as possible to infuse the home-based players to encourage them to work harder and to do more and giving them an opportunity. “I think it’s very important the coach should look inwards too for the success of the team and the game of football in the country in general,” Erico said.

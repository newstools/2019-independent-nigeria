Bayer Leverkusen will host Juventus in a must win game to have any chance of qualifying for the knockout rounds. There is good and bad news here for the home side. The good news is that they are facing Juventus who have already qualified and should put out a weakened side. The bad news is that the team in second place Atletico Madrid are at home to Lokomotiv Moscow, the weakest side in the group and if Atletico as expected do win then it doesn’t matter what Leverkusen do on Wednesday night. Still Leverkusen will go out to win and the BayArena will be full and the atmosphere great. It won’t be a surprise to see Leverkusen be the favourite especially given Juventus have already qualified. Leverkusen have beaten Atletico Madrid at home, but they surprisingly lost to Lokomotiv which is Lokomotiv’s only win in the group. That defeat is what has put Leverkusen in this edgy position. Juventus are in 1st place with 13 points and are six points clear off Atletico. Surely coach Maurizio Sarri will put out a mostly second-string team for this match which is a dead rubber game for the Italians. Juventus did lose for the first time in Serie A at the weekend going down 3-1 to Lazio. Away in Europe Juventus have beaten Lokomotiv in a close game that ended 2-1 and drew 2-2 against Atletico. Bayer Leverkusen are a great price to win this game and it only seems normal to back them. Even if Juventus had not qualified this would be a hard game for them and they don’t have a great record in Germany anyway.

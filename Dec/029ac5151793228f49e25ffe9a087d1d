Police were called to 40-year-old’s home in Islington on 12 December after reports of a man being assaulted and she was charged the following day. Ms. Flack’s partner, tennis player Lewis Burton, watched proceedings from the public gallery at Highbury Corner Magistrates’ Court. She will stand trial at the same court on 4 March. Ms Flack was released on bail on the condition she does not contact Mr. Burton directly or indirectly and or attends his address. Her solicitor, Paul Morris, had made an application to have these bail conditions lifted, arguing that they “remain a couple” and wanted to spend Christmas together.

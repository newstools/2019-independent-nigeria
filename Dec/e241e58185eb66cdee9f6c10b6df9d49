New information revealed that a man arrested for stabbing three performers at a live show in Saudi Arabia’s capital Riyadh last month was operating under orders from Al-Qaeda in Yemen and that he had a partner who covered up his plan. The Nov. 11 attack occurred at King Abdullah Park, one of several venues hosting a months-long entertainment festival in Riyadh. A hearing in Riyadh’s criminal court revealed that the unnamed attacker, arrested after stabbing two Spanish theatre performers and a security guard, had acted on the orders of a senior Qaeda leader in Yemen. The perpetrator, who holds the Yemeni nationality, is accused of committing an armed terrorist attack using a sharp device (a knife), which resulted in injuries, chaos, and terror among the audience. The indictment also included inciting others to carry out terrorist acts, belonging to Qaeda in Yemen, threatening public order. The other person – of Arab nationality – was accused of covering up the terrorist plot, dealing with counterfeit currency inside Saudi Arabia and purchasing guns with fake riyals.

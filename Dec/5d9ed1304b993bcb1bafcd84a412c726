GUSAU – There are indications that electoral officers of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Zamfara State, are auctioning their properties to settle the unpaid honorarium meant for ad hoc staff that was engaged during the February and March general elections in the state. According to a staff of the commission, who did not want his name in print, the development was the outcome of a probe by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) following the delay in paying the ad hoc workers for the service rendered. The source said the probe led to the arrest of a senior INEC official in the state after recovering N84.69 million. This, the source said, forced the electoral officers to sell off their personal properties to pay the ad hoc staff without recourse to the seized funds so that their problems would not escalate. Our correspondent learnt that a similar arrest was carried out in Kebbi State, pointing out that a probe that could have been handled by the internal administrative process of INEC was also generating controversy in the state offices of the electoral body. The source further said, “reports of such problematic encounters between INEC state officials and operatives of the anti-graft agency over the alleged complaints of unpaid of agreed sums of money to ad hoc staff used during the last general elections have generated a lot of controversies about the unnecessary autonomy of the electoral body under its current leadership, saying that this should be a matter of concern to all Nigeria. “In the case of Zamfara State, it was reported that some EFCC operatives arrested an INEC staff over allegations of nonpayment of allowances of the fieldworkers. When contacted, the state INEC Public Relation Officer, Alhaji Garba Dangaladima, denied having any knowledge about the sales of any staff ’s property just to settle the ad hoc staff. According to him, he was hearing the information for the first time, promising to dig into the matter after which he said he would address the press on the issue, saying that whosoever offends the law must go in for it.

Several prison employees have been fired and more than 30 others suspended after their training class was photographed making a Nazi salute in their uniforms. Two academy trainers and one cadet were dismissed from duty after the image emerged, the US Department of Military Affairs and Public Safety (DMAPS) announced on Friday. The photograph shows trainees at the West Virginia Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation making the Sieg Heil gesture underneath a sign reading “Hail Byrd” – a reference to a class trainer. Every trainee involved has been suspended without pay amid an investigation by DMAPS and the Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation, amounting to 34 individuals. Secretary of state for military affairs and public health, Jeff Sandy, said he was “outraged” by the incident.

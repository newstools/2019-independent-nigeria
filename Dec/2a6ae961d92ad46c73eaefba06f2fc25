The Minister of Youth and Sports Development , Sunday Dare, has berated the League Management Company (LMC) for its poor organization of the domestic football league. Dare, while speaking at the Nigerian Football Federation (NFF) Annual General Meeting (AGM) in Benin City insisted that the Nigerian Professional Football League (NPFL) cannot attract sponsorship. He said: “The bad image at all levels of our football including the organizers of the domestic league cannot attract sponsorship which is the biggest hub of business. “No country’s football can grow without a predictable and credible football calendar that is binding on everyone. The essence of having a football calendar is to ensure that the corporate world can plan with it. “No blue-chip firm operates based on hunches. Everything is planned with dates and milestones. No company will wait for NFF to wake up from its slumber to include them in their plans.” The minister warned the NFF and LMC to be on their toes as things have changed under his dispensation. “It is about time NFF and LMC behave like their international counterparts by yearly telling the world how much the country’s football is worth. “How much is the domestic league worth, dear LMC chieftains? It would enhance the Federation’s desire for corporate sponsorship if LMC can yearly state how much it got from INTER AND INTRA CLUB TRANSFERS. “At the click of the button on any electronic system including our mobile phones, we can know how much such transactions fetched other football Federations. “Not so in Nigeria. This must change since investors require such variables before entering into business with anyone,” he stated.

LAGOS – The House Committee on Public Accounts at its public hearing at the weekend, queried the Nigeria Ports Authority (NPA) over N5.1 billion headquarters renovation contract, demanding that original copies of the contractual agreement for the renovation of the Authority’s Corporate Headquarters in Lagos, awarded in 2011, be produced by the management. According to the Chairman of the committee, Wole Oke, the summon was based on a query by the office of the Auditor-General of the Federation on the contract awarded in 2011 with a completion period of 15 months without a signed contractual agreement. The query alleged that as at 2013 when the contract ought to have been completed and money paid out, there was no valid contractual agreement between the contractor and NPA. Hadiza Bala Usman, the Managing Director of NPA,  while speaking before the committee, however,said the contract was awarded by the Federal Executive Council (FEC), adding that available records show that there was a validly signed contractual agreement.

PERCY ONYEJEKWE NNEWI – Arcbishop Okafoagu of the New Covenant of God Mis­sion Nnewi, Anambra State, has predicted that Nigeria would experience worse chal­lenges in the year 2020. Okoafoagu made the prediction at the valedicto­ry church service to mark end of the year 2019 at the Akabo Ukwu Uruagu Nne­wi cathedral of the church yesterday. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Archbishop Okafoagu, who is also the Bishop of Masterseed College of Bish­ops USA, said the worse con­ditions coming were a result of desecration of the land by political leaders and individu­als, who chose to deviate from the precepts and natural laws of God. He noted that govern­ments, churches, individ­uals among other religious groups have failed to adhere to the will of the Almighty God and have chosen to go astray, a thing that has led government and the multi­tude to commit atrocities against themselves and God and attracting the anger of God against the country. Okafoagu said to avert the anger of God lessen the burden that would attend the year 2020, government espe­cially must seek the face of God through prayers. He said this could be done through in­stitutions of state, individuals and groups. “Worst conditions, chal­lenges are coming. The an­ger of God is upon the land; the people have gone astray. There are a lot of atrocities going on. To reverse the sit­uation, government should seek the face of God.”

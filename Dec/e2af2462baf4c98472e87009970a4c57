Leicester will be hoping to continue their spectacular run of form this weekend as they face relegation scrappers Norwich City at King Power Stadium. Brendan Rodgers’ men have won eight consecutive league games, becoming unlikely title contenders as Liverpool continue their unbelievable run of form. The Foxes are currently second, eight points behind the Reds, but crucially have a five point advantage over reigning champions Manchester City. Newly promoted Norwich, meanwhile, have endured an up and down return to the top flight, conjuring up just three wins this season. Daniel Farke’s side will need to come up with a special performance to have any chance of picking up a win, but we’ve already seen this season that the Canaries are capable of dispatching top class opposition, having seen off Manchester City at Carrow Road. Leicester have no fresh injury concerns ahead of the game at King Power, with Ben Chilwell’s return last week a huge boost. Midfielder Matty James remains a long-term absentee with an Achilles problem, though he has recently returned to training. Poland international Bartosz Kapustka, who is back at the club after a loan spell with OH Leuven, is still sidelined with a knee issue. Norwich are without long-term absentee Timm Klose, who has a knee injury, but may welcome back Switzerland striker Josip Drmic, who has been struggling with a hamstring problem since the 2-0 home defeat to Watford. Head to Head Record Despite a clear set of talent currently separating the two sides, their head to head record is pretty even. The Foxes hold the upper hand slightly, managing 23 wins against the Canaries’ 21. The clubs have managed 12 draws against each other and their most previous meeting was back in February 2016 when a Premier League fixture saw Leicester City win 1-0 against their opponents – the same season they were crowned champions.

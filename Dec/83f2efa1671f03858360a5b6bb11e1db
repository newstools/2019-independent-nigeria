When Lobi Stars walk into the pitch of Aper Aku Stadium in Makurdi on Sunday to face Katsina United, one thing will be at the back of their mind and that will first be to defeat their northern opponent and then for second placed Dakkada FC to fall to neighbours, Akwa United. Just like San Siro in Italy which is the home of both AC Milan and Inter Milan, Akwa Ibom International Stadium in Uyo is the home of both Akwa United and Dakkada FC also of Uyo and come Sunday, both teams will go head-to-head in one of the week ten games. Analysts believe that the match is a win-win one for either of the teams and a loss for Dakkada may see them lose the second spot. In fact, if Dakkada lose the game, they may fall as low as the seventh spot on the log because the difference between them in points and the team on the seventh spot is two. One of the clubs earnestly praying that the more experienced Akwa United defeat Dakkada are Lobi Stars, who are third on the log, just one point below the second placed debutants. Samad Kadiri, who has found the back of the net on a couple of occasions for the Ortom Boys, was quoted as saying that they hoped to topple at least Dakkada FC this weekend, hoping that Akwa United do them the favour by getting over the in-form NPFL debutants. “We are going to focus on the match on our hand which is the game against Katsina United. But that is not to say that we are not interested in what is happening in other centres. “Of course we are in a race with others and should rightly monitor other results. We hope to topple Akwa Starlets (Dakkada) if we are able to beat Katsina United and Akwa United beat them. “That is very possible and that is also how positions are calculated in football leagues, but for now, we are fully focusing on our game against Katsina United,” he said.

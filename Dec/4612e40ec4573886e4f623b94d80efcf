BENIN – Dr Oludare Adeyemi, an oncologist, has advised women to go for regular breast cancer screening in order to detect the disease early for immediate treatment. Adeyemi, a lecturer in the Department of Radiotherapy, University of Benin (UNIBEN) and a consultant in the University of Benin Teaching Hospital (UBTH), said the factors that cause breast cancer are main hormonal actors, age, environmental factors and lifestyle. The Oncologist who recently made a breakthrough in breast cancer treatment, disclosed that the symptoms of breast cancer includes breast lump or thickening that feels different from the surrounding tissue; change in the size, shape or appearance of a breast; as well as changes to the skin over the breast, such as dimpling. Others are, a newly inverted nipple, peeling, scaling, crusting or flaking of the pigmented area of skin surrounding the nipple (areola) or breast skin, redness or pitting of the skin over the breast, like the skin of an orange. Adeyemi who is also the Chief Medical Director of La’ Newton Oncology Clinic in Benin, said his clinic made a breakthrough in breast cancer treatment on patients recently, which he said does not requires mastectomy. Mastectomy, he said, is a surgical operation, which requires the cutting off of the breast. He disclosed that mastectomy procedure was first performed in Canada about two years ago, but is now being practiced in few places in USA, adding that procedure for the breakthrough is called Microseeds treatment using radioactive seeds. According to him, “This Microseeds treatment is the first in the whole of Africa and it came to Africa through Nigeria.” While revealing that the procedure conserves a breast, Dr. Adeyemi however, added that conserving a breast was vital for cosmetic reasons. He also said that microseeds treatment takes a day procedure unlike the conventional radiotherapy that takes four weeks to be completed.

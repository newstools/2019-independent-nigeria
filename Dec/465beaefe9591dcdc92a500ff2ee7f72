The South West chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has hailed the verdict of the Supreme Court over the March 9, 2019 governorship election that produced the party’s gubernatorial standard-bearer in Oyo State, Seyi Makinde, as winner.
The apex court had, on Wednesday, validated the ruling of the election petition tribunal that declared Makinde winner of the election and duly threw out the petition of the opposition All Progressives Congress (APC).
In a statement signed by the party’s South West Publicity Secretary, Ayo Fadaka, it’s National Vice Chairman, South-West Zone, Eddy Olafeso; Zonal Executives, leaders and entire members in the Zone congratulated Makinde on the victory at the Supreme Court.
The party insisted that in line with its position from the outset that the petition against Makinde’s victory was frivolous and baseless; the judgment of the Supreme Court has consigned the petition to the dust bin.
It noted that the decision of the apex court was consistent with the principle of justice administration and the desire of the people of Oyo State, which they expressed on March 9 by massively voting for the PDP.
The party said: “The National Vice-Chairman, Dr. Eddy Olafeso, the Zonal Executive, leaders, and entire members of the PDP in the Zone hereby congratulate the Governor of Oyo State, His Excellency, Oluseyi Makinde, all members of the PDP in Oyo State and indeed the good people of the State on his victory at the Supreme Court today.
“The verdict of the Supreme Court is consistent with the principles of justice administration and also the electoral desires of the people of that State as expressed in the Governorship election.
“The petitions of the APC and its candidate in that election were not only frivolous but also absolutely baseless. It only betrayed a desire to wish for a harvest where one does not have a farm. Politicians must begin to understand the need to be sportsmanlike when they lose elections fair and square.”

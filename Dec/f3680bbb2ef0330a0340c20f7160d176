Journalists and Niger State Government, on Wednesday, sharply disagreed on the N148.2b 2020 budget estimate submitted to the Niger State House of Assembly by the state Governor, Alhaji Abubarkar Sani Bello tagged: Budget of Inclusion For Sustainable Development”. Governor Bello had on Tuesday presented a budget estimate of, N148, 211,929,549.82 for the 2020 fiscal year to the legislature, with the Education sector having the highest allocation; N9, 244, 717, 304. 00, while Agriculture and Health came second and third, N8.784, 873, 358. 00 and N6.215, 326, 020.00 respectively. The Governor had informed the legislators at the Hon. Usman Jikantoro House of Assembly complex, Minna that 2020 budget was a product of extensive consultations from stakeholders hence the need for them to support and ensure its timely passage and implementation. The N148.2 billion budget is less than N44 billion budgeted for the current fiscal year, 2019 and is estimated to be financed from Statutory Allocation from the Federation Accounts to contribute N66.7 billion and Value Added Tax (VAT) N24.3billion. Other sources of funding the 2020 budget, Governor Bello had told the legislature included; Internal Generated Revenue (IGR) of N11.2 billion and capital receipt that includes, internal and external borrowing of N46.6 billion. However, demands for clarifications by journalists on the number of projects claimed to have been executed by Governor Bello led-administration which they said included projects executed by the immediate past Dr Mu’azu Babangida Aliyu’s government caught two commissioners struggling for an explanation.

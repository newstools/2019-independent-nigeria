LAGOS – Air travelers on the Lagos-Ilorin and Ilorin-Abuja routes are groaning over the skyrocketing air ticket of N55,000 one-way offered by only two airlines operating into the route. The passengers, who spoke with our correspondent wondered how a flight of fewer than 40 minutes could cost as much, stressing that lack of competition on the route fuelled the high ticket charge by the airlines. Only Arik and Overland Airways operate directly to the route. The Ilorin international airport is considered a major gateway in the geopolitical zone serving other neighboring states and cities within the state. Apart from serving the passengers from Ilorin, the airport also connects passengers from other major towns in the state like Offa, Omu Aran, Ekiti in Kwara South as well as Baruten, Kaiama in Kwara North, among others. An investigation by our correspondent indicated that an average a one-way ticket from Ilorin to Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport (NAIA), Abuja on Arik Air is N45,000 for a 40-minute flight while Overland charges N53,500 on the same route for a trip of the next day. However, the price varies according to the proximity of the travel date. Checks on the website of Overland indicated that the lowest fare on Abuja-Ilorin or Ilorin-Abuja is 38,500 for travel dates such as December 16; 20; 29; 30 and 31, while other dates cost between 40,000 to 50,000. This is more than the price of a return ticket from Murtala Muhammed Airport (MMA), Lagos to Abuja with a flight time of 50 minutes.Ilorin to Abuja on Arik costs N38,545 one-way while Arik doesn’t fly to Lagos from Ilorin.For Ilorin to Lagos, findings revealed that the lowest price on Overland is N38,500. One of the passengers who teaches in one of the universities in the state said: “The fares are too expensive and the airlines are making it difficult for people to fly.”

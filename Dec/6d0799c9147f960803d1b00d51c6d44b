ABUJA – The Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria on Friday said it totally support the policy of the Federal government on the closure of land borders. The CIBN said that the border closure is just checking the illegal activities that is going on at the borders. President /Chairman of the Governing Council of CIBN, Dr Uche Olowu who led the executives and other members of the institute on a courtesy visit to President Muhammadu Buhari told State House correspondents that Buhari has done well and deserved commendation. According to Olowu, the border policy is a clincher policy for us because it checks arms smuggling, support local industry to grow because that is the way to grow and of course infiltration of small arms have been curbing. He said: “People don’t seem to understand, let’s look at the philosophical foundation of the border closure. Clearly one was, there are a lot of dumping of goods into the country and then there are illegal and illicit trades that deprived the government of appropriate revenue. “Thirdly, the level of insecurity because most of the small arms were smuggled through those land borders. “We had a situation where the nation was subsidising the neighboring countries in terms of petroleum in the downstream sector. “If you have that context put in proper perspective then you will begin to appreciate the benefits of this policy. I do not agree with people who said local manufacturers cannot export their goods and services. “But the closure was not against local manufacturers. Pass through the right channel, the sea border is not closed. It’s land border, it’s just checking the illegal activities that are going on.”

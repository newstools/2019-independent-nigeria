Beijing has ordered every public institution in the country to remove foreign computer equipment and software within three years, according to the Financial Times. The newspaper reported that the order was made by the Chinese Communist Party’s central office earlier this year, and is the first publicly known directive obliging government offices to begin purchasing equipment from domestic technology vendors. According to the newspaper, it is part of a campaign in China to increase the country’s use of domestic technologies and reduce its dependence on foreign vendors.

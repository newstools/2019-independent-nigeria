ABUJA – Professor Charles Dokubo, the Special Adviser to the President on Presidential Amnesty Programme (PAP), has hinted of impending audit of the operation of the intervention programme to actually ascertain the number and true identity of beneficiaries of the N65, 000 monthly stipends paid to the former Niger Delta militants. The renowned academic made the disclosure on Wednesday in Abuja, noting that the exercise has become necessary, as the programme winds down, to curtail noticeable abuse and corruption that has crept into the amnesty programme. The programme, which was conceived by late former President Umar Yar’Adua in 2009, was geared to address rife agitation and destruction of oil installations in the oil rich Niger Delta region. Although still in the works, he hinted that the audit to be conducted in the various states with the aid of security operatives, would thereafter bar those who fail to appear for the audit with their identity cards from receiving the monthly stipends. He, however, maintained that payment of the amnesty stipends was the life wire of the programme as its prompt payment serves invaluably to “buy peace” at any point in time. Stressing that the amnesty programme cannot continue forever, he cried that entrenched interests and a worrisome sense of entitlement among some states in the oil producing zone have seriously detracted from the objective for which the programme was created, leading to unnecessary agitations, litigations and demands. He expressed shock that ten years after the programme was concieved, it is inconceivable that the number of ex-militants that returned arms and were captured in the database of PAP has remained 30,000 despite various educational and empowerment initiatives by the programme geared toward their self-sustenance. Professor Dokubo, who said he was specially assigned to change the direction and complete the amnesty programme, insisted that there was the need for beneficiaries and people of the zone to adjust their views and key into the focus of his administration, which is centered on training, engagement of trained ex militants and provision of needed infrastructure for a sustainable development of youth of the region. The Presidential Amnesty Programme coordinator also dismissed insinuation that he was being investigated, explaining that the reported invitation by DSS  and EFCC was in respect of activities of past holders of the office, adding that some adverse reports stem from the changes he has introduced in the scheme.

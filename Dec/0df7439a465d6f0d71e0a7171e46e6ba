Former US Democratic Presidential Candidate, Hillary Clinton, has praised the impeachment of Donald Trump by the US House of Representatives. Clinton, who lost to Trump in the 2016 US elections, said Trump had abused his powers and left the lawmakers no choice but to approve his impeachment. “One of our most precious rights as Americans is the right to determine who our leaders are,” she tweeted on Wednesday. “The president abused his powers to cheat in the next election and rob us of that right. Then he obstructed Congress to cover it up. Impeachment is the only remedy.” Hillary Clinton

Trump was impeached for abuse of power in a historic vote in the House of Representatives on Wednesday, setting up a Senate trial on removing him from office after three turbulent years. By a 230 to 197 vote in the Democratic-majority House, the 45th US president became just the third occupant of the White House in American history to be impeached.

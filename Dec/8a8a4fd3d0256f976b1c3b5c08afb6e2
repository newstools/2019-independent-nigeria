YENAGOA – Aghoro Community in Ekeremor Local Government Area of Bayelsa State has raised the alarm that the Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) of Nigeria Limited arbitrarily reduced the compensation value for the May 2018 oil spill incident from N3.68 billion to N34 million. According to the community, the SPDC had proposed to pay them N34 million as compensation for the ravaging oil spill, arguing that the figure was far below the sum of N3.68 billion recommended by the National Oil Spills Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA). The joint investigation visit report of the oil spill concluded that the incident was caused by equipment failure, resulting in a leak from the Trans Ramos pipeline of the SPDC which spread into the environment and polluted the area. The JIV report also said that the oil leak discharged some 1,114 barrels of crude oil into the Aghoro environment and impacted an estimated area of 113.03 hectares. Friday Otigha, an official of the Aghoro Community Development Committee, who spoke in Yenagoa, condemned the SPDC for the poor compensation, stressing that the N34 million offered by the oil firm was unacceptable and not commensurate to the impact assessment report of the oil spill. He said, “Despite a recommendation of N3.68 billion by the National Oil Spills Detection and Response Agency for the oil spill, the SPDC proposed a paltry N34 million, which we have rejected. “Hundreds of our fishermen and farmers lost their livelihoods because of the oil spill. We are disappointed because Shell is expected to act in line with international best practices.”

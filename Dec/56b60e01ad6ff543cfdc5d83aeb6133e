ABUJA – The Acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, (EFCC), Ibrahim Magu, on Wednesday, identified corruption as an encumbrance that will continue to hinder sustainable development in the world, if left unchecked. Magu made the observation during the opening of a two- day High-Level Conference on Fast-Tracking Implementation of the United Nations Convention against Corruption, UNCAC, in Support of the Sustainable Development Goals at State House Banquet Hall, Presidential Villa, Abuja. Magu, who was represented by the Commission’s Secretary, Olanipekun Olukoyede reiterated the Commission’s avowed determination to eradicate corruption in Nigeria and partner with both national and international stakeholders in addressing the malaise. The EFCC boss assured that the EFCC would continue to collaborate with the UNODC and other partners to amplify the UNCAC convention in support of sustainable development goals. He, however, observed that efforts by state parties to domesticate the convention have been slow due to barriers around legal technicalities and matters of sovereignty, saying these barriers have constrained the return of stolen assets. Nevertheless, Magu stated that the Commission remains committed to the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. “EFCC will continue to update its skills, resources and systems in response to new and emerging forms of economic crimes and continue to partner with international and national partners in furtherance of this mandate,” he stated. The EFCC helmsman said the Commission has achieved a lot in the last four years in the areas of assets recovery, prosecution, arrests and convictions. The high-level conference attracted key stakeholders in the fight against corruption in Nigeria, including the country representative of the UNODC in Nigeria, Oliver Stolpe and the Director of the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit, Moddibo Tukur.

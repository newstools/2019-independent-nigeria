LAGOS â€“ Chuks Nwachukwu, the presidential candidate of All Grassroots Alliance (AGA) in the last general elections, has said that Uche Secondus, the PDP national chairman, did not mean that the party would boycott future elections if election rigging persists in Nigeria. Recall that Secondus reportedly said his party would no longer participate in elections in the country if the issue of manipulation of election results and other electoral irregularities by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) were not addressed. Nwachukwu, while reacting to the position of the PDP national chairman, said Secondus actually meant that the electorate could devise an alternative means of choosing their leaders. Nwachukwu told Daily Independent on Tuesday that Secondus was not necessary saying that PDP would not participate in elections but was also trying to notify the electorate that if their mandates would not account, they could have options of resorting to other means of expressing their views, and choosing their leaders.

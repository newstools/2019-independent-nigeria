The Duke of Cambridge completed his tour of Kuwait by observing a military exercise between British and Kuwaiti troops before landing in Oman on Tuesday afternoon. Prince William was greeted by an Omani military guard at Khasab air base after a short flight from Kuwait. Earlier in the day, William joined 120 troops from the British Mercian regiment at the Sheikh Salim Al Ali National Guard camp in the Kuwait desert for the bi-annual Desert Warrior exercises. 2nd Battalion, The Mercian Regiment

Earlier in the visit, Prince William took part in a beach-cleaning exercise, telling his hosts that his team were all carrying metal, reusable water bottles, and that he and his wife recycle “as much as we can”. “I hate plastic bottles now and I look at them and I literally think it’s the enemy,” he said. After a lunch with Kuwait’s Emir Sheikh Sabah, Prince William took part in a desert camp experience on Monday. He was shown local handicrafts and falcons and spoke to young entrepreneurs in a tent majlis. Russell Myers

Prince William will now head for Oman, where he will follow a similar programme of wildlife and environmental sightseeing, meeting young people and strengthening military links. It is his first official visit to both countries, following in the footsteps of his father and grandmother.

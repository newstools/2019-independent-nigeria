Arsenal look to have taken a significant step towards appointing their success to Unai Emery, with chief executive Vinai Venkatesham spotted leaving Mikel Arteta’s home in the early hours of Monday morning. Venkatesham, alongside club lawyer Huss Fahmy, arrived at Arteta’s home in Didsbury at 11pm on Sunday evening and spent more than two hours with the former Gunners midfielder before leaving at 1.20am. As a result, Arteta is now seen as the leading contender to take the reins at Arsenal. The Gunners have been without a permanent boss since head coach Unai Emery was sacked at the end of November, with Emery’s number two and former player Freddie Ljungberg taking interim charge. But results have not got any better, with Ljungberg overseeing just one win in five games in charge. With Venkatesham and Fahmy spotted leaving Arteta’s house, it seems a breakthrough is imminent and following those photos and reports, bookmakers Paddy Power have suspended betting on Arteta becoming the new head coach at the Emirates. Not only that, but they coulod not resist a little dig at the Gunners too. Announcing that betting on Arteta becoming the next Arsenal manager has been suspended, the notorious bookmaker added: “Seemingly yesterday’s performance hasn’t deterred him from taking over.” Arteta, assistant to Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola, was on the sidelines for the club’s 3-0 victory over Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium, which continued a disappointing vein of form for the Gunners. Should he arrive in North London, he will have significant work to do as Arsenal have won just one of their last 12 matches in all competitions.

Japan hanged a Chinese death-row inmate on Thursday convicted of killing four people in 2003, the Justice Ministry said, in the country’s first execution since August, according to Asia.nikkei.com reports. The inmate was identified by the ministry as Wei Wei, 40, whose death sentence for the murder in Fukuoka, southwestern Japan, was finalized in 2011. It was the first execution ordered by Justice Minister Masako Mori since she assumed the post in October and the third execution this year. The latest hanging brought the number of executions under the government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who returned to power in 2012, to 39. Last year, a total of 15 death-row inmates were executed — AUM Shinrikyo doomsday cult founder Shoko Asahara, 63, and 12 former members of the group, in July, as well as two others in December. According to the final ruling, Wei burgled the home of Shinjiro Matsumoto, 41, a clothing dealer, in June 2003 and killed him, his wife and their two children, in a conspiracy with two other Chinese men. Wei and his two compatriots, who were in Japan on student visas, submerged the four bodies in Hakata Port by attaching weights. The two accomplices were arrested by Chinese authorities after fleeing to China. One of them was sentenced to death and executed in 2005, while the other received life imprisonment in return for having surrendered to the authorities and cooperated in investigations. Wei’s defense team had sought a lighter sentence, arguing that his role in the crime was subordinate. But the Fukuoka District Court gave him the death penalty in May 2005. The Fukuoka High Court upheld the first ruling and the Supreme Court rejected Wei’s appeal in October 2011.

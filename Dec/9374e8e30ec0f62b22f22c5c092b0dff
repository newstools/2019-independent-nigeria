The French government’s High Commissioner for Pensions Jean-Paul Delevoye resigned on Monday after local media reported that he had failed to publicly declare posts that he had held in parallel to his cabinet position. The resignation, first reported by Le Monde newspaper, comes at a crucial moment for President Emmanuel Macron whose government is in a standoff with unions who have stepped up protests unless the government withdraws its pension reform proposal, Reuters reports. The French presidency in a statement said that it had accepted Delevoye’s resignation which he had tendered to not harm the work of the executive. “The president hails his personal commitment and his work on the pension reform,” it said. “His withdrawal allows the clarification of the situation.”

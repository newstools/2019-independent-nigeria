Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) General Secretary, Sanusi Mohammed, says Gernot Rohr’s contract renewal depends on the decision of the Federation’s technical committee. Sanusi said this during an interview on Nigeria Info FM, saying he was unable to say if the German tactician would be sack or not. Recall that Rohr has been at loggerheads with NFF President, Amaju Pinnick over the issue of his contract renewal. During the federation’s 75th Annual General Assembly in Benin, Pinnick revealed Rohr would be offered a new deal, but the NFF won’t go out of their way to satisfy the German. However, speaking in an interview with Nigeria Info FM, Sanusi revealed that it was the responsibility of the NFF technical department and Committee to decide the fate of the German. “The issue of appointment and sacking of coaches is the responsibility of the technical department and also the technical committee. “If you want to know whether the Super Eagles coach will be sacked or not, you should ask the technical department or the technical committee,” he said.

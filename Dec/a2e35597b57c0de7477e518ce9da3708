Disclosing that his state was currently paying N25, 000, Obaski stated that N30,000 won’t be a problem for him to pay but it’s not enough for workers considering the economic situation of Nigeria. Obaseki said: “Funding Education, Health, Research Institutions and Other Social Services in a Depressed Economy: Challenges and Prospects. “I want to assure you, due to the work my predecessor in office did, we have currently the minimum wage of N25,000 in Edo state, so moving to N30,000 is not going to be a big thing for us at all. “For me personally, I don’t think the emphasis should be on N30,000 minimum wage, the emphasis should be on improving the environment in which workers work such that they can be more productive and justify what we pay. N30,000 you can agree with me cannot take workers home. “So what we should be angling for is to demonstrate that workers are producing much more than they are being paid and on the basis of that, demand a fairer share of what they are producing. “We must continue to insist that education is key, not only for the development of human capital, but also for attractive citizenry poised to the development of our community and country at large.”

Worried by the appalling environmental sanitation indices in the country, the Environmental Health Officers Associations of Nigeria (EHOAN) has called on state governors to commence without delay, the implementation of the Executive Order 009 to end open defecation in Nigeria by 2025. President Muhammadu Buhari last month signed Executive Order 009 titled ‘The Open Defecation-Free Nigeria by 2025 and Other Related Matters Order’ to end the open defecation in the county before 2030 deadline by WHO for the eradication of the practice all over the world. In a communique issued at the end of its 51st National Scientific Workshop/2nd International Conference themed ‘Open Defecation-Free Community: A Key to Achieving Sustainable Health, Social and Environmental SDGs in Nigeria’, held in Kano, the association described as worrisome and embarrassing, the practice of open defection across the country, among other recommendations to achieve early attainment of Open Defecation free status, urged the Nigerian Governors’ Forum and Association of Local Government of Nigeria (ALGON) to key into the road map of the Federal Government to end the ugly menace. It lamented the gross shortage of environmental health workforce across the country, which according to the document currently indicated, that “8,526 Environmental Health Officers( EHO) are serving a population of about 200 million Nigerians – a ratio of about one EHO to 24,500 population, which a far cry from WHO’s recommendation of one EHO to 8,000 population”. The body advised government at all levels to urgently embark on a deliberate mass recruitment and mobilisation of health workers to urgently improve environmental health services in the country.

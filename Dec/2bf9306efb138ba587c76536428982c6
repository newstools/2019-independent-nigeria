 ADO-EKITI – Ekiti Local Government Election held on Saturday turned violent as one Dotun Kosedake was allegedly shot dead by suspected political thugs at Ikere Ekiti. Four others sustained injuries and were reportedly receiving treatment at an undisclosed hospital. The election, which witness low turn-out of voters, was peaceful before it turned bloody in the town. An eyewitness confirmed that the gun wielding thugs invaded a polling unit at Okitiko in Araromi area of Ikere Ekiti, shooting sporadically, thereby disrupting the poll in the unit. “Apart from the man that was shot, about four people were wounded and the SIEC officials had to take to their heels. The boys came to snatch ballot box and when they were resisted, they started shooting. One person was killed in the process,” the eyewitness said. He said four others who sustained injuries had been taken to the hospital for intensive care. Police Public Relations Officer, Ekiti Command, Mr Sunday Abutu, said he had not been briefed at the time of filing this report. Reacting to the outcome of the election, the PDP chairman in Ekiti, Barrister Gboyega Oguntuase, said: “From what we heard all over, the election is riddled with violence, obviously as expected in an APC state. It is not fair. As I speak with you, it is believed that they have shot one person dead, as one or two persons received gun shots.” On whether the PDP would reject the outcome, he said, “Can any reasonable person accept the result of an election that is riddled with violence and fraud? It is clear. We won’t accept it.” On whether the PDP would go to court, Oguntuase said consultations would be made with the leaders to know the next line of action.

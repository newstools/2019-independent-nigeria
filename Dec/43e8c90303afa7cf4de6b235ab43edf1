Donald Trump’s re-election campaign is having vice-president Mike Pence put a special emphasis on a key set of states going into the election 2020 by sending him out on the road to court suburban and religious voters and shore up the president’s base. Pence, the second highest ranking official in the Trump administration, has been campaigning heavily in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin over the last year, a sign of the importance those states hold to the Trump campaign’s re-election strategy. Those states all went for Trump in the 2016 presidential election, surprising Democrats, and are an essential battleground for both Trump and the eventual Democratic presidential nominee in 2020. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network To Republicans, Pence is an ideal liaison to key voting blocs in those three states. He’s a devout Christian and former governor of neighboring Indiana whose ties to the evangelical wing of the Republican party are famously strong. Temperamentally, he’s less bombastic than Trump but falls more toward the conservative end of the Republican party. Over the past few weeks, Pence had made stops in all three states. Since August, he’s visited Michigan four times, Pennsylvania three times and Wisconsin twice, according to figures obtained by the Guardian.

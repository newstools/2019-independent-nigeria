LAGOS – Argentine boxer, Antonio Barracamonte, arrived Lagos last night for World Boxing Federation (WBF) Intercontinental heavyweight title bout against US-based Nigerian, Onoriode Ehwarieme. Baracamonte, said he is not in Nigeria for tourism, but to win the title. Speaking through his manager, Patricio Agustin Retondaro, on arrival at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport in Lagos, the boxer said that he was happy to visit Nigeria for the first time. “I’m very happy to be here in Lagos, Nigeria. I have received a very nice welcome from the people. But I’m not here for sightseeing. I’m here for business, which is to return to Argentina with the WBF title. Onoriode stands no chance of winning. “I’m not boasting. That he’s fighting in his country is no advantage. I’ve defeated many boxers in their home countries, so he won’t be an exception,” he said.

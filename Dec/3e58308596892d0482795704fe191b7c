Barcelona have prioritized the signing of a deep-lying playmaker and a centre-forward in the new year, and Sport claims the La Liga leaders have identified their preferred targets for both positions, according to Espn.co.uk reports. The Spanish publication believes Donyell Malen of PSV Eindhoven and Inter Milan’s Lautaro Martinez are Barca’s chief targets for the attacking No. 10 position, while Martinez’s Inter colleague Stefano Sensi is rumoured to be manager Ernesto Valverde’s favoured candidate to be the long-term successor for Sergio Busquets. Martinez, 22, has had a hand in 11 goals in 18 games for Inter this season, while former Arsenal trainee Malen, 20, has 11 strikes of his own in just 14 Eredivisie appearances. Midfielder Sensi, meanwhile, has impressed at the San Siro during a season-long loan spell from Sassuolo, but Malen is seen as the cheaper option for the No. 9 position, with Inter valuing Martinez at north of €100 million.

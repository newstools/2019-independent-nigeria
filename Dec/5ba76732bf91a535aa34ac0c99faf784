Benin – Pally Iriase, immediate past Deputy Chief Whip of the House of Representatives, has declared that the Social Investment Programme (SIP) and the current administration’s investment in human capital development had brought governance closer to the people. The former Owan Federal Constituency representative stated this at Otuo, near Afuze, Owan East Local Government Area of Edo, during the kickoff ceremony of skill acquisition training programme for no fewer than 300 woman and youths in the constituency. While noting that before President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration, Nigerians knew almost nothing about social investment programme, noting that the president had introduced dynamism into what the SIP is all about. According to him, “What is happening today is the realisation of my dream to have our people trained in skill that will make them self-sufficient that will help them become entrepreneur and alleviate poverty from Owan Federal Constituency that I represented until recently. “You will recall that the 2019 budget did not start early and it is only recently that releases came, trickling in respect of projects and programmes that were contained in the 2019 budget. “It is those projects that I facilitated that gave rise to what is happening today. “My thanks are fully to the Federal Government for making human empowerment, social intervention a part of governance.” “As it is usual for some of us who love to be responsible representative, we try to dove tail our constituency outreach to the key policies of the federal government. “It is my own little way to ensure that my constituency intervention fund was channelled appropriately to bequeath skill that will empower members of my constituency. “I must commend the Federal Government for being determined to make life meaningful for the citizenry.”

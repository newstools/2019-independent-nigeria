Information reaching Independent has it that the district head of Birnin Gwari Central, Yusuf Abubakar, has been abducted along Kaduna-Birnin Gwari Road on Wednesday 18th Dec 2019. The Kaduna-Birnin Gwari road was among the roads where checkpoints were dismantled by the Kaduna state government as a way of curbing the problems of incessant kidnappings in the area. Kidnapping and other crimes, Independent learned, had subsided to a very low rate. Though the road, as well as the general area of Birnin Gwari, is notorious for kidnapping activities the intervention of security operatives and the vigilante group in the area has also helped to reduce the crime rate in the area. The kidnapped District Head Mallam Yussuf Abubakar, who is said to hold the title of Sarkin Kudun Birnin Gwari, was kidnapped alongside another traditional title holder, Wakilin Makarantar Birnin Gwari, Ibrahim Musa. Independent learned that they were kidnapped around 12 pm at Unguwar Yako, a flashpoint along the road. Speaking with Independent, the police public relations officer Abubakar Sabo acknowledged the receipt of the report, as he promised to get back as soon as he gets the full details from the DPO of the area.

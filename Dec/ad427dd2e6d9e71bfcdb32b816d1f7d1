Alex Zverev has resumed training following successful eye surgery a week ago. “My eyes are recovering, they’re still red,” he said following the surgery, adding, “I’ll start to train again soon.” Zverev had said during the ATP Finals that he planned to have the surgery because of frequent problems playing with contacts. The 22-year-old German followed his appearance at the ATP Finals with a South American exhibition tour with Roger Federer, and then a vacation, but has shown photos of himself on social media doing fitness sessions this week. Zverev, who is number seven in the rankings, next plays the ATP Cup.

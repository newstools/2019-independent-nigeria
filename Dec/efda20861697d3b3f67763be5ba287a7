Everton manager Carlo Ancelotti has ruled out Alex Iwobi out of action until the New Year. The Super Eagles, who missed their game against Burnley on Boxing Day, was forced off only 11 minutes into their 0-0 draw with his former club Arsenal last weekend after sustaining a hamstring injury. The 23-year-old has since been nursing the problem and may not play a further role for the Toffees this year as he is set to be sidelined for about ‘two to three weeks.’ “Alex Iwobi is not going to play in the next games,” Ancelotti told Everton TV. “He is going to rest for two or three weeks, then start [training] with the team.” Iwobi has made 20 appearances across all competitions, scoring two goals since leaving the Emirates Stadium last summer. Everton, who are winless in their last three games, will hope to halt that unimpressive form under their new manager at Goodison Park. Meanwhile, Super Eagles defender, Leon Balogun was not included in Brighton and Hove Albion’s squad against Tottenham Hotspur on Boxing Day, who they lost 1-2. The 31-year-old has not featured in a Premier League game this season for the Seagulls, owing to his inconsistent form and struggles with injuries. The Nigeria international has only made one appearance for Brighton this term which was in a League Cup tie against Bristol Rovers back in August.

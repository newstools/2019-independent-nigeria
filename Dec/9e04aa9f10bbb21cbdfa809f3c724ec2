This brownfield development, which is expected to start-up in 2024, will increase the yearly production capacity to more than 30 million tonnes per year (Mtpa) from the present 22.5 Mtpa. The expansion project will produce an additional 7.6 Mtpa of LNG, of which 4.2 coming from one new liquefaction train (Train 7), and 3.4 coming from the detangling of existing trains. NLNG is a world class 6-train LNG facility, in operation since 1999. In 20 years, the plant has delivered over 4,700 LNG cargoes around the world. With this expansion, it will become one the world’s most important LNG gas hub, and it will allow partners to further leverage Nigeria’s abundant associated gas resources. Eni is a founding partner of NLNG and holds a 10.4% share. Other partners are NNPC (49%), Shell (25.6%), and Total (15%). This project will also add more than 1 Mtpa of capacity to Eni’s global LNG portfolio.

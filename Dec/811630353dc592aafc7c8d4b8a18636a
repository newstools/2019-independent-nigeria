South Africa’s rand was barely changed in late trade on Friday, with fresh optimism over Sino-U.S. trade talks helping the currency to weather stronger employment numbers from the United States. At 1530 GMT, the rand edged 0.07% firmer at 14.6400, improving from session’s low of 14.6950 on Thursday following a batch of lukewarm economic indicators sapped demand, Reuters reports. Sentiment towards emerging market currencies was boosted after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that trade talks are “moving right along,” despite Beijing maintaining its stance that some existing tariffs must come off as part of an interim agreement. That helped limit an expected souring of risk demand after job growth in the U.S. increased by the most in 10 months in November, the strongest sign yet the economy was not in danger of stalling, and that the central bank might consider not easing rates. On the bourse, stocks rose alongside global shares on the back of the trade deal optimism. The benchmark JSE Top-40 Index was up 0.98% to 49,065.21 points while the broader All-Share Index rose 1.05% to 55,357.33 points. “What has really just gave us a boost right now was nonfarm payroll number out of the U.S,” said Nilan Morar, trader at GT247. U.S stocks were set to open higher after data showed that nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 jobs last night, higher than the 180,000 additions predicted by economists. “You’ve got U.S up about two thirds a percent, you’ve got Europe up about a third of a percent on average and we’re following suit as well,” Morar added. Mining heavyweights Anglo American rose 2.73% to 398.56 rand while retail-led healthcare company Clicks were up 2.48% to 256.66 rand.

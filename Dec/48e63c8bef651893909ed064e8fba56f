A breakdown of the figures indicated that crude oil export sales contributed $267.97million (75.29 per cent) of the dollar transactions, compared with $150.73million contribution in the previous month; while the export gas sales amounted to $87.96million in the month. The September 2018 to September 2019 Crude Oil and Gas transactions indicated that crude oil & gas worth $5.63billion was exported.
The results which have largely characterized the operations of the corporation were sustained with the posting of a trading surplus of �8.59billion recorded in the month under review. The report indicated a significant increase of 65 percent compared to the �5.20billion surplus posted in August 2019. The August figure of �5.20billion surpassed the �4.26billion surplus posted in the previous month of July 2019, reflecting an increase of 22 percent, according to the September edition of the report. The improved surplus posted in the upstream and downstream sector transactions of NNPC’s subsidiary companies, Integrated Data Services Limited (IDSL), Nigerian Gas Company (NGC), Nigerian Gas Marketing Company (NGMC), Petroleum Products Marketing Company (PPMC), Nigerian Pipeline and Storage Company (NPSC), and Duke Oil Incorporated, explained the significant increase of 65 percent in the September trading of the corporation, the report said.

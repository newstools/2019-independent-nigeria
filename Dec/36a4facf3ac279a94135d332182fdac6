Arsenal star Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is attracting interest from Barcelona, according to reports. However, the Gabon international is prepared to wait until the end of the season before deciding his future. Arsenal star Aubameyang has been a shining light amid a difficult campaign for the Gunners, with the forward scoring 15 goals across all competitions so far. However, amid his fine form, the Gabon international has been backed to leave the Emirates. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Arsenal would love to tie Aubameyang down to a new contract but, should they finish outside the Premier League top four again, a move away appears to beckon. Le10 Sport say that Barcelona would love to snap him up and pair him alongside Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Antoine Griezmann in attack. Yet Aubameyang is willing to wait. He’s supposedly decided he will stay in north London until the end of the season, when he’ll then weigh up his options. A second reason for his decision – though it’s not stated in the report – may be because of his fondness of Real Madrid. Earlier in his career, the 30-year-old promised his grandfather he’d one day don Los Blancos’ colours. And Aubameyang may choose to sit tight and wait to see if Real come calling. The chances of that, though, appear mixed.

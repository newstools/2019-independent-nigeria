Two teams inside the Premier League relegation zone will lock horns on Saturday afternoon as Watford welcome Aston Villa for what should be a fascinating affair. Watford are currently 19th in the table with 13 points, five points behind 18th-placed Villa, who picked up a morale-boosting 1-0 victory over fellow strugglers Norwich on Thursday afternoon. There is no getting away from the fact that it has been a desperately poor campaign for Watford thus far, but it would also be fair to say that the team has shown great improvement since Nigel Pearson joined the club. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The Hornets picked up a huge 2-0 win over Manchester United last weekend and followed that result by drawing 1-1 away to high-flying Sheffield United on Boxing Day. Four points from their last last two matches, coupled with Norwich’s struggles, has seen Watford move off the foot of the table. They are still six points from the safety of 17th position, but there is still a lot of football to be played before the end of the 2019-20 campaign. The Hertfordshire club have incredibly only scored 12 Premier League goals this season, but Troy Deeney’s return has been hugely important, while Gerard Deulofeu impressed against United before putting in another excellent performance against the Blades on Boxing Day. Watford have also won their last two Premier League matches against Villa, with their last meeting at Vicarage Road taking place in April 2016.

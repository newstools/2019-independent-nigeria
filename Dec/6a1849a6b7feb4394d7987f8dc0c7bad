The Nsugbe community in Anambra East Local Government Area of Anambra State has alleged that the Special Assistant to the Governor Willie Obiano of Anambra State, Osita Nwoye, was threatening to visit mayhem on them. Nwoye, whose controversial appointment as Chairman, Caretaker Committee of Nsugbe Development Union (NDU), has been resented by Nsugbe indigenes, had allegedly threatened to deal ruthlessly with the inhabitants of the town through his recent Facebook post in Akuoyibo Nsugbe Forum. They also accused him of intimidation and misrepresentation of their community. He had allegedly vowed to deal ruthlessly with any indigene that challenged the action of the state government in his Facebook post, insisting that “Obiano and APGA don’t care if we kill our self ’s (sic).” In a press statement at the weekend, the Public Relations Officer of the Committee of Chairmen and Secretaries of Nsugbe Development Union (CCSNDU), Emeka Odikpo, said the threat by Nwoye was callous. The statement noted that “Nwoye is threatening the community; we understand the import of his statement and we find it ridiculous”. Odikpo, who is also a Lagos based lawyer, added: “The words Nwoye used in the Facebook post to wit that: ‘Obiano and APGA don’t care if we kill ourself’s,’ clearly speaks volumes of the type of embarrassment he constitutes to the Anambra State governor that made him a Special Adviser.” He further stated that there were allegations from Nsugbe that Nwoye advised Nsugbe residents “not to pay electricity bills because ‘Obiano has paid the electricity bills for 10 years’. “This is a clearly ridiculous and spurious statement,” Odikpo said. He added: “Nwoye is wrongly accusing our governor of insensitivity to the point of not caring if Nsugbe people kill themselves.”

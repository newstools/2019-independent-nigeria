OSOGBO – Osun State chapter of All Progressives Congress (APC) has assured the people of the state that there is hope in near future in the state. The party, in a Christmas message signed by its Director of Publicity, Research and Strategy, Barrister Kunle Oyatomi, copy of which was made available to newsmen in Osogbo, said the future of the state would certainly be bright under Governor Adegboyega Oyetola-led APC government. According to the party, “indications from the outgoing year 2019 presage a pace-setting flourish of economic, industrial and social development for 2020 unlike anything the state has witnessed in the current decade.” The party said already, the investment made by the state government, which had transformed Osun into a business-friendly environment, was producing such encouraging results that investors (local or international) were pledging to set up in the state in 2020. “This is a further reason for thanksgiving by the people of Osun during this advent and new year celebration,” the APC declared.

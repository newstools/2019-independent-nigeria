ABUJA – The Forum of Non- NWC members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has called for a quick resolution of lingering intraparty crises within the ruling party, saying it has become a major cause of distraction to President Mohammadu Buhari. The Forum also called for the immediate review of suspensions slammed on members by the national
working committee to pave way for roundtable discussion among feuding party members toward forging a united and enduring APC. In a statement issued at the end of its meeting in Abuja and jointly signed by its chairman, Nelson Alapa and Omolaoye Akintola, its secretary, the forum has also requested President Buhari to direct the inclusion on Non-NWC members into boards of federal parastatals. The statement reads, “On the 10th day of December 2019 Executive members of the above Forum met in Abuja to passionately examine the intra-party crises engineered and fueled by intrigues and conflicting political interests, we, therefore, call on all the concerned parties to put every difference behind and move the party forward. “Consequently, we appeal to all party leaders and stakeholders to sheath their swords majorly to allow President Mohammed Buhari and his team concentrate on pressing national issues and policies that would promote  peace, harmony, economic growth, improved security and solid foundation laid for the Next Level Agenda for our dear country-Nigeria. “We equally suggest that the party Leadership review critically various suspensions and other administrative actions which have generated crises with a view of bringing all the concerned to a round -table for harmonious resolution of such issues towards having a stronger Party that can stand the test of time. “The Presidency is further being enjoined to ensure that none-NWC members, Party officials, nominees/committed Party members generated from the States are fixed into Federal Boards, Agencies and Commissions within the shortest time possible,” the statement added. The group pleaded with the general public, particularly the teeming supporters of APC, to continue to give the President and the party all needed supports until the much-desired stability and Nigeria of everybody’s dream is actualized.

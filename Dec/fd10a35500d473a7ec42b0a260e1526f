ASABA – Delta State residents have been advised to key into the Private Sector Participants (PSP) scheme in waste disposal. Project Coordinator, Delta State Nigeria Erosion and Watershed Management Project (NEWMAP), Mr. Isaac Ufiofio, gave the advice during a five-day sensitisation workshop/documentary production exercise across the five erosion and flood intervention sites in the state. While addressing stakeholders at Obomkpa, Ukwu-Uzu, Ubulu-Uku, Owanta and Jesse communities on proper way of waste management, Mr. Ufiofio frowned at indiscriminate dumping of waste along undeveloped plot, street corners, roads and water channels. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The NEWMAP boss, who was represented by the Project’s Environmental Officer, Mr. Benedict, Anaro, said it was to clean the state of filth and avoidance of blockage of drainages for free flow of water channels. He said stakeholders’ partnership with PSP would go a long way to address the environmental and sanitary condition of the urban and semi-urban towns in the state. Ufiofio said poor waste management has created serious health problems which have resulted to loss of lives and man-labour hour, saying illness such as malaria, dysentery, among others, are associated with poor waste handling and can be communicated through vectors such as mosquitoes, rodents and housefly.

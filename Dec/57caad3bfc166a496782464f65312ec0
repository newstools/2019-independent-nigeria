ABUJA – The managing director of Nigeria Railway Corporation (NRC) Engr. Fidel Okhira,says  has   he allowed  preferential treatment and favouritism in ticket sales. Reacting to questions on alleged ticket racketeering and shortchanging of railway passengers, Okhira,  told participants at the on-going maiden transport summit of Chartered Institute of Transport Administration in Abuja that he cannot pretend not giving tickets to favour some passengers. “I am not a hypocrite, I cannot pretend, someone like Madam (referring to a guest) cannot say she wants to travel and I say ticket is finished or ask her to go and queue. “I must find a way to provide ticket for her. I cannot hide behind a finger to say I don’t do it” he said . He admitted that the Abuja Kaduna route is over stretched  and assured that more coaches  will arrive in January 2020. He also said the Warri to Itakpe rail service will commence in the first quarter of 2020, while  rail passengers in the south south and south east  areas of the country will enjoy  travel at average speed of 120km per hour soon. On vandalism, he disclosed that over 5000 clips and 10,000 bolts and nuts have been  replaced along the Lagos – Ibadan rail track due to vandals activities capable of causing fatal rail accidents.

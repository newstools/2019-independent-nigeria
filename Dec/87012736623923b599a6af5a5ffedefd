The U.S. has imposed sanctions against two top South Sudanese ministers, accusing them of prolonging the conflict in the country “for their own personal enrichment” and delaying the formation of a unity government. The U.S. Treasury said that the addition of Minister of Cabinet Affairs Martin Elia Lomuro and Minister of Defence Kuol Manyang Juuk to Washington’s sanctions list was designed to “apply pressure” on the country’s factions. The deadline for a unity government ended on Nov. 12. “The South Sudanese deserve leaders who are committed to laying the groundwork for a successful, peaceful political transition,” said Justin Muzinich, a deputy secretary at Treasury. According to U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the United States stands ready to impose other measures against any who seek to expand the conflict and derail peace efforts in South Sudan. Pompeo added that sanctions can be lifted if the ministers “demonstrate measurable support” for peace. The U.S. was a key player in helping South Sudan declares independence from Sudan in 2011, following decades of conflict. However, two years later the country was plunged back into war between factions loyal to President Salva Kiir and opposition leader Riek Machar, leading to tens of thousands of deaths and the displacement of some 4 million people. The U.S. withdrew its ambassador from Juba in November and has been upping the pressure on the factions in the country to end violence and institute stability.

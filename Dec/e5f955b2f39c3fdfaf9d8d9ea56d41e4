Iba Gani Adams, Aareonakakanfo of Yorubaland, has opined that the new local government bill will enhance development at the grassroots. Speaking in Ikorodu, Lagos, during the 2019 edition of Ogun Festival, the Yoruba leader affirmed his beliefs in the autonomy of the local governments, saying the old arrangements had only made the local governments lose their relevance. He said the new arrangement will boost infrastructure and bring about healthy relationship and competition that will later translate to the overall development of the entire state. “Within the purview of my position as the Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, I think the newly amended bill for local government autonomy was a welcomed development. Before the new development, the local governments across the country have lost their relevance. “But, the new bill really raised the hope of the people at the grassroots. As far as I am concerned, I know the bill will surely expose the potentials of the local governments by bringing development to the grassroots. “Local government remains the closest to the people and the people will surely feel the impacts with emerging young and brilliant politicians coming up for elective positions,” he stated. He further expressed delight that the bill will reduce the idea of political godfatherism and would also open up the political space for independent candidates, as well as providing opportunity for young politicians that had suffered political loneliness in the hands of political leaders.

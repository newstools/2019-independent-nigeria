LAGOS – 1996 Olympic gold medallist, Patrick Pascal (MON) has advised ex international to invest in grassroots football programmes in their respective states. The chairman of the Bauchi State Football Association said that former players must get involved in football administration in their various states, if they want to make serious impact in the game. He said that policy formulation would be easy if they were in charge of the football administration of their states. “I am not excited that most ex-internationals are not coming out to make meaningful contributions to the game they love so much but the truth is that they can have a say if they are in control. “My advice is that they need to return home and organize various community football tournaments in order to be recognized by their immediate environment. “One of the ways other ex-internationals can make their voices heard is to also be in charge of their Football Associations (FA), then they will not be sidelined,” he said. He said that former players have the capacity to identify exceptional talents but must have either coaching certificates or agents licenses. “Everyone cannot go into sports administration but others have their eyes on coaching or scouting. They must ensure that they get coaching certificates from CAF which is our African body or FIFA coaching courses. “Others can decide to go for scouting programs so that they can help identify hidden talents from the grassroots and outside the country,” he concluded.

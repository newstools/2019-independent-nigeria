The Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency (LASEPA) has said that has re-opened Club Quilox, after securing the management’s commitment to comply with the state’s Environmental Laws, Regulations, Guidelines and Standards. The General Manager, LASEPA, Dr Dolapo Fasawe, said in a statement on Saturday that the club was reopened after management committed to carrying out its activities without obstructing the flow of traffic on Ozumba Mbadiwe and other adjoining streets. Fasawe said at the club’s management promised to ensure its clients’ vehicles were properly parked in designated areas. She said the club had also demonstrated firm commitment to ensure that sound emanating from musical events hosted within its facility does not exceed the recommended limits set by the state. The popular club, owned by Mr Shina Peller, a member of the Federal House of Representatives, had organised a 36-hour non-stop event that led to traffic gridlock and noise pollution, affecting Victoria Island and its environs.

Southampton will be looking for their third Premier League victory in a row when they welcome Roy Hodgson’s Crystal Palace side to St Mary’s this Saturday afternoon. The Saints have won their last two – including a 2-0 success at Chelsea on Boxing Day – to rise into 14th in the table, while a solid campaign to date has left Palace in ninth position with 26 points. Southampton did not win a single match in any competition between September 28 and November 23, at which point the club’s owners must have been tempted to change their manager in order to reset. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The Saints have now won four of their last six in the Premier League, though, including back-to-back victories over Aston Villa and Chelsea in their last two top-flight outings. Thursday’s two-goal success at Stamford Bridge was hugely impressive and the result saw Ralph Hasenhuttl’s side end Boxing Day in 14th position in the table, three points clear of the bottom three. There is still a long way to go this season, but the team’s form and indeed performances in recent weeks suggests that they will have enough to secure another campaign of top-flight football. Southampton have also won three of their last five Premier League meetings with Palace, suffering just one defeat in the process. That said, the loss during that run came at St Mary’s in January 2018. A record of 26 points from 19 Premier League matches has left Palace in ninth position in the table. They have won seven of their 19 league games this term, which is the same number as Manchester United and Sheffield United, and indeed more than Wolverhampton Wanderers.

OWERRI – The Nigeria Union of Pensioners (NUP), Imo State, has called on Governor Emeka Ihedioha to institute audit query in respect of irregular and non-payment of their pensions by the immediate past administration in the state. Josiah Ugochukwu, chairman of the union, told newsmen in Owerri that many of its members already verified by the government of former Governor Rochas Okorocha could not be issued their cheques while those who were issued cheques could not cash them because they were issued dud cheques. The NUP Chairman, who disclosed this while speaking on preparations for the 18th edition of Pensioners’ Day celebration in the country with the theme: “Pains and Gains, Minimizing the Pains, Maximizing and Sustaining the Gains” said, “As I am speaking to you, many pensioners are still having those cheques unpaid just as many whose cheques were verified as written were not issued the cheques.” Ugochukwu expressed suspicion that the cheques might have been used to open fictitious bank accounts and drawn by agents of the previous administration in the state. According to him, during the period in question, the issues of gratuity were treated with what he described as “maradonic disposition,” and “As I am talking to you now, the Imo State government owe over 12 years of gratuity to retired civil and public servants, exacerbated by the insensitivity of the erstwhile Governor Rochas Okorocha administration

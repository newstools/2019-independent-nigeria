AWKA â€“ Anambra citizens, under the auspices of Anambra Demand For Soludo (ADS), have unanimously pleaded with the former Central Bank Governor (CBN), Prof. Charles Chukwuma Soludo, contest in the next governor of Anambra State come 2021. The group expressed confidence in the ability of the former CBN governor to deploy his vast knowledge, experience and expertise to revitalize, as well as reposition the state for economic prosperity. The group made the plea in Awka at the weekend while presenting Prof. Soludo as the most suitable candidate to succeed Governor Willie Obiano. Emecheta, an opinion leader from Anambra-South senatorial zone said they have resolved that Soludo was the best person for the governorship seat. He said governance was not about road construction or building industries but having the intelligence and technical know-how to catapult development to unimaginable heights. Emecheta said that Soludo has been in Anambra State in the last eight years and understands the developmental needs of the citizenry, as it relates to infrastructure in all its ramifications. According to him, Anambra citizens do not need governors with ostentatious lifestyles but with modest personality with financial prudence, frugality and discipline, which he said, were all embedded in Prof. Soludo. He, however, suggested that it would be worthwhile if the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) considered Soludo as concensus candidate as it would amount to a waste of time and resources going to the primaries, when all the aspirants on the platform of APGA can be made to accept Soludo as the flag-bearer.

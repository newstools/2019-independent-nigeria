Patrick Vieira could beat Mikel Arteta in the race to become the new Arsenal head coach, according to reports. Arteta was thought to be close to landing the job after holding talks with Gunners managing director Vinai Venkatesham and club lawyer Huss Fahmy at his Manchester home during the early hours of Monday morning. But according to Eurosport France, fellow former Arsenal captain Vieira is the favourite to be appointed ahead of Arteta. Vieira, who was a member of the Invincibles team under Arsene Wenger, joined Manchester City after retiring and worked as a Football Development Executive, before working with the club’s reserve team and as elite development squad manager. In 2015, he was appointed as the head coach of New York City, with Vieira guiding them to fourth and second in his two full seasons at the club. In June 2018, he was appointed as the manager of French side OGC Nice, with Vieira leading them to a seventh place finish in Ligue 1. This season, Nice sit 13th in the table with 24 points from 18 games. Vieira is understood to have been on the Arsenal board’s initial 10-man shortlist, but the claims from France would still be surprising given the advanced talks with City assistant head coach Arteta. Arsenal supporters took to social media to react to the reports, with many underwhelmed. Z

However, football.london understands that Arsenal are hoping to conclude talks with Arteta imminently, and the Gunners remain confident of sealing a deal for the Spaniard. It is believed that Arteta met director Josh Kroenke, son of owner Stan, on Monday evening and it will be up to those two to provide the final green light for a candidate who has been the front runner since Unai Emery was sacked over a fortnight ago. Should Arteta take the job the makeup of his staff would not be immediately clear. Arsenal would, however, wish to retain Ljungberg as assistant head coach should he want to remain.

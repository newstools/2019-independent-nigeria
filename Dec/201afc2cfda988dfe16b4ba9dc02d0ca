Lagos – The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has forecasted that the global airline industry would earn a net profit of $29.3bn in 2020. This is an improvement of $3.4bn earning when compared to the 2019 expectation by IATA. The global body had projected that the airline sub-sector would earn a net profit of $25.9bn in 2019, which was revised downward from a $28bn forecast in June. If the IATA’s projection is achieved, 2020 would mark the industry’s 11th consecutive year in the black. According to IATA, return on invested capital is forecasted to be 6 per cent, an improvement from 5.7 per cent expected in 2019, while the net profit margin is forecast at 3.4 per cent and this is up from 3.1 per cent for 2019). IATA projected that the overall industry revenues would reach $872bn, which is 4 per cent improvement on $838bn projection for 2019. Industry operating expenses are projected to climb 3.5 per cent to $823bn from $796bn in 2019. Passenger numbers are expected to reach 4.72 billion, up 4 per cent from 4.54 billion in 2019. Besides, freight tonnes carried are expected to recover to 62.4 million, a 2 per cent increase over 61.2 million tonnes carried in 2019, which was the lowest figure in three years. Stronger economic growth should support passenger traffic (RPKs) growth of 4.1 per cent similar to 2019 of 4.2 per cent, but below historical trends. Average net profit per departing passenger of $6.20, an improvement from $5.70 projected in 2019. Economic performance in 2019 was weaker than had been anticipated at the time of the June forecast. This aligns with weaker global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of 2.5 per cent. These negative developments contributed to softer passenger and cargo demand and corresponding weaker revenue growth, as passenger yields fell 3 per cent and cargo yields dropped 5 per cent compared to 2018. Operating expenses did not rise as much as anticipated, largely owing to lower-than-expected fuel costs; but this was not enough to offset the softness in revenue. “Slowing economic growth, trade wars, geopolitical tensions and social unrest, plus continuing uncertainty over Brexit all came together to create a tougher than anticipated business environment for airlines. Yet the industry managed to achieve a decade in the black, as restructuring and cost-cutting continued to pay dividends. “It appears that 2019 will be the bottom of the current economic cycle and the forecast for 2020 is somewhat brighter. The big question for 2020 is how capacity will develop, particularly when, as expected, the grounded 737 MAX aircraft return to service and delayed deliveries arrive,” said Alexandre de Juniac, IATA’s Director General. For 2020, economic growth is forecasted to expand by 2.7 per cent in 2020, marginally above the 2.5 per cent growth in 2019. World trade growth is expected to rebound to 3.3 per cent from 0.9 per cent in 2019, as election year pressures in the USA contribute to reduced trade tensions. Growth is supported by actions from central banks as well as easing fiscal policy.

Oil prices rose yesterday in thin pre-Christmas trading after Russia said cooperation with the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) on supply cuts would continue and amid signs Saudi Arabia and Kuwait could take as much as a year to bring a major field back to full capacity. Brent crude was up 74 cents, or 1.1%, at $67.14 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate was 47 cents higher at $60.98 a barrel. OPEC and Russia will continue their cooperation as long as it is “effective and brings results”, Russian energy minister Alexander Novak said in an interview on Monday. It would be recalled that OPEC and allies agreed in November to extend and deepen output curbs in place since 2017. The reduction of output could see as much as 2.1 million barrels per day (bpd) taken off the market, or about 2% of global demand. Still, OPEC needs to do more to balance the market on a sustainable basis, Bjornar Tonhaugen, head of oil market research at Rystad Energy, said in a note. “The OPEC cuts didn’t fully solve the problem instead they offer a light bandage to get through the first quarter of 2020,” said Tonhaugen. A deal signed on Tuesday between Kuwait and Saudia Arabia on the Neutral Zone between the two countries could add to supply next year. The agreement aims to end a five-year dispute between the OPEC members and reopen fields which can produce 0.5 million bpd or 0.5% of global supply.

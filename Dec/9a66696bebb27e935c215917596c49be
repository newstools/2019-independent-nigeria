Italian tax police said on Wednesday they seized documents from units of motorway operator SIAS, following the collapse last month of a bridge after a massive landslide caused by heavy rains in the northwestern region of Liguria. Police visited offices of SIAS units Autostrada dei Fiori in Turin and Sina in Milan and the coastal town of Savona and took documents relating to the collapse of the bridge on the A6 highway near Savona on Nov. 24. Police said in a statement that they seized documents about “engineering, construction, regular inspections and maintenance” of the bridge.

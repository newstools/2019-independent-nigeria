A rape victim who was set on fire by her alleged rapist India while on the way to court has died in hospital, the doctor treating her has said. The 23-year-old was on her way to board a train in the Unnao district of northern Uttar Pradesh state, to attend a court hearing on Thursday. She was doused with kerosene and set on fire by a gang of men, including her alleged rapist, police say. It is the second prominent case of violence against women in the past two weeks and has sparked public outrage in India. Dr Shalabh Kumar, the head of burns and plastic department at New Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital said: “She suffered 95 per cent burns.” He added that the woman’s windpipe was burnt and “toxic and hot fumes” had filled her lungs. The victim was airlifted to New Delhi for treatment but she died on Friday after suffering a cardiac arrest. The woman had filed a complaint with Unnao police in March alleging she had been raped at gunpoint in December last year, police documents showed. She named two local men, one of whom was arrested by police while the other absconded. Having been subsequently jailed, the alleged rapist was released last week after securing bail, police officer SK Bhagat said in Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh state. On Thursday, the rape victim was seized by five men, including the two people she had named in her complaint, and beaten, stabbed and set on fire, local media reported citing her statement to police. Following the attack she walked nearly a kilometre, seeking help before finally calling the police herself, according to Aaj Taj TV news channel.

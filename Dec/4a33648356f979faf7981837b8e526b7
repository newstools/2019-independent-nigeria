LAGOS – Trabzonspor of Turkey midfielder, Ogenyi Onazi has admitted he is excited to be back playing again with his club in the Turkish Super Lig, following almost a year out with a career-threatening injury, and now hopes to battle Denizlispor in their next match on Monday. The former Super Eagles’ vice-captain admitted he felt worried when several attempts to return to action from an Achilles tendon injury failed to materialise, as he kept getting relapses, until he was finally able to come through unscathed in Thursday’s Europa League fixture against FC Basel of Switzerland. It was a heroic return for the- Jos-born midfield battler, who last played active football when he got injured on December 23, 2018 in a 4-1 against visiting Caykur Rizespor, after which the ex-SS Lazio of Italy midfield enforcer had to go for surgery. Onazi told SCORENigeria: “I am so excited to be back, for me this is one important moment in my life. I just want to thank God for His grace. “I really want to say a big thank you to my coach who believedinme, waitedforme, tothe team and the medical staff, the physiotherapist for a good job.

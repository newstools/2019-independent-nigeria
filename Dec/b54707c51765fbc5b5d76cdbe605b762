Public sector workers in Lagos State have been charged to redouble their efforts to boost productivity and render selfless quality services to Lagosians to reciprocate Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s approval of N35, 000 new minimum wage. A former Commissioner for Public Transportation in the state, Chief Lanre Razak, who gave the charge in an interview with journalists in Ikeja on Tuesday, further commended the state government for the current massive construction work on some major highways aimed at easing traffic congestion and bringing permanent relief to residents. Recall that Sanwo-Olu had through a circular signed by the state’s Head of Service, Hakeem Muri-Okunola, recently approved N35000 new minimum wage for civil servants, which is N5,000 above the N30,000 national benchmark which the Federal Government and labour leaders agreed upon. But, reacting to the pay rise, Razak noted that the gesture was a further demonstration of the administration’s commitment to staff welfare in a bid to making the state’s civil service second to none among the 36 states. He added that public servants owed it as a duty to reciprocate the gesture by showing more dedication to duty and rendering qualitative public services to the citizens of Lagos. According to him, Sanwo-Olu, by “committing his administration to paying the highest minimum wage to workers in the state, has not only demonstrated his belief that the civil service is the engine room of government’s developmental agenda and growth, but the primacy of human capital in the successful implementation of THEMES Agenda. “By this development, the governor has sent clear a message that he means well for the workers and Lagosians following the overwhelming mandate freely given to him by the electorate in March and determined to implement people-oriented policies and programmes in line with the All Progressives Congress, APC manifesto and the Next Level Agenda of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led federal government aimed at making life more meaningful to citizens.” Razak, a member of the Governor’s Advisory Council (GAC), expressed satisfaction with the pace of construction work on various dilapidated highways and carriages in the state, noting that road users were beginning to get relief while plying the critical roads.

AWKA – The Senior Special Assistant to Governor Willie Obiano on Petroleum and Union Matters, Comrade Peter Nwosu has assured Anambra citizens that government would take necessary steps to ensure that the state does not experience product scarcity or hikes in the prices of petroleum products during and after Christmas. The governor’s aide also emphasized that government has set machinery in motion to forestall hoarding of Premium Motor Spirit and other petroleum products that might lead to an artificial scarcity that would plunge the citizenry into misery and untold hardships this festive season. Speaking during an exclusive interview with our correspondent in his office at the government house Awka yesterday, Nwosu disclosed further that he has toured some depots and refineries to ensure that petroleum products due for Anambra, would come directly to the state without diversions. He also said that the state government has acquired about 20 hectares of land around Enugwu-Agidi area of Njikoka local government area, that would be used as petrol tanker park. According to him, the aim of establishing the park was to curtail the menace of petrol tanker drivers in the state, adding that when fully operational, the park would serve as a multi-purpose garage, where tanker drivers coming into Anambra state would stop over to have some respite and continue their journey afterwards while serving as a revenue source for the state government.

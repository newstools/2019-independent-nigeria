This followed the adoption of a motion brought before it by Hon. Sam Onwuaso in plenary. Onwuaso, while debating the motion, noted that NUC’s accreditation system has been used over the years to maintain and monitor quality and high academic standards in Nigeria universities. He further noted that the NUC uses the accreditation process to evaluate programmes every five years He averred that in the course of carrying out its mandate, the NUC accreditation team undertook on-the-spot assessment of facilities, lecture halls, quality of programme contents, laboratories among others to ensure that the universities meet up with required standard to run such programmes. The lawmaker, however, expressed worries that there are allegations of intimidation and extortion of huge sums of money from universities in order for their programmes to be accredited. He informed the House that the alleged monetary demand for accreditation might have led to some universities increasing their tuition fees so as to be able to meet up the demands
of NUC accreditation teams Consequently, the House presided by the Deputy Speaker Hon Ahmed Idris Wase unanimously adopted the motion. The deputy speaker mandated the House Committee on Tertiary Education and Services to investigate the matter and report back to the House within 6 weeks for further actions

William Troost-Ekong and Seko Fofana delivered impressive performances as Udinese beat Cagliari 2-1 in Saturday’s Serie A game. After a five-game winless run, including last weekend’s loss to Juventus, the African stars were at their best to ensure Luca Gotti’s men ended their miserable run of results at Dacia Arena. Troost-Ekong, who made his 15th league appearance in the encounter, had a 73% successful pass rate. Fofana, meanwhile, was afforded his eighth start of the season and set up Rodrigo De Paul for the opening goal of the match in the 39th minute.

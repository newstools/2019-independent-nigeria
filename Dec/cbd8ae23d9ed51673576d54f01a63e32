A Facebook user, Oghenetejiri Charity took to a Facebook group to share screenshots of her chat with a pastor named Emiaso Oke Emir who reportedly cursed her for refusing to give him her phone number. The lady:  Quoting the Bible, the disgruntled pastor proclaimed thus: ‘By the authority and power invested in me by God as a man who ruleth over the world and have dominion over the earth, you shall die without a husband”  The resentful pastor further insulted the lady’s parents and generations.

LAGOS – Senator Seye Ogunlewe, former Minister of Works has described as normal in a democracy to have capital projects distributed in a lopsided manner, stating that it is dependent on the depth of lobbying a Senator can do to attract projects to his or her constituency.
The former lawmaker said that Senate management team made up of the Senate President, Deputy Senate President and the principal officers must always be lobbied by Senators to achieve the desired result, maintaining that the senator who must perform in the National Assembly must make friends with them, do a lot of networking and key into the dictates of the leadership to achieve success.
“There is a section where discussions are made outside the floor of the house and if you are tagged as anti-principal officers, you will not be part of the system. You must be supportive of the management team to make meaningful progress.
“You can be in opposition and still be in good books of the principal officers. I was in opposition when I was elected, vice chairman of inter-parliamentary union worldwide. I was a member of the Alliance for Democracy (AD). They voted for me all over the world as an AD Senator,” he said.
The All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain maintained that what was playing out at the Senate over the N50 billion extra projects was not something new, stressing that achieving success at the senate would always depend on how a Senator is ready to move, pointing out that he or she must behave properly, and where the lawmaker operated like an outsider, he or she would just be there for four years without notice.
He maintained that it was part of democracy and anyone seeking to make success of his tenure must strategize to achieve a good result, whether as opposition or member of the ruling party.

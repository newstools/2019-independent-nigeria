Kwara State governor, AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, has spelt out the priorities of his administration to include big investments in education, infrastructure, health, agriculture, enterprise, and human capital development. In an address to wrap up the three-day retreat held for his cabinet in Patigi, the governor said the state was almost starting from the scratch across every sector, especially education and primary healthcare, even as he told the appointees to be ready to spend long hours, listen more, and work as a team to rebuild the state. “The manifesto has been dissected and as you have known, we are going to emphasise on key issues because if we try to do everything, at the end of the day, we might look back and see that we’ve probably done nothing,” AbdulRazaq said, detailing the challenges ahead and the opportunities in them for Kwara. “We have to do big in agriculture, healthcare, education and enterprise – social investment scheme, job creation and infrastructure. I was just coming from Kpada. A journey of 30 minutes from Patigi took almost two hours. “There is no road, no electricity, the health care and the school system has collapsed and so on. These are part of the challenges you will face when you assume office. It cuts across,” he said. He urged the appointees to ensure that they constantly relate with their communities for their input in governance, saying his administration would not abandon projects inherited from the previous one, but might renegotiate the contracts to save public funds.

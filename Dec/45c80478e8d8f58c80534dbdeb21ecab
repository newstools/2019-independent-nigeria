ABUJA – The number of children whose births are officially registered has increased significantly in Nigeria from 30 per cent in 2013 to 43 per cent in 2018 as birth registration has been by integrated into health services. On the contrary, UNICEF declared that about 17 million children under 5, or 1 in 5 remain unregistered, according to a new report on global birth registration released by the global body on Wednesday. Peter Hawkins, UNICEF Representative in Nigeria said, “We have come a long way in Nigeria and ensuring that children are registered through the health services is making a big difference – but still too many children are
slipping through the cracks. “These children are uncounted, unaccounted for and nonexistent in the eyes of the government or the law. Without proof of identity, children are often excluded from accessing education, health care and other vital services, and are vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. ” Worldwide, 166 million children under-five, or 1 in 4, remain unregistered, according to the new report Birth Registration for Every Child by 2030: Are we on track? In which analyses data from 174 countries and shows that the proportion of children under-five registered globally is up around 20 per cent from 10 years ago; increasing from 63 per cent to 75 per cent. In West and Central Africa, under-five registration increased in 10 years from 41 per cent to 51 per cent, despite the multiple challenges the region is facing. “Birth registration in West and Central Africa remained stagnant for a long time, leaving millions of children without their basic right to legal identity. This situation has now changed and millions of more children are registered at birth”, said Marie-Pierre Poirier, UNICEF Regional Director for West and Central Africa

More so, I want to advise our members not to drink before or while driving and ensure that their vehicles are in good condition before they put them on the road,” he said. Baruwa, who commended the President Muhammadu Buhari-led Federal Government for its massive road construction and rehabilitation projects, urged Nigerians to embrace unity and peace in the New Year. He stated that it was only in an atmosphere of peace and unity that the nation could achieve her desired progress, adding that Nigeria is a country with much potentials and opportunities. “We should be mindful of the reformation and transformational programmes of the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led Federal Government. “Let us join hands with the federal, states and local governments to get our nation out of the woods. We should know that Rome was not built in a day. “Nigeria, as the largest black nation in the world, is in the eye of the whole world, so we all have roles to play to get us to the Promised Land as we move to a New Year,” he said.

A bus plummeted off a hill in Tunisia on Sunday morning, killing 26 passengers who were on an excursion in the country’s north. The private bus, with 43 people on board, set off from Tunis to the picturesque mountain town of Ain Draham 115 kilometres west of the capital near the Algerian border, a popular winter destination for Tunisians. Ain Draham is located at an altitude of 800 meters on the slopes of the Djebel Bir, one of the Kroumirie mountains. The bus was travelling through the Ain Snoussi region when it veered off a winding road after the driver failed to manoeuvre a sharp turn and plunged over the cliff, the Interior Ministry said. Pictures and video shared online showed the mangled remains of the bus, with its seats scattered on a river bed. Bodies and personal belongings were strewn on the ground. The Health Ministry said the victims were between 20 and 30 years old. The injured were transferred to nearby Amdoun and Beja hospitals. Forensic experts were sent to investigate the crash. It was not immediately clear what caused the accident but Tunisian roads are known to be notoriously dangerous. Tunisian President Kais Saied and Prime Minister Youssef Chahed visited the site of the accident. Prime Minister Youssef Chahed interrupted a visit to the south of the North African country to return to the seat of government in Kasbah where a crisis centre has been set up.

ABUJA – Indications emerged on Tuesday that President Muhammadu Buhari may be facing much pressure from political stakeholders to resubmit the name of the Acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) Ibrahim Magu to the National Assembly for confirmation. The plot became glaring, when a civil society group under the auspices of Accountability and Good Governance initiative (AGGI), argued that recent conviction of former Abia State governor, Orji Uzor Kalu as well as Senator Joshua Dariye of Plateau State were enough justification for Magu to be retained. Further proofs that the executive was under pressure was the argument by the group that since there was stability in the 9th National Assembly, the confirmation ought not to be delayed. It also noted that contrary to claims in some quarters that the President was using the anti-graft fight to witch-hunt perceived political opponents, more members of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, have been convicted than people from the opposition political parties. Jacob Okpanachi, National Coordinator of the group said it is on record that the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC have “secured 313 convictions in 2018 and 160 by first quarter of 2019”. He also argued that the only way to sustain the tempo of the anti-graft war was for the executive arm of government to resubmit the name of the EFCC acting chairman to the Senate for confirmation in substantive capacity. He said: “Notable bigwigs including prominent former governors and politicians across party lines have been given their respective sabbatical in the various prisons facilities now christened correctional centres across the country.

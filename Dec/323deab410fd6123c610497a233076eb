YENAGOA – The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) has sealed off four petrol stations in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State, for under-dispensing petrol and lack of basic operational equipment and poor safety standards. The Assistant Chief Officer, DPR Yenagoa Field Office, Prince Oshodi, who led a team of officials on the department’s first phase of Christmas and New Year surveillance exercise, ordered the closure defaulting filling stations. The affected filling stations include D’Arizona Nigeria Ltd; SOBAZ Oil and Gas Ltd; Timikon Petroleum and one NNPC retail outlet. Oshodi, in an interview with newsmen, warned owners of filling stations against engaging in sharp practices during the Christmas and New Year celebrations. He explained that the exercise became imperative in order to monitor filling stations and ensure availability of products throughout the festive period. He said there would be zero tolerance for marketers who breach safety standards and sell products above the official approved pump prices as well as under-delivery. According to him, the DPR was determined to protect Nigerians from exploitation by “quick-rich marketers”, especially during the yuletide season.

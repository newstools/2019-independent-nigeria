There was anger in the Apapa area of Lagos on Saturday as an official of the Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA), Ola Oyeshina, was killed in the vicinity. The agency’s General Manager, Mr. Olajide Oduyoye, who confirmed the barbaric incident decried the attack Oyeshina suffered. According to a statement by LASTMA’s spokesman, Mr. Olumide Filade, on Saturday in Lagos, he said the man was attacked during the course of sanitising the Iganmu-Sifax axis of Apapa, saying a large stone was thrown at the late officer. He said he was immediately rushed to Area “B” police station along with two of the people that attacked him. Oduyoye revealed that owing to the trauma experienced, Oyeshina was immediately referred to the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH) from Randle Hospital, Surulere. “It is unfortunate that the agency lost the promising young officer to the cold hands of death in the early hours of Saturday, November 30, 2019,” the General Manager said. He assured that the perpetrators of the dastardly act would be prosecuted in the court of law to serve as deterrent to other members of the public. “LASTMA was established to manage and control traffic in order to reduce the people’s travel time on our roads, increase economic growth through increased productivity and ensure the populace safety and security. “A situation where road users will now turn against any government official in order not to answer the consequences of breaking the law is unacceptable and would not be condoned henceforth. “With the recent inauguration of a committee on war against traffic and environmental offenders, there is no more hiding place for Lagos residents or visitors that go against the law,” Oduyoye said. The state government had in 2018 said that 18 LASTMA officers were killed, while 24 others had been permanently incapacitated in the line of duty.

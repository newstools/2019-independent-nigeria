Ernie Els, South African golfer and recent Presidents Cup International Team captain has confirmed his return to the Saudi International from January 30 to February 2, 2020. The event was introduced to the European Tour schedule for the first time last year, several months after journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed in Istanbul for speaking out against the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman. As a result, a number of golf fans and writers alike were against some of the world’s best golfers competing in the tournament. Els will, however, line up against world No 1 Brooks Koepka and American duo Dustin Johnson and Patrick Reed. The ‘Big Easy’ came agonisingly close this month to setting up a historic win for the International team against the USA in Australia but lost 16-14. The 50-year-old will return to the the Royal Greens Golf & Country Club after making his debut in the event earlier this year. “I may have just turned 50, but I still want to tee it up against the best players in the world and the way this tournament is shaping up, it will be the biggest field in golf at the start of next year,” said Els in a press release. The Royal Greens Golf & Country Club will host the first Ladies European Tour event in March next year.

Mikel Arteta wants to make Juventus midfielder Adrien Rabiot his first signing as Arsenal manager, according to a report in England. The Times is reporting that the Gunners boss is a big admirer of the France international and Arteta is hoping to add Rabiot to his squad. The same article states that the Gunners are hoping to initially secure the 24-year-old on a season-long loan deal following Rabiot’s lack of first-team opportunities at Juventus this season. According to the same story, Arsenal’s bid to sign former Paris Saint-Germain star Rabiot isn’t connected to Granit Xhaka’s future at the north London outfit. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The Times go on to add that Arsenal have been linked with a bid for Rabiot in the past but the midfielder decided to move to Juventus from PSG in the summer. Rabiot has started five of Juve’s 17 Serie A games this season, making a further four appearances from the bench in the Italian top flight. The Frenchman is currently competing with Miralem Pjanic, Rodrigo Bentancur and Blaise Matuidi as well as ex-Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey and former Liverpool FC star Emre Can for a starting spot. Arsenal played out a 1-1 draw with Bournemouth on Boxing Day in Arteta’s first Premier League game in charge of the north London outfit. The Gunners – who host Manchester United on New Year’s Day – will be hoping to hoist themselves up the Premier League table following Arteta’s appointment.

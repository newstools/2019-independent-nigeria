Thousands of protesters clashed with security forces in Lebanon on the eve of a parliamentary sitting that is expected to select caretaker Prime Minister Saad Hariri to form a new government. Security forces fired tear gas and threw stones at protesters on Sunday who gathered outside Beirut’s Nejmeh Square, where parliament is located, and which has been closed off to the public since the outbreak of nationwide protests started 60 days ago. Aya Majzoub, Lebanon researcher for Human Rights Watch, said on Twitter at least four protesters had been injured by rubber-coated bullets. For nearly two months, protesters have sought to remove a ruling class of former civil war-era militia leaders and businessmen who they accuse of bankrupting the country through corruption and mismanagement. Facing enormous street pressure, Hariri resigned on the 13th day of protests. But more than six weeks later, the main demands of the hundreds of thousands who have taken to the streets namely, the formation of a government of independent experts and early elections – have not been met. Instead, Hariri seems set to return after a number of other candidates failed to garner enough support from Lebanon’s Sunni establishment. Lebanon’s prime minister must be Sunni under the country’s complex sectarian power-sharing system.

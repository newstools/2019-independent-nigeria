Nigel Pearson say he is “very confident” that his Watford team can avoid relegation from the Premier League after they collected just their second win of the season against Manchester United at Vicarage Road. The Hornets moved within six points of safety and level on points with Norwich in 19th after defeating a dismal United side that remain eighth. “We are in a difficult situation but I believe we can get out of it,” said new Watford boss Pearson. “We needed that very badly because it would have been difficult to go beyond Christmas without a win. “I thought we did some good things, deserved to win the game and there is more to come. “In the situation we are in, we have do anything we can to win a game. The players committed to the game exceptionally well. “I’ll be very confident we can get out of this situation.” Watford were helped on their way courtesy of David de Gea’s error for their opening goal, with the Spanish keeper allowing Ismaila Sarr’s mishit shot to bounce through his arms and strike him in the face as it entered the net. Troy Deeney compounded a miserable day for United as he registered his first league goal since April with a penalty after Aaron Wan-Bissaka’s foul on Sarr. Not even the introduction of Paul Pogba – returning after a near three-month absence – as a substitute could raise United, who failed to register a shot on target until the hosts were already two goals ahead. And while Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side did attempt to chase the game, Watford also had chances to add to their tally and deserved only their third league victory ever over United.

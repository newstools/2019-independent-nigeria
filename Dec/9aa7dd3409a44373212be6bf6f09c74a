ASABA – Vanguard for Transparent Leadership and Democracy (VATLAD) has condemned the National Working Committee of People’s Democratic Party (PDP) for extending its suspension of Ndidu Elumelu and six other members of the PDP of the House of Representatives. The condemnation may not be unconnected with the controversy that trailed the announcement of Minority Leaders of the 9th House by Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila. Igbini Emmanuel, National President, VATLAD described the actions of the NWC of PDP as illegal and unconstitutional. He said the Gbajabiamila-led House has been in gross violation of the constitutional Rights guaranteed by section 60 of the 1999 Nigerian Constitution, as amended, and correspondingly by Order 7, Rules 8 – 12 of the Standing Orders of the House of Representatives to freely and independently nominate from among them, members of PDP and other Minority political parties their Minority Leader, Minority Whip, Deputy Minority Leader and Deputy Minority Whip. Similarly, he posited that the recent decision of Gbajabiamila-led leadership of the House to retaliate by entertaining and approving for investigation and sanction, an incurably defective motion on privilege moved by Ben Igbakpa, a PDP member of the House on November 6, 2019, alleging breach of collective and individual privileges of all members of the House of Representatives by Chinda Kingsley and three other members of PDP who are recognised by the PDP as the duly nominated Minority Leaders of the House should also be condemned. “These actions of PDP and Speaker have so far been principally responsible for division within the minority political parties and the resultant failure of the once very vibrant and patriotic House of Representatives to ensure peace, order and good governance, and respect for human rights and rule of law in the Federal Republic of Nigeria.” “We, therefore, want to restate for the record and unequivocally that the PDP or any political party of Nigeria has no constitutional power to question let alone sanction any elected legislator for any decision or action taken by any elected member of their political parties in the Legislature in carrying out legislative businesses of the National Assembly which includes the election of Presiding Officers or nomination of Majority or Minority leaders, respectively”. “The political parties can only influence, lobby or persuade their members to present and execute the lawful agenda of the political parties at the National Assembly, which also includes the emergence of Presiding and Principal Officers of the National Assembly” On how to resolve the lingering crisis as to who the members of PDP and other minority parties of the House truly nominated as the minority leaders, PDP being a overwhelming majority among the Minority Political Parties in the House should mobilise its members in the House of Representatives to invoke their Legislative power under Order 7 Rule 13 to change the Elumelu-led Minority Leadership. According to him, the Rule of the House of Representatives states clearly that: “After due notice to the House, the Majority Party and the Minority Parties may change their Leader and Whip, Deputy Leader and Deputy Whip, provided that the change is made by majority of the members of the parties in the House themselves.” “This process should be encouraged to be transparent and credible as it will finally put to rest, the claim and counter-claim over Minority Leadership of the House” “Secondly, the ongoing investigation of the motion moved by Ibakpa seeking sanction on Chinda and three others for presenting themselves as PDP Caucus Leaders of the House should immediately be discontinued by the House as the Motion and alleged actions are purely a PDP internal affairs and in no way affect APC and other political parties in the House of Representatives. This fact therefore robs the House of the Jurisdiction to interfere let alone seek to sanction Chinda and others”

ADO-EKITI – The Bishop of Ekiti Oke Diocese, Anglican Communion, Reverend Isaac Olubowale, has stressed the need for Nigerian leaders to always use their positions to better the lots of poor and the deprived.
The bishop spoke on Saturday at Saint Michael’s Anglican Church, Oye Ekiti, during the funeral ceremony of Madam Felicia Arise, the mother of former federal lawmaker, who represented Ekiti North Senatorial District at the Senate, Senator Ayo Arise.
The cleric also urged them to be wary of their actions and imbibe the culture of honesty and selfless service for them to escape destruction on the judgement day.
According to him, there is no escape route for any bad leader on the judgment, warning that they shall be made to account for their actions and the way they presided over humanity.
Olubowale stated that leaders must be circumspect of their actions, especially those that were connected with how they served humanity when opportunities were bestowed on them.
Olubowale described death as inevitable price that everyone must pay, irrespective of position or status, urging people, especially the leaders to always contribute to the growth of humanity and the nation at large when the chance beckons.
Speaking on the deceased’s virtues, the cleric commended the indelible footprints left by Mrs. Arise as a community, saying history will always remember her as one individual who served her people well during her lifetime.
“We shall all be judged accordingly by God. We must be wary of how we live our lives. You will account for all your deeds.
“If God gives you opportunity as a leader, don’t misuse it. Be nice and kind to humanity. Don’t be wicked and believe that the world is ephemeral. Don’t be a saboteur and help your people to overcome poverty.”

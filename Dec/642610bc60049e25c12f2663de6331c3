Dr Olufemi Oke-Osanyintolu, Director-General, Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), has said the agency had started demolition of distressed buildings in Lagos Island with the three-storey building located at Bamigbose Street. Oke-Osanyintolu who disclosed this in an interview with newsmen during the demolition in Lagos on Saturday, said the three-storey building located at 54 Bamgbose Street was in a state of distress with visible cracking on different parts of the house. Oke-Osanyintolu said that another distressed building on the same street was also brought down to ground zero on December 11. He said the owners had already removed the roof of the second building located at 52 Bamgbose Street to persuade tenants to vacate the property. Oke-Sanyintoult said before the agency carried out the demolition, the Lagos State Building Control Agency (LASBCA), the Material Testing Agency and Ministry of Urban and Physical Planning had made their recommendations to the government. “The ministry’s recommendations are necessary to carry out stress tests to ascertain the integrity of the building. After thorough investigations, the ministry agreed that the houses should be taken to ground zero. “Consequently, the residents of the building were advised to vacate the premises within five days for their safety,” he said.

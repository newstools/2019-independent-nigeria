LAGOS â€“ Rangers International of Enugu seem to be going a rough part as they started their campaign at the group stage of the 2019 ACF Confederation Cup on a losing note capitulating 1-3 at home to Egyptian side, Pyramid Football Club. The Flying Antelopes took the lead in the 29th minute through Ibrahim Olawoyin who took a very fine strike to put his side in the driving seat. The Egyptians pressed forward but could not level the score in the first half as it ended with the home side leading with the 1-0. However, at the restart, the visitors piled the pressure and were rightly rewarded with an equalizer in the 55th minute through a well-taking spot kick converted by Mohamed Salama. The Flying Antelopes were reduced to 10 men after Tope Alabi, captain of the side, received his second booking of the evening and was summarily sent off. Afterwards, it was the Egyptians that were dictating the pace of the game, forcing Rangers to go back to defend. It was, however, a decision that backfired as the Egyptian cup holders scored two further goals to nail the Flying Antelopes.

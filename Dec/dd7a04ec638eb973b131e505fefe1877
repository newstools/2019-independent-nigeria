LAGOS – After losing their respective opening games at the group stage of the 2019 CAF Confederation Cup, Nigerian remaining campaigners in the continent, Enyimba International and Rangers, had mixed results in their match-day two on Sunday. Recall that Rangers fell 1-3 at home to Pyramids of Egypt during their first group game of the 2019 CAF Confederation Cup. The result led to the sack of interim manager, Benedict Ugwu and the appointment of Sylvanus Okpala. But playing away to another Egyptian side, Al Masry, the Flying Antelopes put every foot wrong and were hammered 4-2, as they risk early elimination from the second tier club competition. Consequently, the Flying Antelopes are rooted at the four-team group with no point after two rounds of matches. For Enyimba, they played their first game away to Moroccan side, Hassania Union Sport Agadir (HUSA) where they lost 2-0. But the Peoples Elephants came back in their match-day two with a slim 1-0 win over Cote d’Ivoire side, San Pedro. Enyimba, two-time African Champions League winners, remain the first and only Nigerian club to have won the premier African club competition after they conquered the continent in 2003 and 2004.

Ughelli – The people of Okpeleama community, Gbaramatu Kingdom in Warri South West Local Government Area of Delta State, have called on the Niger Delta Development Commission (NNDC) to re-award the Okpeleama shoreline protection and reclamation project to save the community from being eroded away by the sea. A statement by signed by Mr. Monday Aboh, chairman and Princewill Donju, secretary of the community, said the contract for the Okpeleama shoreline protection and reclamation was awarded in 2005 by the NDDC to First Marine and Engineering Company and it mobilized to site in the year 2006. It explained that not long after the contractor mobilized to site in the year 2006, the project which was and still dear to the heart of the community was abandoned without any reasonable justification. They said a series of meetings was scheduled by the commission between the community and the contractor, but the contractor never showed up at any of the meetings. “But to add salt to injury, the contractor mobilized members of the Joint Tax Force (JTF) to the community on the 17th of May, 2013 at about 5am without any pre-informing the leadership of the community and unleashed terror on members of the community and carted away his equipment without completing the job, leaving the site worse than he met it,” they added. They appealed to the NDDC board to investigate and bring to book every person found responsible for the abandonment of the project for which huge taxpayers’ money had been expended.

LAGOS – Chief Olabode George, a former Deputy National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has said there is no need x-raying President Muhammadu Buhari’s performance in the last five years, as both the President and his wife, Aisha Buhari, have admitted that there is serious hunger in the country. Speaking in an interview with Daily Independent, George said having admitted that people are suffering; Nigerians are anxiously waiting for how President Buhari will proffer a solution to the hunger crisis. “The President has accepted that there is hunger in the land and how to resolve that is what we are interested in. In the military, you don’t write a confidential report about your boss, we came from the same military background.” “But all I will say is, all is still not well. I have quoted Buhari where he said there is hunger in the land, now I want to quote his wife, Aisha Buhari. “She said, ‘My husband has three years to go. We should fasten our seatbelts, get up and do the needful or we will all regret it very soon because at the rate at which things are going, things are completely out of hand. People cannot afford potable drinking water in this country. We have ministers and we have governors what are they doing? “She only talked about water, of course water is everything; but what about food? So, what else do I have to say?” George also implored Nigerians to forget about their ethnic, religious and political differences and join hands in addressing the myriads of challenges facing the country. “I think the issue has gone beyond political party A or B. It should be the concern of every committed Nigerian. We should remove this stupid toga of Yoruba, Hausa, Igbo or South- West, North or South East. In every community and every tribe, we have the good, bad and ugly. Culturally we may differ but we are basically human beings. All these division is what is inhibiting the development of this country,” he said.

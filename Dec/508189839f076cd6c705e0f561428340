Frank Lampard has reportedly made an attacker his top priority in the January transfer window and a shortlist of six forwards has been compiled for Chelsea chiefs to target. The likes of Borussia Dortmund ace Jadon Sancho and Crystal Palace’s Wilfried Zaha are on the west London side’s radar, although it’s accepted a January deal will be difficult to push through. Bayer Leverkusen winger Leon Bailey and Villarreal wide man Samuel Chukwueze are perhaps more realistic targets to secure in the winter transfer window. Sancho remains on Chelsea’s radar Strikers Timo Werner and Moussa Dembele are also being tracked, but their participation in the last-16 of the Champions League with their respective clubs Red Bull Leipzig – who face Tottenham Hotspur – and Lyon, who meet Juventus, would likely throw a spanner in the works. However, Lampard has recognised the need to bring in new attacking options to bolster his side’s chances against Champions League opponents Bayern Munich, according to The Telegraph. Having failed to score against Bournemouth and West Ham in recent home matches, the Blues legend believes he needs more unpredictability at his disposal. Olivier Giroud and Pedro Rodriguez could both be moved on in January to create space for any new signing, but Lampard is expected to have a £150million warchest at his disposal regardless.

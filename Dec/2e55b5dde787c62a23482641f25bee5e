ABEOKUTA – President Muhammadu Buhari has described the death of Nigeria’s foremost woman politician, Titilayo Ajanaku, as “a major loss to Nigeria’s democratic struggles because her roles in those struggles cannot be forgotten in a hurry.” In a condolence message by one of his spokesmen, Malam Garba Shehu, in Abuja on Saturday, Buhari said the late Ajanaku would be fondly remembered as an energetic woman politician who made a name for herself in the struggle to establish democratic order in Nigeria. Also, Senator representing Ogun Central, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, has mourned the first local government chairperson in the country, Mrs Ajanaku, describing her as a trailblazer who fought for women emancipation in Nigeria. Amosun, accompanied by former Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Alhaji Sarafa Tunji Ishola, and other aides, paid a condolence visit to Ajanaku’s residence in Abeokuta, the state capital. Ajanaku, a founding member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) died in the early hours of Thursday, ages 73.

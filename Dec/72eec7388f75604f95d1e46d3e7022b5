A huge game at the foot of the Premier League takes place at St Mary’s this weekend as 18th placed Southampton host struggling West Ham. With just one point separating the two sides in the table, a win for the Saints would see them leapfrog their opponents – who sit 16th – and really put the strain on under-fire manager Manuel Pellegrini. Despite a promising start to the season, West Ham have experienced an alarming slide towards the relegation zone in recent weeks following a poor run of form. Defeat here may spell the end of the Chilean’s tenure in east London. Southampton meanwhile won two home games in the space of four days recently to briefly lift themselves out of the bottom three, before defeat at Newcastle left them in the drop zone once more. Southampton will be without full-back Yan Valery, who has been ruled out of the clash with a virus. However, Saints are hopeful that Stuart Armstrong could make a return to action – the midfielder having not featured since suffering a hamstring injury against Arsenal in November. Sofiane Boufal is still struggling with a toe problem, and although not fit enough to start, the midfielder is expected to make the squad. West Ham are still contending with a number of injuries to their first team. Jack Wilshere remains sidelined with a groin injury, and although Lukasz Fabianski and Manuel Lanzini are on the road to recovery from their respective hip and shoulder injuries, the pair will not be fit for Saturday’s encounter. Aaron Cresswell was forced to come off during the Hammers’ Monday night defeat to Arsenal after picking up a knock, but the left back has been training fully all week and is expected to be available.

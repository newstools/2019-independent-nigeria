UGHELLI – Mr. Larry Otu, managing director of Lym Consults Nigeria Limited, has challenged the Executive Director of Opeans Nigeria Limited, Mr. Ben Obi Nwoye, whose company, Opeans Nigeria Limited was allegedly sealed up by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) recently to display his International Association of Drilling Contractors (IADC) accreditation for all to see, insisting that Opeans Nigeria Limited was not IADC approved. It would be recalled that Dr. Ben Nwoye , last week debunked the alleged sealing of its Warri training centre by operatives of the EFCC. Nwoye described the allegation against the company as frivolous and lacks any iota of truth, explaining that the company’s staff arrested by operatives of the anti-graft agency have been released. However, Otu in a chat with DAILY INDEPENDENT on Monda y, reiterated his accusation of the management of Opeans Nigeria Limited of issuing fake IADC certificates. Commenting on the issue of EFCC investigating Opeans Nigeria Limited over the IADC certificate forgery, Otu said; “Me or any other training provider, or the DPR who now know that Ben Nwoye and Opeans Nigeria Limited are issuing forged and fraudulent IADC certificates and defrauding millions of Naira from Oil and Gas workers could have petitioned the EFCC. “We all know the position of President Buhari and the current leadership of the EFCC on corruption. The issues that bother on corruption and fraud are not handled with kit gloves. If Ben Nwoye and Opeans Nigeria Limited truly have IADC Accreditation to offer BOSIET, HUET and SAS trainings, which they have been doing for years, they should not be crying on the pages of newspaper or social media, they should simply display their ‘IADC Accreditation’ for all to see. “I am emphatic that Opeans Nigeria Limited does not have any IADC Accreditation, neither have they ever been accredited by IADC for any course or program to issue any certificate.

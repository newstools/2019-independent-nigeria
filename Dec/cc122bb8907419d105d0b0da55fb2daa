BallonD’or award is set to take place today, and Lionel Messi, Virgil Van Dijk and C.ronaldo were nominated for the award. The Liverpool centre-back has won the Champions League and completely transformed the Reds’ defence. Messi continues to defy belief, most recently with a superb late winner in Barcelona’s 1-0 victory over Atletico Madrid last night. The expectation is that it’s going to be Messi for a record sixth time, finally eclipsing Cristiano Ronaldo. Football fans have taken to twitter to choose their favourite to win the award.

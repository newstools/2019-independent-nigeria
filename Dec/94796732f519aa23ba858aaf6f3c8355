LAGOS – Prince Dapo Abiodun, Ogun State governor, has urged intending pilgrims to Israel to see the journey as a spiritual exercise where their personal spirituality would be increased. The governor gave the charge during a farewell service organised by the state’s Christian Pilgrims Welfare Board for the 2019 intending pilgrims at the Oba’s Complex, Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta, stressing that the essence of the pilgrimage was for further spiritual awakening. Abiodun, who was represented by Noimot Salako-Oyedele, his deputy, urged the pilgrims to obey constituted authorities, be good ambassadors of the state, be their brother’s keepers and desist from acts capable of tarnishing their images, the state and the nation. “”I will like you to take advantage of this life time journey, let it not be a waste, but an opportunity to develop spiritually. I want to urge you all to also intensify prayers for our government, in order to deliver good governance to the people of the State,” he said. Bishop Akintunde Akin-Akinsanya, Chairman, Christian Association Nigeria (CAN), Ogun State chapter, in his exhortation, described Jerusalem as a place where people would connect to their spiritual roots, noting that the holy land would give pilgrims ample opportunities to feel the past, as well as connect to the future. He admonished the pilgrims not to see the journey as a jamboree or a shopping spree, rather, seize the opportunity to prepare for the heavenly Jerusalem.

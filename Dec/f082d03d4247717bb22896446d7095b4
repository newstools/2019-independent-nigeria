The founder and leader of Zoe Outreach Embassy, Pastor Kelvin Kwesi Kobiri, has been sighted in a video been heckled by a group of people claiming to have their investment locked up with him. The aggrieved customers of Tikowre capital in the video going viral were seen attacking and humiliating the pastor to demand a refund on their locked up investment, according to reports by Ghana Base and video uploaded by Adom TV.  According to the aggrieved members, they were convinced by the founder and leader of the Zoe Outreach Embassy church, Pastor Kelvin Kwesi Kobiri to invest with EL Real Estates and Tikowrie Capital; but have not been able to withdraw their dividends or principal since November 2018. The man of God, according to reports, arrived at the premises of the Tarkwa Circuit Court to respond to a suit against him for allegedly issuing three dud checks. However, the court could not sit because the judge was reported to be on vacation. When word spread around that Pastor Kobiri was in town, some angry customers dragged him out of his white Range Rover vehicle into the courtyard to demand their lockup funds. But for the intervention of armed policemen from the Tarkwa Divisional Police Command who whisked him away, Pastor Kobiri would have been beaten to a pulp.

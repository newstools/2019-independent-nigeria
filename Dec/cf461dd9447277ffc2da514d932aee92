A cyber fraudster Onyebuchi Nwalozie Julius has been arrested by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, for allegedly impersonating the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele. Wilson Uwujaren, Head, Media and Publicity of the agency, disclosed to Daily Independent at the weekend that Nwalozie, a native of Ngor-Okpala in Imo State, who claimed to be involved into estate management, confessed under interrogation, that he impersonated the CBN governor with email account: emefilegodwin586@yahoo.com and defrauded one Mr. Omar Es Sh Deeb. The suspect, whose specialty was Business Email Compromise BEC, said his modus operandi involved searching for email addresses via Google search and sending emails to prospective victims. Nwalozie was arrested on December 6, 2019 in Owerri in Imo State. At the point of his arrest, the following items were recovered from him: A HP Laptop Envy with serial number CND62544TZ; HP Laptop with serial number SCD8022CSF; iPhone X; Nokia phone, ECOWAS International Passport-55389766, driverâ€™s licence and a car with registration No. LSR 23 FQ. An analysis of his laptop revealed a number of scam mails he sent to Deeb with bogus contract proposals purported to have emanated from CBN, while he posed as CBN Governor. Onyebuchi successfully defrauded Deeb, who remitted funds, thinking he was actually dealing with Emefiele. Though Onyebuchi confessed to have benefited as much as N4.5million from his criminal enterprise, investigation into the scam continues.

The Director-General, International Labour Organisation (ILO), Guy Ryder, has called on African countries to seize the opportunities that exist on the continent to advance towards a human-centred future of work. He made the call at the opening of the ILO’s 14th African Regional Meeting in Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire, which brings together the ILO’s tripartite constituents representing governments, workers and employers from 54 African countries. Ryder referred to projections for economic growth in Africa that are higher than the global average; a ‘demographic dividend’ that will see labour force numbers rising to 60 per cent; the continent’s unique potential for creating renewable energy; and opportunities for development that could be opened up by advances in technology. “Africa has every reason to regard the future with confidence. Young, rich in resources, dynamic and creative, it offers possibilities which in many ways, do not exist in other regions. However, as always, there are challenges”. Among these is the need to create twenty-six million jobs every year in Africa to meet the objectives of the UN Sustainable Development Goals . Other challenges, he said, include a social protection financing gap amounting to 68 billion US dollars a year; economic, social and migratory pressures; and the impact of climate change and globalisation. “What we seek is a future of work with social justice as the surest guarantee we can have of peace and prosperity in African and in the world. This is the unfinished business of our 100 year old Organization which we must take forward together, he said The meeting will be reviewing the progress made in implementing the ILO’s Decent Work Agenda and charting a course towards a future with decent work in the region.

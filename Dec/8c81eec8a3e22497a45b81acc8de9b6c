A former Minister of State for Works and governorship aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress in Edo State, Mr Chris Ogienmwonyi, on Wednesday said the party’s National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, should be commended for his service to the party and not be removed. Ogienmwonyi’s comment is coming on the heel of Monday’s call for Oshiomhole’s resignation by the state chairman of the party, Mr Anselm Ojezua. He said agreed with the position of the leadership of the South-South APC which said. “It would resist any attempt by forces within the party that are working to remove Adams Oshiomhole as the national chairman of the party.” Ogienmwonyi told party supporters that ‘‘Oshiomhole is a role model’’ that every Nigerian should emulate. “As the architect of modern democracy in Edo State, who made history by leading an opposition party for seven years in the state and then retaining power at the centre, he must be commended,” he said.

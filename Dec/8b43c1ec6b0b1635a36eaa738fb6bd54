Tottenham will be without four players for the trip to Old Trafford on Wednesday night. Jose Mourinho will be returning to Manchester United for the first time since his sacking in December last year. Mourinho took over from Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham just under two weeks ago and has already overseen an upturn in form. Spurs have risen to fifth in the Premier League table, courtesy of back-to-back wins, and confirmed their place in the last 16 of the Champions League too. United on the other hand have only won once in the last four league games and the pressure on Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s shoulders has intensified as a result. Not that Solskjaer is concerned. He said: “No it doesn’t make me more concerned, I’m just focusing on my job and that’s doing as well as I can, look forward to next game, look long-term plan things with board.” Mourinho would love nothing more than to add to United’s woes by taking all three points back to north London on Wednesday night, but he will have to do so without four players. Tottenham have confirmed their team news for the trip to Old Trafford, with four players missing the journey. Goalkeepers Hugo Lloris and Michel Vorm remain out with elbow and calf injuries respectively, while left-back Ben Davies is missing with an ankle injury. Argentinian midfielder Erik Lamela has also failed to recover from his hamstring injury in time for the game at Old Trafford.

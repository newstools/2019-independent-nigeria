GOMBE – Governor Muhammad Inuwa Yahaya of Gombe State has promised to construct at least 100 kilometres of roads in each of the eleven Local Government Areas of the state. The governor made the pledge at the flagging off of 15 kilometers Sambo-daji-Pindikola, Gwaram-Garin Wada road in Akko LGA of the state. He said his administration was poised to strategically construct no fewer than 100 kilometers of roads in all the 11 Local Government Areas of the state to address some of the needs of the rural populace. According to him, “this is part of fulfilling my campaign promises to provide quality infrastructure that will last for years. We are also using indigenous contractors so that our people will be empowered.” He called on the people to support the administration by taking good care of the projects that were meant to serve them. Earlier, Commissioner for Works and Transport, Abubakar Bappa, said the project which had been awarded to a reputable construction company, Grow Scope Nigeria Limited, was expected to complete the work within 18 months. The governor also inspected facilities at the Government Girls Science Secondary School, Kumo, Akko LGA where he planted a tree and promised to close the gap of infrastructural deficit in public schools by providing more amenities. Principal of the school, Hajiya Gimbiya Samaila, told the governor that the capacity of the school, established over eight years ago to accommodate only 500 students, had been grossly overstretched as it now accommodates 1,800 students with only 28 teachers.

OSOGBO – A human rights lawyer and former chairman of the Nigeria Bar Association (NBA), Ilesa, Osun State, Barrister Kanmi Ajibola, has petitioned the United Nations (UN) and other international organisations, including Economic Community of West Africa (ECOWAS) over persistent disobedience to court orders by President Muhammadu Buhari’s government. In a letter addressed to the UN Secretary General, Ajibola a copy made available to DAILY INDEPENDENT, urged the international bodies to mount pressure on Buhari to obey court orders and allow full operation of the rule of law. Part of the letter dated December 16 titled, ‘Re: injustice here is a mark of injustice everywhere’, reads, “For several decades, Nigeria was ruled by military dictators, during which the political and human rights of Nigerians were manacled until May 29, 1999 when the country returned to democratic rule. “From 29th May 1999 to 28th May of 2015, the Federal Government of Nigeria disobedience to court orders was not undauntedly conspicuous if any. “On the 29th May 2015, President Muhammadu Buhari was sworn in as the president and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, and re-elected and sworn in for another four year term on the 29th day of May 2019. “Since the ascendancy of President Muhammadu Buhari to the Nigeria presidency, he has treated the rule of law and orders of competent Courts with unprecedented despise and disdain. “In the almost five years of Buhari’s governance he has Disobeyers over forty orders of competent Courts within the Nigerian and ECOWAS jurisdictions.” Ajibola cited cases which involved Dasuki, El Zakzaky, Sowore, Shagari and Labinjo as some of the matters Buhari’s administration had repeatedly shunned courts’ pronouncements granting their bails.

Mikel Arteta will seek to get his first win as Arsenal manager when they host Chelsea in their next Premier League game as his reign began with a draw as Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s 12th Premier League goal of the season earned the Gunners a 1-1 draw at Bournemouth. However, Carlo Ancelloti kicked off his reign at Everton with win as they beat Burnley 1-0 on Thursday.

Bournemouth had opened scoring on 35th minute when Dan Gosling with a close range finish. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Reacting to the draw, Aubameyang said in a post-match, “We missed a lot of chances in the second half. We should get the three points today but that can happen. I think the attitude of the boys was great but we have to improve our chances. “He [Mikel Arteta] told us to continue in the same way [at half-time], to try to play, respect our plan, that was working and that was it. Everybody was working hard, we were aggressive and trying to play as he likes. Hopefully we will try to improve. We know the next games are quite hard but we are confident.” It was a sad tale for Chelsea that lost 2-0 at Stamford Bridge to Southampton. Southampton goalscorer Nathan Redmond said, “I think it’s wrong for us to go into the game and expect anything. We did the ground work today and it sounds a cliche but we earned the right to be in the game. We have been working on a system that works for us about when we can keep the ball land when we can attack. We executed the game plan so to come away with the three points is the best feeling.” In other games, Aston Villa beat Norwich City 1-0, while Crystal Palace beat West Ham 2-1 at home.Sheffied United and Watford played 1-1.

LAGOS – Amidst the seeming tensed atmosphere generated by the contract issues of Coach Gernot Rohr and the continued silence of the Nigerian Football Federation (NFF), a call has gone to the leadership of the football house and football administrators to make sure that there is harmony in the system for the interest of the game itself. Speaking to DAILY INDEPENDENT, Rafiu Ladipo, the President of the Nigerian Boxing Board of Control (NBB of O), who is also the President General of the Nigerian Football and Other Sports Supporters Club (NFOSSC), gave the charge, while also saying that any friction between the NFF leadership and coach, Rohr, would affect the country’s quest to qualify for the 2021 AFCON in Cameroon. “Any controversy or issues will affect the team, the coaches, the administrators and even the players and the games themselves. I will advise that whatever the disagreement, it should be settled right away so that we can face the AFCON. “This is because something that may be seen to be small can cause untold damages to aspirations. I think if the coach or his employers are not settled, it will definitely impact on the team badly.” The Super Eagles have won two qualifiers in as many games so far. They defeated their Benin Republic counterparts 2-1 in Uyo before travelling to Maseru to also beat Lesotho, thus holding comfortably in the group that also has Sierra Leone.

The Nigeria Employers’ Consultative Association (NECA)has expressed concern at the recent resolution by the Senate to the effect that Government should start paying stipends to unemployed Nigerians till they are able to get any kind of employment. Timothy Olawale, the Director-General of NECA, in a chat with our correspondent yesterday in Lagos, stated that “though the resolution of the Senate seems plausible as the implementation might increase the disposable income of unemployed youths and stimulate consumption. “It also has the potential to reduce social malaise and the general hopelessness pervading the ranks of the youths. However, there are fundamental issues that should be addressed before the implementation”, he said While shedding light on the fundamentals critical to the success of the programme, the NECA Director General, averred that “one critical success factor is the availability of accurate data. It is important to know the number of Nigerians that are actually unemployed to forestall the programme becoming another scheme bedevilled with patronage”. “Also of importance is the funding and administration of the Project. The Project was not captured in the already passed 2020 Appropriation Bill, thus it is worrisome where the funds to bankroll it will come from. It is hoped that Government will not further burden the already overtaxed private businesses”, he said. Olawale specifically noted that “so far, all the social intervention programmes has been cosmetics and short-term in nature without potential to solve the real issues of unemployment. Government at all levels must take a more than cursory look at the Private sector.

Sudan’s transitional government resumed peace talks on Tuesday evening in Juba, South Sudan capital, with various armed opposition groups that fought against the regime of former President Omar al-Bashir. Mohamed Hamdan Daqlu, deputy head of the Sudan Transitional Council, said they aim to reach a comprehensive peace agreement with the opposition groups under the Sudan Revolutionary Front (SRF) led by El Hadi Idris, leader of the Sudan Liberation Army. “We will focus on the talks seriously in order to reach a comprehensive peace agreement with the opposition. We will work together to allow people displaced and refugees to return to their homes,” said Daqlu during the opening of the second round of talks in Juba. The first round of direct peace talks being mediated by South Sudan President Salva Kiir commenced on October 14. However, later allegations of a military attack on a Sudanese rebel group suspended peace negotiations. Tut Kew Gatluak, head of South Sudan mediation team, expressed optimism that the parties will finally ink a peace deal ending decades of conflict in the marginalised regions of Darfur, Blue Nile and South Kordofan. “We hope to achieve peace in the shortest time possible. What is important is freedom and security in Sudan,” said Gatluak.

ABUJA – The Presidential Support Committee (PSC) has said that the award conferred on the Executive Secretary of Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund), Prof Elias Suleiman Bogoro by Leadership Group Limited, as the Public Service Person of the Year 2019, is a well-deserved honour. PSC, in a statement by its Director of Communication and Strategic Planning, Mallam Gidado Ibrahim, described the award conferred by the media organisation as a testimony to the arduous work Bogoro is doing at TETFund in promoting transparency and accountability in the conduct of public affairs in Nigeria. Stating that the award was a well-deserved one, the PSC noted that focus has been the secret of numerous achievements recorded by Bogoro since taking over at TETFund and that he has justified the confidence reposed in him by turning around the story of Nigeria’s public tertiary institution within the shortest time. PSC said: “The award conferred on Prof Suleiman Elias Bogoro’s explains his re-appointment on the April 21, 2019 by President Muhammadu Buhari. The president knew that he was all that is needed to revamp the ailing fortune of education sector in Nigeria, which has been on the downward trend in the last few decades. “The president’s decision to recall him was definitely informed by the confidence he has in the capacity and track records of the erudite scholar to rescue the nation’s education system. So far, with his humble, calm and calculative mien, Prof Bogoro has continued to prove his critics wrong”.

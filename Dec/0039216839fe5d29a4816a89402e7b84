ABEOKUTA – A youth-based organisation, Waleskingdom Capital, has donated protective jackets, including raincoats, rain boots and police sheds to the Ogun State Police Command as part of its Cooperation Social Responsibility (CSR). The organisation, founded by a young entrepreneur, Jaiyeoba Daniel Wales, said the gesture was part of their community development and nation building agenda. Speaking during a brief ceremony at the police headquarters in Eleweran, Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, Jaiyeola said the gesture was part of the resolve of the organisation to reduce overdependence on government. Jaiyeoba said they elected to support the Ogun State Police Command with the donated equipment in recognition of its onerous task of securing lives and property in the state. He also explained that the gesture was to pass a message to both the youths and police community that not every youth organisation engaged in fraudulent activities like internet fraud. The state Commissioner of Police, Kenneth Ebrimson, who received the items from the organisation, assured that the police would keep the state safe for the law abiding residents and visitors during and after the yuletide. Kenneth advised the youths to channel their energies into worthwhile ventures and shun cultism, robbery and cybercrime if they aspired to be useful to themselves, family, society and the nation. The police boss noted that partnership, cooperation and support from members of the public would not only boost the morale of the Police but also help towards achieving crimes – free society. He lauded Jaiyeoba and his colleagues for their kind gesture, saying it should be emulated by other youths, even as he assured that the police would use the items judiciously.

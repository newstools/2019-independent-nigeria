Akure â€“ The new Commandant of Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Ondo State Command, Phillip Ayuba has warned all vandals to steer off all government installations in the state. Ayuba stated this yesterday after taking over the mantle of control of the command from Christiana Abiakam-Omaru, who assumed office in the command in February 2019. After signing the handover note, the new commandant noted that criminals usually get more desperate during yuletide because they want to make money at all cost, charging the officers and men to be dutiful and diligent in order to enhance productivity and efficient service delivery. He also encouraged the officers and men at the State Headquarters, Area Commands and those deployed to various Local Governments across the state to be tactful and efficient in intelligence and information gathering; safeguarding of all critical national assets and infrastructure; monitoring of private guard company; disaster and crisis management in the state, among others. Ayuba, who was transferred from Bayelsa State, called on the people of Ondo State to be more security-conscious, advising them to report any suspicious movement in their areas to security agencies. In her valedictory address, the outgoing Commandant appreciated the men and officers of the Command for their support and assistance. She ascribed her successful operations while in the state to collective efforts of officers and men of the Command. Abiakam-Omaru charged them to extend similar support and assistance to her successor. The new commandant, however, stated that concerted effort by security agencies in the country is sacrosanct to security of life and property.

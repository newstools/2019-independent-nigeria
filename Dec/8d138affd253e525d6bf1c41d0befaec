ADO-EKITI â€“ The Planter Christ Apostolic Church (CAC), Grace of Mercy Prayer Mountain (GMPM), Adamimogo Outreach, Prophet Sam Olu Alo, has said that 70 percent of the crises bedevelling Nigeria emanated from the religious houses, particularly the churches and mosques. Speaking on Sunday during the annual empowerment programme for widows and less-privileged residents of Ekiti State, the cleric said that the absence of true teachings of the scriptures in both two major religious had led people astray. Over 650 widows went home with food stuffs and cash, 35 secondary school students got 50 thousand naira for their WAEC fees. School bags and lunch bags were distributed to 250 students, 300 pupils got 1,400 exercise books and another 265 students received 1,200 big note books. Working tools like grinding machines and driers were also given to deserving beneficiaries at the event. Lamenting the state of affairs in the nation, Prophet Alo remarked that there is no leader in Nigeria today who does not go to either church or mosque, stressing that failure of religion to impact on their attitudes towards humanity spoke volume on the manner of messages being preached. According to him, the transformation our nation begins from the churches, mosques and every other religious places. Prophet Alo said there is need for all religious leaders and bodies to get involved in humanitarian and philanthropic ventures to bring about the much desired transformation in the country.

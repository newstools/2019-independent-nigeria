ABUJA – The Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG) has said gender equality is key to sustainable growth in Nigeria. NESG, which is Nigeria’s leading think tank, had initiated the NESG Community of Practice (CoP) on Gender. According to a United Nations (2017) report, “advancing gender equality is smart economics, sound business practice and essential development policy. “When women and men have equal opportunities to shape their own lives and contribute to their families, communities and countries, it leads to enhanced productivity, improved development outcomes and better performance by business and institutions.” However, the 2019 WEF Global Gender Gap report ranked Nigeria 132 out of 149 in bridging the gender gap, a poor performance on a world-wide scale. In his opening remarks, Niyi Yusuf, Vice Chairman, NESG, stated that over time, the NESG had noticed that issues relating to some large stakeholder groups such as Gender, Youth and SME may not be optimally resolved within the Policy Commissions structure which it operates, because these issues cut across all of them. Therefore, the think tank has set up Communities of Practice to tackle these central issues that will guarantee a sustainable and vibrant Nigerian economy by the year 2050. “A Community of Practice is a group of people (typically across different organisations) that share a concern or passion for a common goal and work together to achieve the said goal,” Yusuf said. Delivering a presentation on the Gender Community of Practice, Head, and Corporate Services at NESG, Mrs. Nkechi Onyenso, stated that the approach for NESG Gender CoP would allow key stakeholders/individuals across private and public sector groups collectively own and champion the issues around women through the NESG’s structured approach of deliberating, agreeing and advocating on policy focal points.

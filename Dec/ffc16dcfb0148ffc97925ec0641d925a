Prices of fresh tomatoes which soared during Christmas celebrations, witnessed a sharp fall after the merriment of which many of the traders ascribed to improved supply coupled with low patronage. With low demand for the produce, by consumers owing to the fact that a large number of them had done their purchases the eve of the celebrations, despite the hike in prices, traders had no option than to reduce the price to avoid huge losses since fresh tomatoes is a perishable item. The same could not be mentioned for that of fresh pepper as prices of the produce skyrocketed the more after the celebrations due to unavailability.

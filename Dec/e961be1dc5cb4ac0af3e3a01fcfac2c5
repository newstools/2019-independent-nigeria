A Croatian court Monday found the head of Hungarian energy group MOL and Croatia’s former prime minister guilty of graft, marking the latest development in a nearly decade-long legal battle. Zsolt Hernadi was convicted of bribing former Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader to make MOL the primary decision-maker in the Croatian energy firm, INA. MOL is the biggest shareholder in the company. Hernadi was sentenced to two years in prison while Sanader was handed six years, local media reported. The ruling can still be appealed.

English Premier League giants Liverpool have step up their interest in French Ligue 1 outfit Lille’s star striker Victor Osimhen, as per Express Sport. The Nigeria international has been in prolific form for his current club in the ongoing campaign, where he has managed to score 13 goals along with providing four assists in just 24 appearances in all competitions. Those performances have not gone unnoticed and as per the latest report, the current European champions Liverpool have identified Osimhen as their number-one target for the mid-season transfer window in order to increase depth in the attacking unit for the rest of the campaign. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The Reds are currently leading the table in the Premier League and have qualified for the round-of-16 in the UEFA Champions League, where they will face Spanish club Atletico Madrid. The report further stated that Lille’s hierarchy are resigned to the fact that they will not be able to keep hold of their star player for long but are eager to keep the centre-forward at the club at least till the summer of 2020. Osimhen has joined Les Dogues in the summer of 2019 from Belgian club RSC Charleroi for a reported transfer fee of €12 million. Liverpool’s attacking unit is one of the most devastating in the world game and adding the Nigerian to boost strength in depth could be a sensible move.

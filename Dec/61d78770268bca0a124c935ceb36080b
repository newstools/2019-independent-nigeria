 LAGOS – The arrested officials are Tijani Jelili and Lukmon Ab­dullahi, chairman and PRO, respectively. No fewer than three vehi­cles belonging to their mem­bers
were impounded by the Lagos State officials. The officials of the Associ­ation of Limousine Bus Op­erators
(ALBO) alleged that the Lagos State taskforce was against their operations
because they were registered under the airport authority, rather than the Lagos
State government. The arrests and the sub­sequent industrial action by the
officials led to mas­sive chaos at the very bus stops leading to the air­port
as several passengers who had early morning flights had to take a long walk to
the airport, while others rode on motorbike in order not to miss their flights. Augustus Amonimo, sec­retary of ALBO, in an in­terview with
our correspon­dent, said: “Lagos State Task Force is seriously harassing us for
no reason. They feel they don’t want to see our blue buses but we are regis­tered
under the airport au­thority nationwide and not the state government.” As at the time of filing this report, the bus operators were
mobilising to embark on a protest against the al­leged injustice and had start­ed
calling out their members far and wide, demanding the release of their two
execu­tives. Buses were seen parked in their scores at the Lo­cal
Junction bus stop with a crowd of angry drivers chanting and getting riled up. “We wrote the Federal Air­ports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN)
to give us a place around Conoil and some of our people were there before the
task force came and im­pounded those three vehicles as well as whisked away our
chairman and PRO who came to intervene. “The worse is they were shooting sporadically as if the ALBO
were thieves. We will not operate until we get our people and get to the root
of the matter,” Omon­imo said.

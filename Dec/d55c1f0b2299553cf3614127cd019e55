Gauff amazed fans at Wimbledon 2019 by beating Slovenia’s Polona Hercog and Slovakia’s Magdale­na Rybarikova. The 15-year-old American started her Wimbledon journey with a stunning upset over five-time former champion Venus Williams in the first round. Coco became the youngest US Open girls singles finalist in 2017 aged just 13. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Last year, she won the French Open girls singles only two months after her 14th birthday. Gauff has said she was in­spired to play tennis by 23-time Grand Slam winner, Serena Wil­liams and her sister, Venus. “Serena is the reason why I play tennis and why my dad decided to get me a racket,” she said. “(My first memories) were of watching Serena playing at Wimbledon and she won, though I don’t remember which year, she has won so many times” Cori added. But the famous sisters have also become fans of the teenager. “She’s so cool. She’s a great girl. I love her dad. They’re just really cool people”, Serena said recently at a press conference. Her win against Venus Wil­liams means she becomes the youngest tennis player to win a match at Wimbledon since 1991 – when fellow American Jennifer Capriati, who was also 15, defeat­ed nine-time champion Martina Navratilova.

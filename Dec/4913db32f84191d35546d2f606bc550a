Approximately 20 terrorists and three soldiers were killed in two attacks on army positions in Burkina Faso, Xinhua news agency reported, quoting the country’s army in a statement on Tuesday. The attacks targeted military positions around 2 am local time (0200 GMT) in the northern Banh and northwestern Toeni localities, according to the statement, Bernama reports. Earlier on Sunday, gunmen attacked worshipers at a church, leaving at least 14 dead and several others injured in the country’s East region close to the border with Niger. Burkina Faso is faced with a worsening security situation in its northern regions, with almost daily attacks that have sparked a wave of panic in the country. Since 2015, terrorist attacks have claimed the lives of over 500 people, including 200 armed soldiers, and displaced thousands of others in the West African country.

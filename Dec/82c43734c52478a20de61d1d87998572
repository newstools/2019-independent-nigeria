After his longtime girlfriend passed away in February 2018, an elderly man in Jefferson County, Wisconsin, came home from the funeral to find a perplexing note stuck inside his front door. “I was here to pick up the stuff through Facebook,” it said. “I came in to the house and the items weren’t by the door. So I didn’t leave my money. I tried Facebook messaging you but you haven’t responded.” The message didn’t make much sense, the man’s son later told police, because he didn’t even have a cellphone or a computer. And it soon came to seem even more suspicious when the man looked inside his bedroom and found a cabinet open and his chequebook gone. More than a year later, detectives with the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office would link the crime to one of their own deputies. Authorities say that Janelle Gericke, who worked as a corrections officer at the Jefferson County Jail until July, scoured obituaries for funeral times and targeted the homes of grieving family members while they were attending memorial services. But her colleagues began spotting her as she staked out potential victims, and, on Tuesday, she was charged with burglary.

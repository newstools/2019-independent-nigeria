A Russian woman, Maria Khvostantseva, 22, has revealed how social media users urged her to kill her one-month-old baby, Vika, because she had birthmarks that covered 80 per cent of her body. According to Metro UK, Khvostantseva said the abuse came on the heels of her speaking out against a local priest, who had refused to baptise her baby, once he saw a picture of her, thinking she was infectious. Khvostantseva said she took a picture of Vika to a priest in the city of Kurgan in west-central Russia’s Kurgan Oblast, but he turned her away. Speaking on a TV programme, she said, “I got tons of messages and phone calls from strangers. They were insulting me and urging to kill my baby. A woman said to me by phone ‘kill your child. Throw it under a train.’” One of the vile messages Maria received read, “It’s better to die than to be like that.” Another said, ‘You should put it under acid rain.’ Russian police have since opened an investigation into the alleged abuse following Khvostantseva’s interview.

ABUJA – A vacation judge sitting at High Court of the Federal Capital Teritory in Maitama, Justice Othman Musa, Friday, gave the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) nod to remand a former Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Mohamed Adoke SAN, for 14 days pending investigation. Justice Musa made the order following an ex-parte motion moved the by EFCC’s lawyer, Fatima Mustapha. In a terse ruling, the court held that the, “Application to remand the suspect in EFCC custody for 14 days pending investigation is granted”. Adoke returned to the country yesterday after five years in self-exile only to be arrested on arrival by the EFCC at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport Abuja. Adoke’s predicament is not unconnected with the alleged role he played as Minister of Justice, in the controversial Oil Prospecting Licence 245 contract scam otherwise known as Malabu Oil deal. The EFCC had in 2017, pressed charges against Shell Nigeria Exploration Production Company Limited and 10 others, including Adoke and Nigeria Agip Exploration Limited. In the suit marked FCT/ HC/CR/124/17, the anti-graft agency had alleged that Adoke and the other defendants fraudulently allocated the Oil Prospecting Licence 245 otherwise known as Malabu Oil. They were also accused of other forms of offences involving the sum of about $1.2billion, forgery of bank documents, bribery and corruption. The alleged $1.2 billion scam involved the transfer of the OPL 245 purportedly from Malabu Oil and Gas Limited to Shell Nigeria Exploration Production Co. Limited and Nigeria Agip Exploration Limited

Diego Maradona has urged Boca Juniors to hire former Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino. The Argentine was sacked by Spurs last month and has since been linked with some of Europe’s biggest clubs. But Maradona, currently in charge of Gimnasia Y Esgrima La Plata, has tipped his compatriot to take over at Boca, who he describes as “the biggest team in the world”, following Gustavo Alfaro’s departure. “I will not go to Boca because I repeat that I do not agree with those who will manage the club,” Maradona told Ole. “The president [Jorge Amor Ameal] was already there and it was a disaster, he surrounded himself with [vice-president Mario Pergolini] who believes that he can handle the club. “And Roman… a club is not run within the locker room. It’s much harder than stopping the ball, giving a pass or kicking a free-kick. ✕ “Boca have to take a technician to play and feel what Boca is. It’s not easy to sit in that chair. The best of all is Maradona [laughs]. “But now I will not go, there at some point it happens. But I would like Mauricio Pochettino. You have to call him and convince him to come to lead the biggest team in the world.”

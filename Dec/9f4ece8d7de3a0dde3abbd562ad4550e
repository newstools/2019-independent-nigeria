LAGOS – The Association of Nigeria Licensed Customs Agents (ANLCA), the largest body of customs brokers and freight forwarders operating in Nigerian ports, at the weekend called on the Federal Government to decongest Lagos, Port Harcourt and Onne anchorages of vessels waiting to berth by diverting such to other ports. Iju Tony Nwabunnike, National President, ANLCA who made this call in Lagos, observe that a lot of ships are presently waiting to berth in Lagos, Port Harcourt and Onne, thereby attracting trucks and other heavy duty vehicles to these areas. According to him, this development has not only hampered free movement of cargo laden trucks, adding that it was also impacting adversely on the ongoing port access road construction.

Shippers and cargo owners according to him are very conscious about ships turnaround time and will likely embrace opportunities for quicker discharge of cargoes. “This diversion, in ANLCA’s opinion, will not only support the government’s Ease of Doing Business objective but will also reduce the number of trucks on some port access roads and allow speedy execution of the ongoing construction along the corridor. “It will also help in averting avoidable congestion with adverse effects in Lagos and Port Harcourt ports “This action requires some urgency before we enter another rainy season when construction work may be slowed down as it could lead to massive job losses if not approved and implemented. “It will also make for even distribution of maritime trade among cities where ports are domiciled while opening the economy to fresh business opportunities.”

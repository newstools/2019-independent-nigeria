The Inspector-General of Police (IGP) has written to Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) assuring him of adequate police protection at the planned APC rally scheduled to hold in Benin City tomorrow. In a letter from the IGP signed by his Principal Staff Officer, ACP Idowu Owohunwa dated 11th December and sighted by Daily Independent , the police boss said he is acknowledging Oshiomhole’s letter dated 10th December in which he requested for police protection for the rally. It will be recalled that the state governor, Godwin Obaseki had said as the Chief Security Officer of the state, he is not aware of any rally planned to hold in Benin City, on Friday, December 13. In a chat with journalists after the security meeting with head of security agencies in the state at Government House, in Benin City, the Edo State capital, the governor said, “I have checked with the state APC secretariat and as far as I am concerned, the party has not announced officially that they will be having a rally.” Pastor Osagie Ize- Iyamu, a former governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) who recently defected to the APC will be formally received into the APC at the rally alongside his supporters.

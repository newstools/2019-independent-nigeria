The Africa Network for Environment and Economic Justice (ANEEJ) has called on religious and traditional leaders in the South- East geographical zone to use their positions and institutions to advance anti-corruption issues in the region and beyond. Rev. David Ugolor, ANEEJ’s executive director, who was represented by Innocent Edemhanria, programme manager, at a town hall meeting in Enugu, said religious and traditional institutions had a big role to play in using behavioral change approach to tackle corruption because traditional and religious institutions were highly respected by their followers and subjects. “You have a wide reach and influence and millions of people listen to you, follow you, and obey your instructions and commands. “If your people, who see you as role models, identify with anti-corruption messages coming from you, and if they act upon them, I can assure you that corruption will be a thing of the past in Nigeria or, at least, will be reduced to a tolerable level,” Ugolor said.

ABEOKUTA – A former Governor of Ogun State and chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Aremo Olusegun Osoba, Monday, took a swipe at the Nigeria Senate over their social media and hate speech bills that are being considered by the senate. The veteran journalist who looked back at how the media fought for independence and the military, querried if the forefathers of the Senators fought for the liberation of the country from the colonial masters. He also queried if the senators propagating the bills were born during the battle against General Abacha to liberate the country from the shackles of the military. According to him, the controversial bills were targeted to muscle Nigerians most especially media practitioners adding that the media suffered to liberate Nigeria and entrench democracy in the country. Osoba said “We will be the victims of the bill if we allow it to sale through. “We fought the military to standstill. You recall many of our people lost their lives, those who are propagating a bill should remember, where were they when NADECO, the media stood up to fight Abacha? Were they born? Did their forefathers fight in those days when Hubert Macaulay and co, were fighting for liberation of the colonial system to independence and then we took it up under the military? “We all suffered under Abacha. The Guardian was burnt. Punch was closed down. Those who were running TELL Magazine had to run out of the country into exile. I can go on with the examples of deprivation we suffered. “We don’t deserve this treatment from senators who are now enjoying the benefit of the war that we waged against the military to entrench democracy in Nigeria. And I am happy that since 1999, democracy has come to stay.”

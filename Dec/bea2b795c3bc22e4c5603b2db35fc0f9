OWERRI â€“ Imo State governor, Emeka Ihedioha, has tasked the 2019 Batch C (Stream 11) Corps members deployed to the state to queue into his Rebuild Imo Project to contribute their quota towards the development and growth of the state, which he said, suffered retardation in the past eight years. This, he said, was consequent upon the poverty of vision and administrative by the immediate past administration in the state. Ihedioha gave the charge Monday when he officially declared open the orientation course for the corps members held at the NYSC Orientation Camp, Eziama Obara in the Nkwere Council Area during which the state Chief Judge, Justice Paschal Nnadi, administered the national pledge and the NYSC Oath of Allegiance on them through Justice Innocent Maduabuchi Njaka. The governor, who spoke through the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Youths and Social Development, Chibuzor Obinna, particularly charged the corps medical personnel among them to identify with and join the new NYSC Health Initiative for the Rural Dwellers (HIRD).

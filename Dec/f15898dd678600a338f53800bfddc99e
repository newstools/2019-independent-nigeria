Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State has cautioned the 2019 intending Christian pilgrims from the state, against absconding or engaging in commercial activities during the exercise in the holy land. Obaseki, who gave the caution at a one-day orientation/retreat held for the intending pilgrims on Thursday in Benin, also urged them to be good ambassadors of the state and Nigeria at large. The governor was represented by Ms. Itohan Bazuaye, Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Youths and Special Duties. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the orientation/retreat, organised by the state Christian Pilgrims Welfare Board, has as theme: ’Pilgrimage: A tool for Moral Transformation and Spiritual Rebirth’. The governor said the essence of the orientation was to physically and spiritually prepare the intending pilgrims for the journey to the holy land. He said the theme of the retreat was apt and timely, adding that the nation needed transformation and rebirth. “Our poor value system and attitude must change. If we must succeed, then, every Nigerian and particularly believers who have visited the Holy Land must take their rightful position as transformation builders,‘ ’he said. Also speaking, chairman, Edo Christian Pilgrims Welfare Board, Bishop Oyonnude Kure, said the retreat was aimed at correcting all wrong impressions concerning pilgrimage. “It is not for tourism and not for business. It is to fulfill God’s injunction, “Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee, whose heart is set on pilgrimage (Psalm 84:5), “he said. He thanked the state governor for providing the needed finances, logistics and medical team to ensure a successful 2019 pilgrimage. An intending pilgrim, Professor Jacob Unuigbe, said the retreat was a welcome idea, adding that it had exposed participants to the benefits of pilgrimage and ways to conduct themselves in the holy land.”

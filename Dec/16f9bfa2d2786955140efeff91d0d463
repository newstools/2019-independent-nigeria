Angola’s parliament approved a 2020 budget on Thursday which estimates the average oil price at $55 a barrel, the state news agency for Africa’s second-biggest oil exporter ANGOP reported. The projection is “a conservative strategy to protect the country if oil market volatility movements are unfavourable”, the agency cited the budget as saying, according to Reuters. Real GDP growth was predicted to be 1.8% and inflation 24%.

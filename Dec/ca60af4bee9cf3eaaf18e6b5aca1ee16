AKURE – Newly installed traditional ruler of Owo Kingdom in Ondo State, the Olowo of Owo, Oba Gbadegesin Ogunoye, on Saturday was presented the staff of office by Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu. Akeredolu, who emphasised that his administration would not interfere in any transparent process of selection of traditional rulers in the state, noted that the people’s tradition would not be undermined for political expediency. Appreciating the Omo- Olowos and the kingmakers for a rancour-free selection process, the governor said, “The spontaneous expression of joy, affectionate jubilation and fraternal camaraderie, which enveloped the whole kingdom, on the announcement of the choice by all the Omo- Olowo, compelled approval. “The new Olowo, a comely, calm, principled, honest and unassuming personality, has become the veritable tool employed by both terrestrial and celestial powers to unite our people. It has never been this good.” The governor, however, seized the occasion to reel out some of his programmes, assuring the people of the state of even distribution of social and economic dividends of good governance. He said: “I want to emphasise the fact that our administration is determined to ensure even distribution of social and economic benefits of good governance through the provision of infrastructural facilities and social amenities not only in urban cities but also in all communities in the state. “Some of the facilities being provided are road rehabilitation and construction across the state, renovation of public schools, rehabilitation of damaged boreholes, and massive provision of hospital equipment and consumables.” Among the traditional rulers that graced the occasion are Ooni of Ife, Oba OgunwusiEnitan, Deji of Akure Kingdom, Oba AladetoyinboAladelusiand Osemawe of Ondo Kingdom, Oba Victor Kiladejo.

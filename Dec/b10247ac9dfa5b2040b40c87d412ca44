Speaking at the 27th edition of its annual lecture and awards, in Lagos, Sunday Odita, President, Crime Reporters Association of Nigeria (CRAN) said: “We are elated as reporters to observe in the course of our duties that some people are doing things worthy of writing home about. When we noted that an Air Peace Crew demonstrated commendable professionalism and humanness by frustrating the attempt by two women to traffic a three-month old baby-boy on a Lagos-Banjul flight on June 4, 2018, we penned it down as something worthy of reward. The CRAN president commended his members “for unanimously voting to bestow the Most Security Conscious Crew Award on Air Peace Crew, when it was tabled before the house for voting.” This he added, shows that the honour is well deserved and well thought out. An elated, Stanley Olisa, Corporate Communications Executive, Air Peace, thanked the executives and national leadership of crime correspondents and noted that the airline trains its cabin crew to be security conscious.

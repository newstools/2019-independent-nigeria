During inauguration of the building, Akinfolarin said, “When you are given a mandate or responsibility by people, one of the ways to appreciate or reciprocate their gesture is to go back and say thank you. “There are so many things we have been doing but I don’t need cheap publicity or be making noise on social media. We have been doing our best to say thank you.” He disclosed that the project cost over N40 million, adding that there was need to create an enabling environment for students of the institution with a view to developing their potentials through support. Appreciating the Rector of the institution, Prof. Emmanuel Fasakin, the lawmaker said he was encouraged by the meteoric development on the campus due to the efforts of the Rector and his team.

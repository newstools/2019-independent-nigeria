The International Fund for Agricultural Develop­ment (IFAD) has built a market worth N13 million in Auyakayi village, Auyo Local Government Area of Jigawa State. Alhaji Umar Danzomo, IFAD’s Support Officer in the state, made the disclo­sure on Monday at the in­auguration of the grains and perishable items mar­ket. He said that the market, which had shops, stores, toilets and solar-powered boreholes, was built under the Climate Change Adap­tation Programme of the organisation. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Danzomo said that the programme would empow­er rural dwellers, increase their incomes and make them self-reliant. The officer hailed the federal, state and local gov­ernments for prompt pay­ment of their counterpart funds for IFAD projects, and called on benefitting com­munities to use the facili­ties judiciously.

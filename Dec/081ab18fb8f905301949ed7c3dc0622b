Katsina â€“ The Katsina State Government is set to enhance bilateral relationship on climate change with Norway.
Governor Aminu Bello Masari made this assertion during a visit to the Ambassador of Norway, Mr. Jens Petter Ksemprud, in Abuja.
Masari said he was at the embassy to discuss the need for Norway to help in converting climate change and check youths restiveness through social investment.
The governor explained that government was currently seeking ways to obtain minimal living standard for the citizenry through provision of basic vocational education and water supply among others.
Masari also enumerated the efforts being made by the APC administration to reduce to the barest minimum the cases of banditry and overcome farmers/herders clashes.
He expressed plans to work in close collaboration with the Norwegian Embassy to revitalise the livestock, diary production, leather tanning and other income generating activities for Fulani herdsmen in the state.
According to him, this would be done through the enhancement of water points, grazing areas and pastures in the forests.
He, however, assured that the provision of education, veterinary services and other welfare packages would be geared towards settling the Fulani herdsmen to stop their nomadic way of life.
Ambassador Jens Ksemprud, on his part, appreciated the visit, stressing that Norway would work with universities to rehabilitate tropical agriculture.
Petter revealed that research-based activities would be sponsored by the embassy, adding that his country has the mandate to assist in converting the effects of climate change.
He said Norway was also interested in the vocational training programmes in the state, stressing that it would look into the renewable energy sector with a view to improving it.

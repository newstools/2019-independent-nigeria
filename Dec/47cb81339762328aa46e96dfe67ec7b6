BAUCH – The Inclusive Forum for Accountability Society (IFAS) has called on the Nigerian government to intensify the fight against corruption, lamenting that the country has been ranked as the 144th out of 148 least corrupt nations in the world. Representative of IFAS, who is also the Executive Director of ‘Fahimta Women and Youth Development Initiative (FAWOYDI), Maryam Garba, made the revelation on Monday during the commemoration of the 2019 International Anti-Corruption Day organised by the non-governmental organisation, in collaboration with ActionAid Nigeria, held at Development Exchange Centre (DEC), Bauchi. She noted that the ranking was done by the Transparency International, adding that in view of the resources channelled through the states and local governments to serve the people, check and balance is imperative. She said IFAS had observed evidence of corruption in Bauchi State due to failed projects on which public funds have been spent, absence of infrastructure especially schools and primary health care facilities in rural areas, lack of safe drinking water in rural communities and lack of equipment, drugs and personnel in most rural health care facilities.

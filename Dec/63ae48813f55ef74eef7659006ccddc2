Prices of beans which had maintained a downward trend since late last year owing to increased supply have started increasing gradually since September but became more evident in some of the markets visited during the week. In spite of the fact that harvesting of new beans has not fully commenced, prices of the commodity appeared to be somewhat favourable especially when compared with what they were sold during the period of severe scarcity between 2017 and later part of 2018. The  security measures put in place by the by the Federal Government especially in North Eastern Nigeria to curb the menace of activities of the dreaded Boko Haram insurgents seemed to have really paved way especially for framers as they are now able to cultivate beans without fear of being molested or killed. The situation resulted to a significant increase in supply due to bumper harvest recorded, thus, leading to sharp reduction in the prices of the commodity, which appeared not to be affected adversely in its season of scarcity. The commodity is a staple food in Nigeria and usually recommended mostly for children by nutritionists because of the health benefits associated with the consumption of beans. Findings from a market survey across some states by the Business and Market Intelligence Unit of SUNDAY INDEPENDENT showed that prices of the commodity went up slightly by over 10 and 5 percent in few markets between September and December 5, 2019 Many of the traders, however, connected the situation to marginal cut in supply from its major suppliers coupled with logistics constraints. Visit to Markaifi Market, Kaduna, revealed that prices of a 100kg bag of brown beans (drum) witnessed a slight increase of over 5 percent, currently ranging from N21,500 to 22,000 up from N20,000 sold before. Likewise, the white variant, currently attracting N20,500 as against N19,000 initially sold, signifying a 8 percent rise. Mallam Yaqub Ishaq, who trades in the commodity at the Maikarfi Market, Kaduna, in a chat with our correspondent, blamed the situation to incessant rains which affected harvesting of new beans negatively. The same could be said of Gombe Main Market, Gombe State, especially with prices of a 100kg bag of brown beans currently going for between N21,500 and N22,000 up from N20,000 earlier sold. This, however, depends on the size of the bag, type of beans and haggling power of the customer. That of white beans however, rose slightly to N20,000 from N19,000 previously attracted. For that of Igbudu Market, the trend was not different as  prices of a 100kg bag of brown beans formerly sold for N21,000 increased  by 10 percent to between N23,000 and N23,700  while that of white beans went for N22,000 against N20,000 sold previously. Many of the traders at the Igbudu Market, Delta State, attributed the hike to shortfall in supply and high cost of logistics. That of Ose Market, Onitsha, also witnessed a marginal increase from what was sold before. For example, prices of a 100kg bag of brown beans which reduced further to N19,000 in September, rose again, currently selling for between N22,500 and N23,000 whereas that of white beans went for between N21,000 and N21,500 up from N20,000 initially sold. Mr. Francais Chuks, who trades in all kinds of grains at the Ose Market, Onitsha, linked the situation to seasonal factor, stressing that the increase was bearable as it did not have an adverse effect on his regular supplies. Visit to Lafenwa Market Ogun State, indicated that the price trend of beans was not at variance with that of other locations. For example, prices of a 100kg bag of beans that were earlier sold for between N23,000 and N23,500 grew to N25,000 while the white variant also grew to N23,500 from N21,000 sold previously. Most of the traders at the Lafenwa Market, Ogun State, attributed the cause to off-season effect but were optimistic it would certainly crash as the onset of season of harvest had begun. At the Bodija Market, Ibadan, prices of brown beans experienced a slight hike with a 100kg bag, currently ranging from N19,000 to N22,000 as against between N17,000 and N20,000 previously sold.  But this depends on the species, size of the bag and the bargaining power of the customer. That of white beans also rose slightly as prices of a 100kg bag currently go for between N20,000 and N21,000 as against N18,500 sold before. Many of the traders associated the situation to shortfall in supply from their main sources which remains the North. The same scenario played out in Lagos as visits to popular Mile 12 and Iddo markets revealed that prices of the commodity had gone up marginally coupled with the fact that the number of vendors had reduced drastically owing to the reduced patronage. Prices of a 100kg bag of beans grew sharply to between N18,000 and N23,000  during the week from between N15,000 and N20,000 previously sold. Madam Grace Obaji who retails the commodity at the Ojota Market ascribed the situation to season of scarcity. The increase also reflected to some extent in the prices of smaller measures. For example, prices of a paint bucket measurement previously sold for between N700 and N1000 soared, currently ranging from N800 to N1,200 depending on the specie and location.

LAGOS – The Lagos State government has through the Commissioner for Transportation, Dr Frederic Oladeinde, issued a strong warning to operators of events centres, private property owners and other places of attraction in the state that it is now compulsory for any event centre and private property owner preparing to host more than 50 guests to notify the General Manager, Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA) for adequate arrangement on management of traffic and parking of visitors’ vehicles. A ministry statement, a copy made available to DAILY INDEPENDENT by its Public Affairs Unit, stated that “The state government would no longer condone parking of vehicles on the road side by guests for failure of the operators/property owners to make provision for adequate parking space for their guests.” It said Oladeinde read who the riot act while commenting on the traffic gridlock experienced on Lekki – Express way on Saturday, linked the development to motorists who could not secure parking space in the venues of their social gathering and park their vehicles on the road sides. While apologising on behalf of the state government for the traffic gridlock experienced on the Lekki corridor at the weekend, the commissioner stated that it was regrettable that innocent citizens were forced to share in the pains caused by merry makers. While reminding that the relevant section of the State Traffic Laws that guide the operation of events centres in the state as regard parking of vehicles was still in place, Oladeinde warned that the state government would not hesitate to apply the law on any erring event centre or private property owner whose attendants block the road on account of inadequate parking space.

The Lagos State Chapter of the Independent Petroleum marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), Ejigbo Depot, yesterday sponsored over 200 petroleum Tanker Drivers on one-day safety awareness at its office in Ejigbo, Lagos.
The lecture at the seminar was delivered by Mr. Hyginus Omeje, the Lagos Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), represented by Olasehinde Egbontan, Route Commander.
In his welcome address, Akin Akinrinade, Chairman of IPMAN, appreciated the sterling contributions of the drivers in the downstream sector.
He stressed that the training was organised for them, not because the IPMAN doubted their competence, but because learning was a lifelong thing.
“Road traffic safety refers to the methods and measures used to prevent road users from being killed or seriously injured. In our peculiar case, it refers to methods and measures used to prevent both human and material loss.
“We deal in highly volatile products; somebody called them liquid fire. There is no product that our drivers transport on our behalf that is not highly inflammable,” he said.
Akinrinade charged the drivers to avoid drinking alcohol when driving or prepare to drive, advising further that they should avoid medications that alter their minds.
Egbotan dropped the hint that Federal Government, as from January 2020, would roll out some regulations to checkmate all the petroleum tanker drivers nationwide because of the carnage caused by reckless, impatient, dangerous and carefree drivers on the major roads.

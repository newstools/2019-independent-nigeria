Damaturu – Three people were feared killed on Sunday when suspected members of the Boko Haram attacked aid workers in Borno State. Sources also claimed that two others were kidnapped by the insurgents. The Boko Haram attack was said to have taken place along the Maiduguri-Monguno road. UN sources in Maiduguri, Borno State, confirmed the attack, but details were still sketchy as UN officials said it was too early to give details. However, it was gathered that the two abducted workers were female. “I can confirm to you that the sad incident happened today along Monguno road but one cannot be certain about the actual figure yet,” said the source who craved anonymity. It was gathered that the humanitarian workers were employees of an international NGO called Alima. Alima is the first NGO to set foot on the reclaimed town of Monguno in June 2016 when it commenced humanitarian aid operations in Borno State. It is still providing services in Monguno to date. All efforts to contact officials of Alima for further confirmation were not successful at the time of this report. The military too could not be reached for confirmation and had not released any statement on the attack. It was also reported that residents of Damaturu, the Yobe State capital, were thrown into pandemonium on Sunday evening when they heard strange sounds of gunshots and explosions in the town. A resident of Zanna Zakariyya Housing Estate, Damaturu, Abdullahi Musa told Daily Independent that “this evening, around 5:30p.m, we started hearing sounds of gunshots and saw people running and rushing home; later we saw a helicopter and jet fighter hovering over the entire town”. But efforts to contact the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), ASP Abdulmalik Abdulhafeez, to find out the cause of the pandemonium proved abortive up to the time of filing this report.

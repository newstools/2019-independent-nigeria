A church in Nairobi has warned its members against wearing ‘inappropriate’ attire to church. St Peter Claver’s Catholic Church, which is located in the city centre, has put a huge sign at the entrance of the church, warning congregants to dress modestly. Some of the attire banned include dresses with slits, rugged jeans, miniskirts, t-shirts inscribed ‘Red Devil’, crop tops, caps, sun glasses, chains, clothing that exposes arms and sagged trousers. It is not clear what would happen to congregants who break the rules as efforts by the Nation to get comments from administrators of the church were unsuccessful.

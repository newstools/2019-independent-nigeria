The police on Friday arraigned one unemployed Lekan Falogba before an Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court over alleged possession of a gun and membership of an unlawful society.
Falogba, 28, is facing a three-count charge of conspiracy, membership of an unlawful society and illegal possession of firearms.
The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge.
According to the Prosecutor, ASP Peter Nwangwu, Falogba unlawfully had in his possession, a locally-made single-barrel shortgun and five unexpended cartridges.
Nwangwu told the court that the defendant committed the offences with others still at large, on Nov. 7 at 8.00p.m. at Pump and Sell Roundabout, Langbasa, Ado, Eti- Osa, Lagos.
The prosecutor alleged that the defendant also belonged to a cult, known as Eiye confraternity.
“The police arrested the defendant after they received a distress call from on his hideout, while the other accomplices escaped,” Nwangwu said.
He said that the offences contravened Sections 42, 330 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015.
The Chief Magistrate, Mrs Yewande Aje- Afunwa, granted the defendant bail in the sum of N500, 000 with two sureties in like sum.
She ordered that the sureties must be gainfully employed and have evidence of two years’ tax payment to the Lagos State Government.
The magistrate adjourned the case until Jan. 8, 2020.

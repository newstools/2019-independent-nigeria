WARRI – The Niger Delta Accountability Network (NDAN) has commended the decision of the Senate to demand the inauguration of the board of Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) before the consideration of the commission’s 2019/2020 budgets. In a press statement signed by its President, Patrick Funkekeme and General Secretary, Richard Irabor, the group described the Senate’s decision as a “bold move for the re-establishment of order and due process.” It added that the decision of the Senate has reinforced its faith in the capacity of the 9th National Assembly to provide credible oversight while cooperating with the executive branch, and asked President Muhammadu Buhari to “reciprocate the Senate’s goodwill by directing the newly confirmed board to resume immediately.” The NDAN said the Senate, by insisting on the board’s inauguration, has proven to be a “dependable ally of the people” It added, “The Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria has shown that it is a law-abiding institution and credible ally of the people with its decision to follow the law on the defence of the NDDC budget. “We are encouraged that Mr President as a firm believer in law and due process will not allow the illegal interim management committee continue to distort the operations of the NDDC.” It would be recalled that at plenary on Tuesday, after the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan had read out a letter from the President presenting the NDDC 2019/2020 budget for consideration, Senate Minority Leader, Enyinnaya Abaribe drew the attention of members to the fact that the board, which was confirmed on November 5, had not been inaugurated; rather, the NDDC was still being run by an interim committee, which was hastily put together by the minister of Niger Delta Affairs. He made it clear that the NDDC Act does not provide for an interim management and it would be unlawful for people not known to the law to defend its budget proposals. Lawan agreed with Abaribe and asked that the newly confirmed board defend the budget before the NDDC Committee.

LAGOS – The Motormech and Technicians’ Association of Nigeria (MOMTAN), Lagos chapter, has condemned Nigerians who import substandard vehicle spare parts and lubricants into the country. Speaking at the association’s annual seminar in Ikeja, Lagos, Alhaji Marufu Arowolo, its chairman, said that the use of fake vehicle spare parts and substandard lubricants had led to many accidents that had sent many to their early graves, while many were maimed for life. He argued that the importers of the fake and substandard products placed pecuniary gains above human life, while calling on them to stop the practice forthwith. He accused some foreign companies of manufacturing fake spare parts and substandard lubricants and conniving with some unscrupulous Nigerians to import such products into the country. Arowolo said his association was poised to wage war on the importers of fake spare parts and substandard lubricants and called on the National Assembly, the judiciary, law enforcement agencies, Standard Organisation of Nigeria (SON), Council of Registered Engineers of Nigeria(COREN) and others to join the association in the fight to end the importation of fake spare parts and substandard lubricants into the country.

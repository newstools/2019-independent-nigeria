Two men, Saheed Afolabi, 21 and Moshood Tolani, 18, on Friday appeared before an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court in Lagos, for allegedly stealing goods valued at N800,000.
The defendants, who have no fixed address, were charged with conspiracy and stealing.
The Prosecutor, Insp. Mojirade Edeme, told the court that the defendants and others still at large committed the offences on Dec. 3, at Alagbado, Lagos.
She said that the defendants stole goods belonging to Mrs Bolanle Yusuf and Messrs Anayo Onuoja, Chukwuma Obidile and Nwuzor Chukwuka.
“The defendants invaded the complainants’ shops with dangerous weapons and carted away their goods.
“They stole gas cylinders, electric cookers, clothes, phones and one LG television set, among other items.
“One of the complainants quickly alerted the police who stormed the scene.
“The defendants were arrested while the others escaped with the looted goods,” the prosecutor said.
The alleged offences contravene Sections 287 and 411 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State, 2015.
Section 287 prescribes three years’ jail term for stealing, while Section 411 provides for two years’ imprisonment for conspiracy.
Following their not guilty pleas, Magistrate O.A. Aderibigbe granted each of them N150,000 bail with two sureties each in like sum.
Aderibigbe said that the sureties should be gainfully employed and show evidence of two years’ tax payment to the Lagos State Government.
The magistrate adjourned the case until Jan. 16, or further hearing.

LAGOS – The Nigeria Christian Gradu­ate Fellowship has expressed dissatisfaction with President Muhammadu Buhari over his alleged comment on the recent execution of 11 Chris­tians, saying the political class is only being hypocritical over the continued killings by the Boko Haram insurgents. The group in a statement jointly signed by its National President and General Secre­tary, Prof. Charles Adisa and Mr. Onyenachi Nwaegeruo, said the hypocrisy of the po­litical class constitutes more threat to the unity of Nigeria than the Boko Haram sect. “The Nigeria Christian Graduate Fellowship read with mixed feelings, Presi­dent Muhammadu Buhari’s statement on the Christmas Day horrendous execution of 11 Christians by The Islamic State in West Af­rica Province (ISWAP) in Borno State, in which he condemned the execution of innocent Christians hos­tages by the Boko Haram insurgents. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network “Our mixed feelings stem from the fact that on the one hand, the President as the fa­ther of the nation is appalled by the murderous act.” “On the other hand, however, we are not excited about Mr. President’s ser­mon on why religious intol­erance as being exhibited by Boko Haram should not be allowed to divide us as a na­tion. The President has not before now, either in word or in deed, demonstrated that religion should not be a factor in national unity,” the statement reads. Adding, “Indeed, we make bold to say that the president has not only benefited from disunity orchestrated by reli­gion, he has himself over the years been an advocate of re­ligious intolerance.”

ASABA – Determinef to sustain peace and harmony, organised youth groups and youth activities in the troubled town of Uzere in Isoko South Local Government Area of Delta State have been suspended indefinitely. The suspension of youths activities might not be unconnected with a renewed hostility in the oil-rich community. Isoko South Local Government Security Council, arising from an Emergency Security meeting, suspended with immediate effect all organised community youth groups and activities in Uzere community indefinitely. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Secretary to the Local Government Council, Prince Dennis Obrogo, said in a statement that the council resolved to take appropriate action against non-adherence to this directive. “This is sequel to the intensification of hostilities among the various sections of the youths of the community and the attendant carnage, brigandage and arson. Recall that Uzere had come under fire recently as unknown gunmen invaded the community, inflicting injuries on many indigenes shortly after a disagreement over which faction had authority to issue marriage certificate to a newly married couple from the community. The invasion added a new twist to the supremacy tussle rocking the community after two monarchs laid claim to the Ovie throne. In the renewed oil crisis, several houses were torched by suspected militia youths groups in the community.

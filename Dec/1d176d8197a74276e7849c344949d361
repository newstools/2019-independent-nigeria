BENIN – The Edo State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), on Wednesday, condemned what it described as “the grandstanding of the various factions of the APC in regards to the factional rally scheduled for Friday, December 13, 2019. ” The party regretted that Edo State which hitherto was a peaceful and tolerant state was now being threatened to be turned to Kabul, the capital of war-torn Af
ghanistan! According to a statement signed by the state Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Chris Osa Nehikhare, in the last 24 to 48 hours, Edo people have been inundated with threats and counter threats from at least three factions that exists in a party that is known for its intolerance and propensity for violence, maiming, and arson. “Their intolerance has led to the non-representation of up to 14 constituencies in the state house of assembly since its proclamation. “The attacks and maiming on their own members in Owan, Estako Central and Ovia North-East local government areas in Edo State is a mind boggling issue that needs to be pondered on by well-meaning Edo people. “They are now upping the ante by boasting and accusing each other of importing thugs from Kogi State. We are all aware of the antecedents of Kogi APC thugs. “We, hereby, call on the police and other security agencies to be at alert as the buildup tensions by the disgruntled factions in Edo APC can only deliver sorrow, tears and blood. “We advise that a proper and effective security arrangement be put in place to checkmate these “tatatata political” misfits. “Edo PDP sympathise with Edo people who are now made to feel insecure and bear the brunt of the naked and crude power play within a party that was foist off on them. “There is, however, light at the end of the tunnel. Edo people will have a chance to vote and chase these crazy bald heads out of the town in a few months.”

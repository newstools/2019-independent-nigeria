Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has missed out on Erling Haaland, with the Red Bull Salzburg star sealing a transfer to Borussia Dortmund instead. Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has reportedly identified Lyon’s Moussa Dembele as a transfer alternative to Erling Haaland. Haaland has chosen to snub a move to Old Trafford in favour of moving to Bundesliga giants Borussia Dortmund. Manchester United boss Solskjaer had been hoping to secure a reunion with Haaland, who he previously managed at Molde in Norway. However, on Sunday, the Red Bull Salzburg star announced that he’d be moving to Bundesliga titans Borussia Dortmund instead. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Haaland explained his choice by saying: “I had intensive discussions with the club management and the sports management, especially with Hans-Joachim Watzke, Michael Zorc and trainer Lucien Favre. “There was a feeling right from the start that I absolutely wanted to switch to this club, go this route and play football in this incredible Dortmund atmosphere in front of more than 80,000 spectators. “I’m already burning for it.” And the Daily Mail say that United have now identified Dembele as an alternative. The Red Devils were linked with the Lyon star when the transfer window was open in the summer. On that occasion, United were looking for a replacement for Romelu Lukaku, who joined Inter Milan. But they stopped short of following up their interest in the France international. However, with Haaland now set for Dortmund, United are seemingly keen to bring him in.

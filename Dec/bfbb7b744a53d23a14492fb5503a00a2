LAGOS – Friday Ekpo, former Super Eagles midfielder, has harped on the need for players in the Nigerian senior national team to blend and bond in order to stand better chances of winning their matches, as he reckoned that they needed more understanding among one another. In a radio sports programme monitored in Lagos, the diminutive former midfieldrer acknowledged that the young players of the present squad should not be put under undue pressure by stakeholders in the country’s football, he stressed that the Super Eagles would play better once they study one another. “I strongly believe that players in the Super Eagles can get to play better as a team once they learn to study themselves at their various clubs. “They should not wait until they get to the national team’s camp before they start talking about blending. “They need to watch the matches of their colleagues. That way, they will be under less pressure to blend in camp,” he said. He reckoned further that it was not enough for the players to bond during camping or try to know one another during training, as it would be better, easier and more effective if they actually do the process of understanding how they play individually by watching videos of their various club matches, which he says would accord the lads comfortable ways of knowing their various gifts. The Senegal ’92 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) bronze medalist, who was among the first set of Nigerian players to ply their trade in Gabon, with FC 105, back in the early 90s, added that studying various matches of their respective clubs would provide a calm manner of getting to know one another from a distance, without any pressure of time or battle for shirts distracting them in camp.

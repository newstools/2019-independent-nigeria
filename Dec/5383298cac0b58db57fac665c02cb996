AWKA â€“ The Federal High Court sitting in Enugu has ordered the committal of Ifediba Samson Umejidike to the Enugu Prison for diverting German company product STIHL Court exhibits. Umejidike had allegedly registered the famous STIHL trade mark belonging to Andreas Stihl AG & Co. KG, a world-renowned German company known for manufacturing the STIHL range of power products, which include chainsaws and other handheld power equipment. Umejidike was also alleged to have acted as a trade mark troll and unlawfully registered a company in Nigeria using the company name of Andreas Stihl AG & Co. KG. With these registration documents, Umejidike was said to have obtained an Anton Pillar Order, which was executed in Lagos at the premises of the C. Woermann Nigeria Limited, the Nigerian sole distributors of STIHL range of products in Nigeria. After the execution, Umejidike hijacked STIHL products worth several million of naira which were meant to be taken to the court in Enugu State and diverted the products to his house at Anambra State. He refused to return the products even when the court bailiffs came to his house in Anambra State to recover the STIHL products. Ruling on the contempt proceedings initiated by Andreas Stihl AG & Co. KG and C. Woermann Nigeria Limited on the diverted STIHL products, the presiding Judge at the weekend, Justice R.O. Dugbo-Oghoghorie noted that it was an affront to the court that Umejidike having misled the Court to obtain an ex parte Order now stopped coming to court and started using different counsel to try and shield himself from the long arm of the law.

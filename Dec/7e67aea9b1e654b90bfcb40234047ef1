Zlatan Ibrahimovic was out to tease fans again and rile up more free marketing in an interview with GQ Magazine. The former Sweden striker has left LA Galaxy after his contract elapsed having scored an impressive 52 goals in 56 games and has been messing with the football world online ever since over his next destination.  Probably another marketing tactic, but Zlatan is really making it seem like it’ll be AC Milan 187 His latest plot twist states, “I will go to a team that needs to start winning agains, that needs to renew it’s history. I’ll see you soon in Italy.” This message obviously excited lots of AC Milan fans but could just be another marketing ploy by Ibrahimovic and Mino Raiola to gain more exposure in the media or to influence negotiations. The vague statement could point to other clubs in Italy such as Inter Milan, Fiorentina or even Bologna. There were reports of an agreement from The Telegraph a few days ago which we reported here. Let’s see where the journeyman ends up in the January transfer window.

LAGOS – The United Kingdom has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Ogun State Government to enhance urban planning, improve the transportation system and provide technical assistance to develop strategies that will address the impact of climate change and ensure development is sustainable. The programme is part of the Global Future Cities Programme, which supports a range of strategic interventions in 19 cities across 10 countries including Abeokuta and Nairobi. The overall objective is to deliver the programme in two phases; the strategic development phase and the implementation phase. During the strategic development phase, a planning channel will take place in each city and will involve high-level decision makers from the public and private sector together with representatives of society. In addition, a targeted and customised training programme for senior officials from the 19 cities will take place. This training will be positioned for success as a result of increased capacity in the host country at city and institutional level. Each of the 19 cities will be visited before the commencement of the training workshop, which will be held in London. Guy Harrison, the Head of Prosperity, British Deputy High Commission Lagos, who leads the UK team to the signing ceremony, which held at the State Governor’s office in Abeokuta said: “In 2015, the UK government created a new cross-government Prosperity Fund to help promote economic growth in developing countries. Its broad priorities include improving the business climate, competitiveness and operation of markets, energy and financial sector reform, and increasing the ability of governments to tackle corruption.

AKURE â€“ Alumni Association of Aquinas College, Akure, on Friday awarded scholarships to 12 Senior Secondary School (SS2) students of the school. Announcing the scholarship at the assembly ground, the President of the set, Dr. Akinsorotan Ademola, revealed the scholarships were financed by 1983/1989 set of the school. He explained that the scholarships would cover the registration of the students for West African School Certificate Examination and Joint Admissions Matriculation Examination. Dr. Akinsorotan revealed that the 1989 Senior Prefect, Denis Adekunle, has also promised to give each beneficiary of the scholarship N5,000. According to the president of the set, all members of the set would at different levels impact in the lives of the awardees varying from purchase of books to uniforms for them (students). Explaining how the beneficiaries were chosen for the scholarship, Dr. Akinsorotan said the academic performance of the students was the major criterion for the award. He, however, charged all the students who benefited from the award not to relent in their performances, warning that for them to enjoy the scholarships, they must have at least five distinctions in their promotion examination to SS3. The scholarships, according to Dr. Akinsorotan, became necessary to encourage the students in their academics particularly in face of rising social vices among youths in the country.

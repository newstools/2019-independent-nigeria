KANO – Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, Governor of Kano State, has given Emir Muhammad Sanusi II a two-day ultimatum to accept or reject his appointment as the chairman, Kano State Council of Chiefs. Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje had on December 9th appointed the embattled emir of Kano, Malam Muhammad Sanusi II as chairman of the rotational Council of Chiefs, and ordered him to convey inaugural meeting immediately. The appointment of Sanusi II as Chairman, Council of Chief by Ganduje appeared to have boxed the embattled emir to a corner where by provision and circumstances of the new law compels him to recognise his ex-title chiefs as men of equal rank and status. The ultimatum was contained in a leaked memo dated December 19th, and signed by Musa Yahaya Bichi, Permanent Secretary Special Duties on behalf of the Secretary to the State Government. Part of the letter reads, “His Excellency the Executive Governor is requesting His Highness the Emir of Kano to indicate his acceptance or otherwise of his appointment as the chairman of Kano State Council of Chiefs as conveyed vide letter No SSG/ REPA/S/A/86/T and dated 9th December 2019.” The letter directed that “the acceptance or otherwise should reach his excellency the executive governor of Kano State within two days of the receipt of this letter”. Just yesterday, Ganduje announced receipt of a letter from coalition of 35 CSOs asking him to dethrone the 19th Fulani Emir of Kano for failing to submit himself to constituted authority. Ganduje had earlier in the week pledged to implement all provisions of emirates Law 2019 by 100 percent.

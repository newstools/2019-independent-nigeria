Lagos-based political activist, Chief Adesunbo Onitiri has called on President Muhammmadu Buhari to, as father of the nation, cancel the November 16 Kogi and Balyesa governorship elections because of electoral violence that characterized the polls. While ordering for fresh elections, the political activist who made the call in Lagos yesterday in a press statement said the president should declare a state of emergency and appoint administrators for the two states. He declared “All Democrats and patriotic Nigerians wish to call on President Buhari to cancel the recently conducted Governorship and senatorial elections in Kogi and Balyesa states. The elections fell short of all democratic norms. It was not fair credible not free, in view of callous murder of a political women leader who was set ablaze in her house by suspected political thugs. “In fact it was the worst election ever conducted in Nigeria. The last exercise was a free demonstration of craziness and lunacy. It was a total war condoned by government security agencies and compromised INEC officials. The election has turned Nigeria to a laughing stock in the comity of developed nations. So many innocent citizens were openly brutalized, maimed and killed. No election in Nigeria was worth the blood of any citizen.”

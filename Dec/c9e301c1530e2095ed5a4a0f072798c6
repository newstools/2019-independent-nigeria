Prices of frozen foods and other staples such as rice have continued to skyrocket following the closure of Nigeria’s land borders by the Federal Government. Some traders could no longer continue with the business owing to the huge amount involved in buying their normal supplies and the risk involved in smuggling the commodity into the Nigerian market. The insistence of the Federal Government that Nigerians should patronise their locally produced items is a good one, but not being self-sufficient in the production of agricultural products to meet the market demand makes it an exercise in futility. This is because despite the tightening of security measures put in place around surrounding land borders, frozen foods such as chicken and turkey are still being smuggled into the Nigerian market at an expensive cost which eventually is borne by the consumers. There is no doubt that the continued closure of the borders by the Federal Government has inflicted untold hardship on consumers especially with the persistent hike in the prices of locally produced food items by traders. Prior to the ban of frozen foods and other staples, the locally produced food items were cheap, but the situation appeared not be to so again as traders have to capitalise on the opportunity to make brisk profit, inflating the prices of food items outrageously owing to increased demand, arising from scarcity. Findings from a market survey across some states by the Business and Market Intelligence Unit of SUNDAY INDEPENDENT revealed that prices of frozen foods soared by over 30 and 20  per cent  in few markets between August and November 28, 2019. Reasons predominantly mentioned for the persistent rise in prices of frozen foods were closure of borders and scarcity. During the week, checks at the Wuse Market, Abuja, showed that prices of frozen foods were still at an upward trend of which many of the traders connected to sharp shortfall in supply. For example, a carton of frozen chicken earlier sold for between N11,500 and N12,000  currently go for  between N15,000 and N15,500, representing a 31 per cent rise. Likewise, that of frozen turkey previously sold for N14,000 soared by 25 per cent,  currently attracting between N17,500 and N18,000 depending on the size and the haggling power of the customer. Prices of a kilo of frozen chicken at the Wuse Market, Abuja, currently sell for N1,500 while that of turkey sells within the region of  N1,750 and N1,800. At the Achau Market, Kaduna, the situation was not different, particularly with the prices of a carton of frozen chicken going for N14,500 up from 11,000 formerly sold while that of turkey initially sold for N13,000 rose to N17,000. Prices of the smaller measure popularly referred to as ‘kilo’ were also affected as that of chicken went for N1,400 against N1,000 previously while that of turkey increased to N1,700 from N1,300 sold before. Mr. Lawrence Ogbonna, who trades in the commodity at the Achau Market, Kaduna, attributed the situation to insufficient supply. The same could said of Ogbeogologo Market, Asaba, Delta State, particularly with the prices of a carton of  frozen chicken currently ranging from N15,000 to N16,000 as against N12,500 previously sold while that of frozen turkey initially sold for N14,000 grew to N18,000 in the week under review. Prices of a kilo of chicken increased to N1,500 from N1,200  earlier sold while that of turkey attracted  N1,800  against  N1,400 initially sold. For Ose Market, Onitsha, a carton of frozen chicken soared, currently ranging from N14,500  and N15,000 up from N12,000 formerly sold. That of frozen turkey also soared, selling within the region of N17,000 and N17,500 of which many  of the traders linked to severe scarcity and logistics constraints. In Lafenwa Market, Ogun State, prices of the commodity were still on the high side despite the proximity to the border. For instance, a carton of frozen chicken that was earlier sold for N10,000 rose to between N13,000 and N13,300 while that of turkey goes for N16,000 up from N12,000 previously sold. Prices of a kilo of frozen chicken and turkey currently sells within the region of N1,300 and N1,600  respectively as against  between N1,000 and N1,300 previously. At the Bodija Market, Ibadan, the trend was similar but there was evidence of scarcity as most frozen foods shops were shut due to lack of money to continue the business. The few ones that had the commodity complained of fear not getting their normal supplies when they run out of stock due to increased demand. Prices of the commodity remained high since the closure of borders. For example, a carton of frozen turkey sold for between N12,000 and N13,000 increased to N17,000 while that of chicken went for between N13,500 and N14,000  up from N11,000 previously sold. A kilo of turkey currently go for N1,700 while that of chicken attracted N1,400 as against N1,100 sold before. Mrs. Emily Aigbogun, a frozen food dealer at the Bodija Market, Ibadan, blamed the hike on the insensitivity of the government towards the welfare of the masses. In Lagos, visits to popular markets such as Mile 12, IJora and Ogba indicated that prices of the commodity (Local and imported) kept skyrocketing. For example, prices of a kilo of chicken initially sold for between N1,100 and N1,200 increased to N1,400 while that of turkey currently range from N1,700to N1,800 as against N1,400 previously sold. A carton of frozen turkey and chicken went up to N14,000 and N18,000 respectively as against  N12,000  and N14,000 initially sold. Many of the traders at the Ogba Market, Lagos, connected the situation to scarcity arising from the closure of borders as well as the inability of local producers to meet the market demand.

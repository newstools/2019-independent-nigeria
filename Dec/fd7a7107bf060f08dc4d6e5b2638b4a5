Jalingo – Taraba State Governor, Darius Ishaku, has assured National Youth Service Corp (NYSC) members in the state that the “government of Taraba State is leaving no stone unturned as far as security issues are concerned” and urged them to go about their “lawful duties without fear of intimidation or molestation”.
This assurance was given during the closing ceremony of the 2019 Batch C, Stream 2 Orientation Course at the NYSC Orientation Camp in Sibre Ardo Kola LGA, on Wednesday.
In her speech, the Taraba State NYSC Coordinator, Sarah Yaakugh, urged the corp members to be agents of positive change in the communities they will be posted to.
“Explore the resources in those areas and harness them for economic development of the state. Never allow the heavy investment in your skills acquisition training to waste, as it was designed to make you self-reliant other than job seekers,” she added.
According to the state NYSC coordinator, 1,100 were deployed to Taraba but only 941 showed up, which could have been as a result of the negative reports the corps members heard on Taraba.

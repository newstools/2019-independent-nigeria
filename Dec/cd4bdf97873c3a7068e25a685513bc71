IBADAN – A pan-Yoruba sociopolitical group, Yoruba Youth Forum has warned the All Progressives Congress (APC) against causing instability in Oyo State following the controversial Appeal Court ruling on Oyo state gubernatorial election. The group in a press statement by its President General, Abiodun Bolarinwa said the controversial ruling of the Appeal Court as it relates to Oyo State is tantamount to introducing instability in the Pacesetter State. “The controversial ruling of Appeal Court on gubernatorial election in Oyo state is an attempt by the ruling party, APC to tamper with the mandate of Oyo people. The good people of Oyo state will prevent any attempt by any individual or group to tamper with the mandate of the people,” the statement read in part. The group described the election that brought in Seyi Makinde as the wish of Oyo state people and that no amount of controversial ruling will hijack the wish of the people. “The election that brought in Engr. Seyi Makinde represents the wishes of the people. We believe that the Supreme Court, to which both PDP and APC have now headed to, would resolve the matter in the interest of justice, fairness and upholding the unbiased integrity of the judiciary. Governor Seyi Makinde will no doubt triumph in Supreme Court.” Speaking further, Bolarinwa condemned the Social Media Bill and the Hate Speech Bill being currently pushed forward, saying that such attempts by APC government to tamper with the fundamental human rights of Nigerians would always fail. He also commended former President Olusegun Obasanjo for always putting Nigeria first in everything. “The recent utterance of former President Olusegun Obasanjo in Adis Ababa about Nigeria is an indication that the ex-president has the interest of Nigeria at heart,” he added.

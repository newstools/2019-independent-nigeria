ILORIN – A professor of law at the University of London, Mashood Baderin, has said that realisation of the desire to see Nigeria mentioned among the comity of developed nations required a complete attitudinal change by people of the country, both the leaders and the led. Baderin, a Nigerian, made the submission in the convocation lecture entitled “Nigeria In Search of Peace, Security And Socio-Economic Survival: The Islamic Option” which he delivered during the convocation ceremony of the Al-Hikmah University in Ilorin. The don said though contemporary Western political theory argues that building strong institution is the most important pillar for good governance, he said Nigeria with these institutions had not yet lived up to expectation of good governance. He said this was because a morally upright leadership and populace, which he said Islam described as the most important pillar, were not prevailing.

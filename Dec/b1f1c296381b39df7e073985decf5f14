ENUGU – The National Population Commission (NPC) has launched the 2018 National Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) report in Enugu State. Making welcome remarks at the event witnessed by key stakeholders, Hon. Ejike Eze, the Federal Commissioner, NPC, Enugu State, said the survey was the sixth conducted in Nigeria since 1990. According to Eze, the survey provides up-to-date estimates on basic demographic and health indicators in the entire country. “Towards accomplishing this survey report, the National Population Commission worked in close collaboration with the National Malaria Elimination Programme (NMEP) under the Federal Ministry of Health across the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). “A total of 41, 821 women, ages 15-49 in 40, 427 households and 13,311 men, ages 15-59 in one third of the sampled households were interviewed, representing a response rate of 99 percent of women and 99 percent of men,” Eze said. He said new innovative approaches were used in the conduct of the 2018 NDHS, first among them, the improvement of anthropometry processes to collect high quality height and weight measurements from children and women and introduction of a new biomarker checklist to ensure no important tasks were missed.

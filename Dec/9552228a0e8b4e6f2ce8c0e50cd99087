Everton look to rebound from midweek defeat to Liverpool with Chelsea the visitors to Goodison Park this weekend. That Merseyside Derby defeat was Marco Silva‘s last game in charge, and interim boss Duncan Ferguson is without defender Yerry Mina, who picked up a knock in that game. Chelsea got back to winning ways against Aston Villa in midweek, with the return of Tammy Abraham for that game a welcome boost for Frank Lampard. Antonio Rudiger is not far away from a first team return, but Andreas Christensen and Kurt Zouma continue as the centre-back partnership.  Team news is in! Thoughts? #EVECHE pic.twitter.com/Yoqjr9PWuX — Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) December 7, 2019   Everton XI: Pickford; Sidibe, Holgate, Keane, Digne; Schneidelin, Sigurdsson; Walcott, Iwobi, Richarlison; Calvert-Lewin.

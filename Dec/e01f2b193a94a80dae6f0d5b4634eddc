About seven million people across Zimbabwe are at risk of going hungry as a result of successive droughts and rising inflation. According to the Famine Early Warning Systems Network, Zimbabwe is at a “Phase 3” food crisis, meaning that acute malnutrition is widespread. “Families have run out of options to put food on their tables,” said Dorrett Byrd, Catholic Relief Services’ (CRS) regional director for Southern Africa. “There have been extensive crop failures and we’re seeing families who have depleted their food supplies. At the same time, families’ savings have been wiped out because of inflation.” Over the last five years, Zimbabwe has been plagued by recurrent droughts and dry spells. In a country where more than half the population survives on small-scale farming, that means that families have been forced to cope by using their savings or selling off household assets to buy food. According to figures from the United Nations office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), approximately 7 million people in Zimbabwe are in urgent need of food assistance.

To make matters even worse, families are contending with severe inflation, making their economic situation even more precarious. In addition to a variety of multi-sectoral assistance programs, CRS is training Zimbabwean farmers to use climate-smart farming techniques, such as improved soil and water conservation. CRS is also providing farmers with drought-resistant crops and livestock. In addition, CRS is working with the government to send text messages to farmers to warn them about potential risks to their crops. The humanitarian situation in Zimbabwe is expected to further deteriorate in the months ahead, with projections for poor rainfall and harvests continuing into 2020.

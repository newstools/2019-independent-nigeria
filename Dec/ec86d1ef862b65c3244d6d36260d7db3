A Jos Upper Area Court sitting in Kasuwan  Nama, on Tuesday, sentenced a 27-year-old applicant, Aaron Peter, to one- year imprisonment for stealing canopy iron stands. The Presiding Judge, Mr. Yahaya Mohammed, handed down the sentence after the convict had pleaded guilty to the one-count charge of theft and begged the court for leniency. Mohammed, who did not give the accused an option of fine, said it would serve as a deterrent to those who might be nursing the ambition of committing such a nefarious act. Earlier, the Police Prosecutor, Sgt. Ibrahim Gokwat had told the court that the case was reported on Oct. 14 at the Anglo-Jos divisional police headquarters by one Musa Dankwon, who resides at Hwolshe. He said that the case was later transferred to the police Criminal Investigations Department, Jos for discreet investigation and prosecution. Gokwat further explained that the defendant, who resides opposite Excellence School, Sabon-Garin Tudun Wada, Jos, stole the canopy irons from the house of one Ngo Bachanji, a resident of Hwolshe. He said that during police investigation, the accused voluntarily confessed to have committed the crime. According to him, the offense contravenes Section 272 of the Plateau State Penal Code, Law of Northern Nigeria.

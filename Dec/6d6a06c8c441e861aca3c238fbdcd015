OWERRI – Commissioner of Police Imo State Rabiu Ladodo has charged members of the state chapter of the Police Community Relations Committee (PCRC) to continue to build bridges between the police and members of the public for the reduction of crime in the society.
Ladodo noted that his 3-point agenda of fighting crime, community policing and justice has continued to receive impetus with the support and cooperation of the committee particularly in the reduction of the illegal use of arms.
The police Chief stated this at a brief but colourful ceremony marking the end of the year party/investiture of the organisation held at the Police Officers mess in Owerri.
“You can’t fight crime without justice and you cannot establish effective community policing without justice otherwise members of the public will not take you seriously,” he said.
Ladodo disclosed that the PCRC has since been established in all police divisions in the state to strengthen the onslaught against criminality, adding that PCRC is now nationally recognised with strong presence in all the 36 states of the federation.
Ogbuehi Valentine Amafili (Chinyereugo), state chairman of the organisation listed school campaign against criminality and cultism, Radio Phone-in programme which he said enables the public to air their views, make recommendations and show their disgust at their relationship with the police and their activities as well as elections, new divisions as among the achievements of his administration.
Amafili however pleaded with the DPOs and Area Commanders to assist in re-establishing as well as reinvigorating the dormant PCRCs within their supervision, stressing that their interactions with the body in their areas could not be over emphasised.

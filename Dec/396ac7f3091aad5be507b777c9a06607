The Governor made this known while declaring open a seminar on road safety during the festive season tagged; ‘Safer Roads, Safer Season in Ogun State’, which was organised by the state Interim Committee on Transportation in conjunction with Tunes Communications Limited in held Abeokuta. Abiodun, who was represented by Noimot Salako-Oyedele, his deputy, identified alcohol consumption by drivers as one of the factors responsible for accidents on the highways. The Governor said, “All-inclusive style and as measures to avoid unnecessary conflict a transition committee was set up in the transportation sector to be able to manage the smooth transition between the previous executives and the present executives that will work with the government. “Our government is committed to good governance and what has happened in this sector is a clear example of his style of doing things. In order for all our plans to come to fruition, the security and safety of people in the state is very important and that is why we engage regularly with members of the transport sector to be able to work together to achieve our aims,” the Governor said. While appreciating the efforts of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) and TRACE, who work on the road to educate people so as to reduce accident, the Governor said most of the highways in the state are federal roads and are high traffic roads, which many drivers go on a very high speed, resulting into accidents. He, however, urged the participants especially the drivers, to take advantage of the seminar, saying the life, safety and wellbeing of the passengers they carry around lies on them.

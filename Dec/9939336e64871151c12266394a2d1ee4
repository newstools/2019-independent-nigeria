ABUJA – The upper chamber of the National Assembly on Thursday appealed to the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Abubakar Adamu, to as a matter of urgency reduce the number of checkpoints on federal highways in the country. The Senate said that reducing the checkpoints will reduce gridlock on the roads. The Senate also urged the Inspector General of Police to direct his men to eschew all forms of extortion on motorists as alleged, while carrying out stop and search to establish validity of vehicle particulars. The resolutions were sequel to the consideration of a motion sponsored by Senator Chukwuka Utazi (PDP, Enugu North). Coming under order 42 and 52 of the Senate standing rules, Senator Utazi, in his motion titled, “National Security versus Disproportionate Road Checkpoints on Federal highways in the country,” said that the national security architecture of Nigeria has been stretched beyond its elastic limits. He said that the acts of criminalities have put untold pressure on the country’s national security architecture, necessitating and compelling security agencies to confront security breaches headlong. Explaining that the act of criminalities necessitated the imposition of road checkpoints on almost all federal highways in all geo-political zones of Nigeria, the lawmaker said while road blocks are necessary to curb criminal activities, its abuse for unintended purpose is reprehensible. He stated that the Senate “will not renege in our responsibilities when the masses of this country complain that government police meant to protect them have been turned into an oppressive conduct by those concerned and which the IGP and people of his ilk may not be aware.” Meanwhile, the Senate has referred President Muhammadu Buhari’s request for the confirmation of the appointment of the Chairman and Members of the National Hajj Commission to its Committee on Foreign Affairs.

ASABA – Delta Governor, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa, has condemned the gunmen’s attack on former President Goodluck Jonathan’s home at Otuoke in Bayelsa State, describing it as pathetic and shameful. He revealed that the former President had on several occasions said his ambition was not worth the blood of any Nigerian. In a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Olisa Ifeajika, in Asaba, the governor said the incident was disturbing and unwarranted, noting that it was more condemnable because the former President was a peace loving man who always preached peaceful political engagements.

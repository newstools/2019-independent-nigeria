ABUJA – Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI), on Thursday, unveiled a portal that would show the owners and the ownership structure of all oil and gas assets in Nigeria at no cost. Speaking at the unveiling of the beneficial ownership portal, Executive Secretary of the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI), who stressed that the portal was not designed to witch hunt anyone, said organisations running legitimate businesses have nothing to fear. While noting that the free register/portal already has owners of licenses in the mining sector as well as owners of assets and companies in the extractive sector uploaded in it, maintained that the portal would be updated and upgraded periodically. In his words: “Knowing who-owns-what, especially in a sector given to opacity, is a significant development. It is also a win-win. It is good for resource-rich countries like ours. It is good for the citizens of such countries. And it is good for legitimate businesses.”

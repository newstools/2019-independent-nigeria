LAGOS – The Nigerian airline operators have been advised to evolve good and sustainable business plans in order to remain in operation.They were also advised to collaborate with one another, pull resources, rather than go it alone. Capt. Mohammed Abdulsalami, the Rector of the Nigerian College of Aviation Technology (NCAT), Zaria stated this yesterday at the Murtala Muhammed Airport (MMA), Lagos during an interaction with aviation journalists. He observed that most of the airlines in the country lacked good business plans, while those with such plans failed to implement them. He further stated that for them to succeed in the competitive industry, they had to join the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and other international alliances, warning that without this, the airline would be unable to compete with their counterparts in the industry. He said: “A lot of airlines in Nigeria didn’t succeed because they didn’t have very good business plans and where they have a good business plans, they don’t follow them. And, they all try to do it alone. This industry has evolved. The days of being on your own has gone. “That is why if you look around you, we have these major alliances; OneWorld, Start Alliance and others. Also, you can’t operate successfully as an airline without belonging to the International Air Transport Association of Nigeria (IATA). Most of our domestic airlines seem to be shying away from that. They don’t want to join IATA. “There is need for cooperation among the airline operators. They can do a lot more together, thereby saving money. They can share resources, help each other out, instead of trying to drive each other out of business.” The aviation industry in Nigeria has been bedeviled with challenges in recent time ranging from high cost of aviation fuel, unfavourble operating environment and the difficulty in assessing aircraft for leasing.

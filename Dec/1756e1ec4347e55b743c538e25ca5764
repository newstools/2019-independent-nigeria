The Federal Competitive and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) yesterday urged the media to always hold it and other regulatory agencies accountable for the sustainability of the campaign for the protection of rights of Nigerian consumers. Mr. Babatubde Irukera, the Executive Director of FCCPC, who made the declarations while addressing media executive in Lagos, said media engagement is critical to his administration’s priorities, “because of the role and place of the media in the crusade for an enhanced consumer protection in Nigeria”. ‘’We want you (media) to hold us accountable. We want you to engage us always and you are the one that will enforce the marriage between regulatory bodies, to ensure that things work out. “We want you to analyse us, engage us, advise us and put us under pressure for the benefits of the nation,’’ Irukera said. Irukera who underscored the need for sustained media input in the campaign for the protection of rights of Nigerian consumers, said many Nigerian are beginning to know their right and ways to enforce it. He said before he became the Director General of the agency, the agency received between 700 to 1,000 complaints every year, but now it received about 1,000 complaints every week. This, according to him, shows that the awareness has been created, adding that the agency resolve complaints every single day. “The change we desire in the media is as regards citizens’ obligations and rights; we need pragmatic collaboration with the media to change the society and make the difference in consumers’ lives. “The media has roles to play in the campaign to promote consumer protection and awareness; and should modify business behaviours in favour of the citizens ‘’Before I became the Executive Director , the agency was receiving between 700 and 1,000 complaints every year, but now , we receive about 1,000 complaints on a weekly basis.”

ILORIN â€“ Supporters of Abdulraheem Agboola, a candidate of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the March Kwara House of Assembly election who the court recently adjudged winner of the election and ordered to be sworn in on Tuesday protested over alleged refusal of the House to swear him in. Agboola who contested for the seat of the Ilorin South constituency had obtained this court judgment after the Appeal Court annulled the election of the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the election, Hassan Abdulazeez. Since he was issued the certificate of return by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) last week in accordance with the court order, Agboola was said to have made three attempts to meet with leadership of the House for documentation and, subsequently, swearing-in. When he made his third attempt on Tuesday he was still not allowed to come into the premises of the House as a delegate of the members of the House met with him at the gate reportedly long after he and a number of his supporters who accompanied him had waited.

UYO – Akwa Ibom federal lawmak­er, Mr Onofiok Luke, has said the granting of operational licence for the Ibom Deep Seaport to begin operations will solve the Apapa gridlock problem and aid economic development across Nigeria. Addeessing a town hall meeting for Etinan/Nsit Ubi­um/Nsit Ibom Federal con­stituency at Etinan Coumcil Secretariat, Luke called on the Federal Government to pri­oritise the licensing of Ibom Deep Seaport. He debunked claims against granting licence for the operations of the seaport, saying they were unfounded, and noted that development should not be politicised. “My voice, that of nine of my colleagues in the House of Representatives, three Senators in the Senate to begin to articulate strongly on the need for the Federal Government to see why they should give us license for the establishment of Ibom deep Seaport. “I am using this opportu­nity to plead with Nigerians, that the time has come that we must not do politics with de­velopment. The fear of grant­ing license for the operation of the Ibom Deep seaport is unfounded. “I am urging the Federal Government to use the Min­istry of Transport to make sure that, as we have been articulating in the House of Representatives, that there is need for us to be given that license. “It is the belief of all well-meaning Nigerians that we will be able to solve the challenge of the Apapa grid­lock that we have in Lagos,” he stated. Luke said the town hall meeting was designed to brief the constituency of his six months achievements in the House of Representatives and to listen to their problems.

Chelsea strengthened their grip on fourth place in the Premier League with victory over Tottenham in a bad-tempered game as Antonio Rudiger allegedly suffered racist abuse. Brazil forward Willian opened the scoring when he cut in from the left flank and superbly curled the ball beyond the reach of Paulo Gazzaniga. Willian added a second from the penalty spot shortly before half-time when the video assistant referee determined Gazzaniga had clattered Marcos Alonso after racing off his line. Spurs were reduced to 10 men shortly after the hour mark when Son Heung-min was shown a straight red card for petulantly kicking out at Rudiger. Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga was struck by a bottle thrown from the crowd while Rudiger gesticulated to suggest that he had been abused. Spurs responded with three announcements over the public address system that stated racist behaviour was interfering with the game. Chelsea’s victory – Frank Lampard’s second as a manager over his one-time boss Jose Mourinho – left them four points clear of fifth-placed Sheffield United while Spurs remain seventh.

The Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, yesterday disclosed that Nigeria has met the 100 per cent target agreement entered into by Oragnisation of petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and 10 Non-OPEC Member States. Sylva, who made the disclosure in a statement issued by his Spokesman, Alhaji Garba Muhammad, in Abuja on Sunday, said OPEC and10 Non-OPEC Member States are also known as the OPEC plus or the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) Countries. The minister spoke in a tele-conference with the Chairman of the OPEC-Non-OPEC Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) and Minister of Energy of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Prince Abdulaziz Bin Salman Bin Abdulaziz AlSaud and some other DoC Ministers over. He recalled that at the last meeting of the JMMC held in September, in Abu Dhabi, he assured that Nigeria would within three months be 100 per cent compliant with the Agreement that it had voluntarily entered into. Sylva emphasised that in fulfillment of that pledge, Nigeriaâ€™s compliance level had witnessed tremendous progress month by month since August resulting in 100 per cent compliance in November. The minister commended member countries of the DoC that had consistently met and even exceeded their targets of production cuts. He attributed the successes achieved in bringing stability to the oil market to the whole group, but especially due to the extra efforts of these countries. He commended the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for the extra burden it had taken on its own volition to help stabilise the global oil market.

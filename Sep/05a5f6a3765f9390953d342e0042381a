LAGOS – Emeka C. Kalu, the Director General of Atikulated Agenda Worldwide (TAW) and Global Initiative for Good Governance (GIFGG), has lamented weekend’s kidnap of Chief Kenneth Udeze, National Chairman of Action Alliance (AA), saying that Nigerians are no longer safe in the nation’s streets. Udeze, a lawyer, it would be recalled, was kidnapped in front of a Zenith Bank branch in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, where he was allegedly intercepted by gunmen in SUV, who claimed to be security agents and was driven to an unknown destination. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Kalu, who spoke to Daily Independent exclusively on Monday, maintained that security in Nigeria had become a cause for worry, even as he stressed the need for the Federal Government to declare a state of emergency to arrest the situation. According to him, “Declaring a state of emergency on security is long overdue as the trend has continued to worsen unabated, while the government of the day seems to be exhibiting lacklustre attitude towards this worrisome issue.” Kalu expressed worry that the security challenges in Nigeria had spiralled out of control and the silence of the President Muhammadu Buhari administration had pushed the citizens into a helpless situation. He said: “I am angry and worried at the same time. How can a man of the status of Chief Kenneth Udeze disappear in Abuja in broad daylight and up to this moment, there is no reliable update? It means that nobody is safe again in this country.”

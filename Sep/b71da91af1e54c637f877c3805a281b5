BENIN – Archbishop Margaret Benson Idahosa, Chancellor, Benson Idahosa University (BIU), Benin City, at the weekend declared that the university would continue to maintain zero tolerance for cultism, threatening that anyone who indulges in the act risks mental disorder. Dr. (Mrs) Idahosa made the declaration at the 15th Convocation of the university during which no fewer than 741 students were graduated on Saturday. BIU, she said, would never renege on its zero tolerance for cultism as any member of staff or student who indulges in the evil practice risks the tragedy of mental disorder. The Archbishop of Church of God Mission Intl. said BIU has zero tolerance for cultism and staff members and students who are predisposed to such a practice risk the tragedy of mental disorders being the curse the founder, Archbiship Benson Idahosa, had pronounced against those who insist on the practice and general godlessness. “On this occasion, this is a reminder to all not to be deceived as God cannot be mocked and it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God,” she said.

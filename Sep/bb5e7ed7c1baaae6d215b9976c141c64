EKITI – Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State has visited some communities and areas hit by flood in the state The governor, during the visit, said that his administration had commenced the dredging of major water channels in the state in a bid to prevent flooding in the state. Fayemi disclosed this in a chat with journalists shortly after inspecting flooded areas in Ado-Ekiti, the state capital, Ikere-Ekiti Eporo and Ogbese. Several communities were affected by flood following Friday night’s down pour. The areas include Oke Osun in Ikere Ekiti, Olujo
da zone 1 (Ado Ekiti), Ureje (Ado Ekiti), Elemi Afao Road Ado Ekiti, and Ogbese in IseOrun Local Government Area. Fayemi, who sympathized with the victims of the flooding, which overran some bridges and flooded some homes and farmlands, promised government’s support for the victims, adding that his government would leave no stone unturned in ensuring that flooding was curbed in the state. He assured that government would provide succour to those who were rendered homeless by the flood. While warning citizens against indiscriminate dumping of waste into the drains, the governor urged them to imbibe the maintenance culture and desist
from acts that were capable of endangering society. He added that anyone caught dumping waste into the drains would face the wrath of the law. Fayemi stated that government had desilted blocked drainages in virtually all parts of Ado Ekiti so as to give room for free flow of water and forestall flooding, but lamented that some citizens have not stopped dropping refuse in the drainages. At Ogbese, the bridge had been overrun by flood and had sacked residents living close to the riverbank. The governor interfaced with members of the community and said the flood was not unconnected with the lackadaisical attitude of the contractor handling the construction of Ogbese dam.

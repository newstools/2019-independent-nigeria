ENUGU – Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State on Monday inspected the collapsed mini-bridge at Monarch Junction, Ugwuaji, Enugu South Local Government Area, amid excitement in residents of the area. Ugwuanyi, who was applauded by the residents of the neighborhood for his commitment to the well-being of the people of the state and his timely visit to inspect the bridge built over a decade, was described as “a good man with a good heart”. Speaking through a resident, Pastor Noel Chiagozie Agu, who witnessed when the incident occurred, the people told the governor that the first term of his administration favoured them, stressing that was why they voted massively for him during the last governorship election. After the inspection and interaction with the jubilant residents, the state government promised to reconstruct the bridge to serve them better, and advised the residents to use the alternative road pending the completion of the project.

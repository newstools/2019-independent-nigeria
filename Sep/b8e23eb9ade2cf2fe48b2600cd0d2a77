LAGOS – Barcelona Femeni of Spain attacker, Asisat Oshoala has opined that her club will be able to use the experience of reaching last season’s UEFA Women’s Champions League final to go all the way again this time out, even as they begin their campaign against Italian champions, Juventus, who feature Nigerian-born attacker, Eniola Aluko in their squad. Heading into the first leg of her side’s battle with Juve, which Barca play away in Turin, Oshoala, who is fresh from helping the Nigerian women’s national team, Super Falcons, beat Algeria in an Olympic Games qualifier, declared emphatically that she and her club mates got wiser with their loss to Olympique Lyon of France in last year’s final. “Everything is about the experience. The team had an experience last year in Kazakhstan. “For this year, we will try to make sure we do not repeat the same mistake but correct what happened last year and try to get better. “I think facing a new team is always good because they have not faced us before. It’s vice versa. It’s the same for us and for them as well. “It’s difficult. You need some times to watch some of their games and all that but I think it bores down to team game. We play as a team and that makes it easier for us”, Oshoala told a leading Spanish magazine, Futfem.

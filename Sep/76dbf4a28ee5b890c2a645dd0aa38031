ABUJA – The Senior Programme Officer on Nutrition of Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Dr. Victor Ajieroh, has revealed that progress in reducing malnutrition over time has not moved in the right pace, despite efforts from government and partners. Ajieroh, who made this known in an interview with newsmen at the sidelines of the 49th Annual General Meeting and Scientific Conference of the National Society Nutrition (NSN), in Abuja, said: “We have seen some progress already, but a lot more needs to happen.” The theme of the conference, “Promotion of Nutrition for Sustainable Development: Current Trends and Innovation”, will help to address the issue of malnuntrition, which is extremely quite useful and insightful for promoting nutrition for sustainable development and as you known.” Ajieroh added that “the first thing is for us to appreciate the enormity of the challenge and as second to India, we have the largest number of malnourished children and the implications are very serious. It affects the cognitive development and capacity, which also impact on the economic productivity on the long run and also contributes significantly to mortality. According to him, “Government is committed to addressing that through policies, programmes, increased domestic financing and leveraging on partnership around that. So, what is crucial at this point in time, is to really come together and align the key priority, resource those priorities and programme to accelerate progress that will be what is critical to address some of these challenges. “We have signed up for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2030, and out of the 17 development goals, we have about 13 of them relevant for nutrition and we just have 11 years to go and so, it brings a strong sense of urgency and I hope that, this conference with this theme and from what we have heard from eminent Nigerians.

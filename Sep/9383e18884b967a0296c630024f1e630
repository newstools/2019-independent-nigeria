The Governors arrived the Rivers State Government House at about 6pm and proceeded to the official residence of Governor Wike where they held a closed door meeting with  the Rivers State Governor. Details of the meeting were not known as at press time, but this development may not be unconnected to the recent comments by the Rivers State governor. Governor Wike had a few weeks ago blasted the committee set up to investigate the circumstances surrounding the emergence of Hon Ndudi Elumelu as the minority leader of the House of Representatives, saying the committee was corrupt. Wike also stunned the PDP family and Nigerians in general when he congratulated President Muhammadu Buhari on his victory at the Presidential election tribunal.

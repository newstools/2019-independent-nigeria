Egyptian security forces rounded up hundreds of people, following small but rare anti-government protests, rights lawyers said Monday, as authorities moved to take harsh preventive measures against more unrest. Hundreds of protesters took to the streets in several Egyptian cities, including the capital, Cairo, over the weekend, calling for President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi to step down, Israel Times reports. All protests were quickly broken up by police. But they marked a startling eruption of popular dissent, which has been almost completely silenced in the past years by draconian measures imposed under Sissi. El-Masry said prosecutors questioned at least 220 people over claims that they took part in activities of an outlawed group, disseminating false news, misuse of social media platforms and taking part in unlicensed protests. Under Egyptian law, the accusations could land them in jail for years. Prosecutors did not immediately elaborate or offer evidence.

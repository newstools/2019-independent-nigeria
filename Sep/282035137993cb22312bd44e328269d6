LAGOS – The Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN), yesterday urged airlines and air travellers in the country not to panic over aviation fuel scarcity. The association said that its members have product in stock and would increase distribution. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Mr. Clement Isong, the association’s Executive Secretary, who disclosed this at a news conference in Lagos, dismissed reports that there was a challenge with the supply of the product in Nigeria. He explained that aviation fuel was a deregulated product, so marketers were at liberty to sell based on their cost price. “There is aviation fuel; there is no problem with it. Our members have it in their tanks. I am not sure why it is not available to airline operators,” he said. “l confirm to you that MOMAN members have Jet A1 product in stock and members have increased loading out and selling at our aviation storage tanks. “We (MOMAN) have also increased loading at our facilities at airports across the country, including our Joint Users Hydrant Installation at the Murtala Mohammed Airport in Lagos. He further assured domestic airlines and Nigerians of availability of aviation fuel in circulation as members commence massive distribution. He said that marketers had been assured of total support by the management of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) in ensuring massive distribution of aviation fuel across the country. Isong said that MOMAN was working closely with NNPC to ensure that the lingering challenges were addressed and the Nigeria aviation operations normalised.

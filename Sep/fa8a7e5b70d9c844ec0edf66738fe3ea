Paul Pogba is determined to leave Manchester United during the January transfer window, according to reports. The Sun writes that the Frenchman has become dispirited at Old Trafford and doesnâ€™t want to be blamed for their failures with the club stuck in a downward spiral. United needed penalties to get past League One outfit Rochdale on Wednesday but Pogba was not among the five takers as they won the shootout 5-3. He was also overlooked for the captaincy as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer handed the armband to youngster Axel Tuanzebe. It is understood that there is no chance of Pogba agreeing to a new deal with the Red Devils and his current contract is due to expire in 2021, although United have the option to extend for a further year.

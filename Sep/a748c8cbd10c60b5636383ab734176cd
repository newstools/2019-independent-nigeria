The death toll from a mysterious vaping illness has now risen to five, the Los Angeles Times reported. The sickness linked to vaping, which includes symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath and vomiting, has sprung up in 450 cases across the country, puzzling health officials. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Though vaping has been identified as a common denominator in the illnesses, it remains unclear what exactly is causing the outbreak. The California vaping victim was a person over 55 with other health problems, local officials told the paper. Health officials have warned Americans to avoid using vapes and e-cigarettes until they get a better handle on the issue. “While the investigation is ongoing, CDC has advised that individuals consider not using e-cigarettes — because as of now, this is the primary means of preventing this severe lung disease,” Dr. Dana Meaney-Delman, a CDC official overseeing the disease said in a statement to the Times.

IBADAN – After two years, the Senate of the University of Ibadan has lifted a ban placed on student union activities.
The decision to lift the ban was reached at the Senate meeting of 30 August during which the Dean of Students, Professor I. A. Abiona, made a passionate appeal to lift the ban to allow for the conduct of elections for the student body during the 2018/2019 session.
The Senate of the University of Ibadan had on 30 May 2017 suspended student union activities till further notice following a protest over the delay in the issuance of digitized identity cards.
In the proposal to lift the suspension, Abiona stated that 140 persons were tried in connection with the protest by the Students’ Disciplinary Committee with some receiving sanctions while others were acquitted.
According to him, the Student Affairs Division would ensure that a purposeful leadership of students emerged by raising the bar of eligibility, organisation of pre-election workshop and post-election leadership retreat for winners.
Abiona noted that most of the former union leaders fingered in the protest had shown remorse and have indicated the desire to uphold the rules and regulations and cooperative with the university administration.

LAGOS – SD Huesca of Spain midfielder, Kelechi Nwakali is taking delight from his massive impact in an outing with Nigeria’s Under-23 national team, Olympic Eagles, in Tuesday’s 5-0 victory over Sudan, and declared that it was another opportunity for him to improve his style of play. The Chile 2015 FIFA U-17 World Cup-winning captain, who joined Huesca from Arsenal of England this summer, after several years of going out on loan from The Gunners to Holland and Portugal, said he was happy that he was able to put in his own quota in helping Nigeria reach this year’s Africa U23 Cup of Nations (AFCON), billed for Egypt in November. ”It is always an honour to represent Nigeria. Of course, I am still knocking on the door of the Super Eagles, that’s why we keep playing every day. I believe my own is to do the playing and whenever it is time for me to come I am always available. “Personally, I take every game to improve myself, I know that footballers we can have bad days but we try all our possible best to make every game count for us. “The only thing I have to say is that the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) should support the team. The main thing first is to go there to pick up the ticket to the Olympics, even if we don’t win the competition, picking up the ticket is the most important thing, so one step at a time”, he said It would be recalled that after getting two assists and generally boosting the Olympic Eagles in Tuesday’s game at Stephen Keshi Stadium, Asaba, Nwakali received several rave reviews from football pundits and fans at the stadium.

ABUJA – The Presidential Support Committee (PSC) yesterday described as absurd the barrage of criticisms trailing the Rural Grazing Area (RUGA) scheme, saying the policy will end insecurity in the country. The PSC added that call for President Muhammadu Buhari to “completely scrap” the suspended programme is unconstitutional. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The PSC was reacting to recent reports in which the President of Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Dr Supo Ayokunle, as well as top members of the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria and other Christian bodies, including the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye were said to have asked President Buhari to completely scrap the Ruga scheme. PSC, in a statement by its Director of Communication and Strategic Planning, Mallam Gidado Ibrahim, regretted that a programme mapped out by the federal government as part of solutions to the farmers/herders clashes is being confronted by fierce opposition mounted by religious leaders who ought to be mobilising support for the scheme.

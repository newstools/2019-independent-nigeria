GUSAU – Zamfara State Governor, Bello Mohammed Matawalle has alerted that credible intelligence report has revealed plans by some disgruntled politicians in the state in connivance with Boko Haram elements to destabilize the state. Governor Matawalle who spoke through his press secretary, Mr.Idris Yusuf said the power-drunk politicians for sinister and personal gains have perfected plans with the dispersed elements of Boko Haram in the state to launch a series of attacks on innocent and peace-loving people of the State. This according to him was meant to scuttle the relative peace currently being enjoyed as a result of the peace and dialogue processes initiated by the present administration. The governor revealed further that the intelligence report showed aside plans to launch attacks on seven local government areas of the state and in other strategic places within the state capital, the perpetrators equally planned two important personalities in the state for elimination should this dastardly act succeed. He noted that the targeted local governments include Gusau which doubles as the state capital, Tsafe, Talata Mafara, Anka, Zurmi, Maru and Maradun. The strategic places targeted are Gusau Central Mosque and Gusau Mammy Market where soft targets are known to gather both at day and night. The Boko Haram elements were said to have been recruited from far and wide to carry out these heinous acts slated for Monday 23rd September to 25th October 2019. Governor Matawalle who has since prioritised Security of lives and properties of his people says he finds it very imperative to alert the people of the state, especially people living within targeted local government areas to be very vigilant, wary and watchful and promptly report to the Security agencies nearest to them in the State acts that seem suspicious for Immediate action.

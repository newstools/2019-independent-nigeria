Officials in the Bahamas have dropped the estimate of people missing in the aftermath of Hurricane Dorian to 1,300. Still, the White House says it is not planning to give islanders temporary protected immigration status. The Bahamas’ National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) on Thursday updated its official list of missing people in the wake of the worst hurricane in the islands’ history. NEMA officials said that 1,300 people are currently missing, down from Wednesday’s estimate of 2,500. “The number of people registered missing with the Bahamas government is going down daily,” said NEMA spokesman Carl Smith at a Thursday news conference. Hurricane Dorian slammed into the northern Bahamas more than a week ago, with winds reaching 295 kilometers per hour (185 mph) causing widespread devastation. NEMA spokesman Carl Smith said it would be possible to reunite some survivors with loved ones as soon as information had been cross-referenced. “This list has not yet been checked against government records of who is staying in shelters or who has been evacuated,” Smith said.

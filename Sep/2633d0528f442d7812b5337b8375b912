ASABA – Delta State University, Anwai campus in Asaba, Delta State was thrown into sober mood and panic, on Monday, as an unidentified middle-aged man and three others sustained severe injuries as they fell off from a building under construction at the campus. The incident occurred while the victims were working on the lecture hall of the school under construction. The campus was initially thrown into confusion as news of the collapsed building spread like wildfire alleging that the victims were non-teaching staffs and students of the institution. As the confusion brought learning activities to a halt it took concerted effort of anti riot policemen drafted to the campus to maintain law and order and pacify the aggrieved students to shelve the protest. Meanwhile, the Commissioner for Higher Education, Prof. Patrick Muoboghare who visited the scene of the incident lamented the situation. He disclosed that the family of the deceased has been contacted while the injured persons have been rushed to the Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Asaba for immediate treatment. While construction is still ongoing at the site, he stated that the incident called for an investigation, saying “We will follow up the matter. “We will instruct our engineers to take a proper look at the site to ensure safety and prevent future occurrences” He added, “We need to carry out a proper investigation as to what led to the fall that resulted in the death of the victim and others who were injured”.

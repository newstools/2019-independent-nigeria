AWKA – Governor Willie Obiano’s inability to keep his campaign promise of completing the 30- kilometre Amansea -Ebenebe–Ugbenu-Ugbene-Awba Ofemili Road started by his predecessor, Peter Obi, has been described as a great betrayal by leaders of the area. Dennis Ngene, who was former chairman of Awka North Local Government Area of the state, spoke on behalf of leaders of the area, lamenting how during his campaign, Obiano visited the area and promised to not only complete the road but extend it to Omor in Anambra East Local Government Area. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network According to Ngene, when Obiano visited the area on campaign especially for his second term in office, he warmed himself into their hearts when he said that people of Awka North belong to Igbo Adagbe (underdeveloped) people just like his own people so that he will give them the sense of belonging. However, as years rolled by, Ngene said there was no sign of building the road. “So, we sent a delegation to government to remind them of the road and they said work will commence during the dry season. “Between then and now, tell me how many dry seasons have passed? He asked. He lamented that Awka North was generally an agricultural and food producing area and within the capital territory. Now, he continued, they cannot even evacuate their farm produce. He added: “Since two months ago, some of us have not gone to our communities because the road has been cut off.”

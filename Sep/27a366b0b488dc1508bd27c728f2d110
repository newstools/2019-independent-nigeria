A couple have been stranded while on holiday in France after their car keys fell into a pedal-boat lake. Angharad Carrington-Edmunds and her husband Jack have been stuck in the north of France since Monday with their two young daughters.Locked in the car were their possessions and cash. Their four month-old’s christening had to be cancelled and Mr Carrington-Edmunds, who is self-employed, has missed out on a week’s work. While staying at a Eurocamp in northern Brittany, the family from Crickhowell, Powys, were on a boat at the resort when their daughter accidentally knocked a bag and the car keys fell in the lake. Solicitor Mrs Carrington-Edmunds, 30, said her husband stayed on the lake until it was dark, using nets, in a bid to try and find the keys. The family have travel, breakdown and car insurance but hit walls with their providers before finally resolving the problem, prompting Mrs Carrington-Edmund to warn people to check their policies.

She said they took out car insurance with the AA and also pay for a premium account with Nationwide to get insurance but both claimed they would not be covered because there was not “an obvious threat of the vehicle being stolen”. However, she said her “solicitor side came out” and she asked them to send over her policy wording but they backed down saying they “misread the policy”.

P/HARCOURT – Oil companies have been urged to respect the memoranda of understanding signed with host communities of the oil mining license, OML 25, in Kula Community of Akuku Toru local government area of Rivers State to ensure peaceful and productive operations. The state governor, Nyesom Wike made this call on Saturday, when he received the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Silva; the Group Managing Director of Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mele Kyari, and the Managing Director, Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), Osagie Okunbo, at the Government House, Port Harcourt. Wike declared that his administration would continue to develop the right environment for all investors to operate in the state. “The oil companies should also respect the Memoranda of Understanding signed with the host communities. “As the SPDC goes in, whatever they have agreed with the communities should be implemented. If they implement it, they will do their work. If they don’t implement, there will be another round of crisis. And then, they will call government to come in. “Ours is to make sure that people carry out their businesses in a very conducive environment. This is the role the Rivers State Government will always play,” he said. In his remarks, Silva expressed happiness over their visit to the state to celebrate the return of peace to the OML 25 and the host communities. “This is a good signal and we should deepen it. The Niger Delta has struggled for peace. We have lost more than we have gained,” Silva said.

Calabar – The petition of Senator Victor Ndoma-Egba SAN of the All Progressives Congress- APC challenging the Election of Senator Sandy Onor of the People’s Democratic Party- PDP, the 1st respondent; senator representing Cross River Central senatorial district has been dismissed and judgment decided in favour of the respondents. Reading the judgment on behalf of the three-man Tribunal, Justice Vincent Agbata noted that petitioner’s argument that he was unlawfully excluded by the Independent National Electoral Commission INEC from due participation in the election of 23rd February failed because INEC acted within the ambit of the rule of law in obeying the order of a Federal High court judgment in delisting the name of the petitioner as candidate of the APC. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The Tribunal judge noted that the APC was unarguably at war with itself and had several pre-election litigations one of which gave rise to the exclusion of their candidates in the election which the Tribunal averred as a lawful act since there was no superior order of the court to that lower court which ordered the exclusion. The Tribunal noted that the Appeal court order of February 20th, 2019 which directed that a status quo be maintained by parties means the situation as at the date order given and not before February 11, 2019, when the Federal High Court judgment was given. Moreso, the Tribunal viewed the petition as situated under the jurisdiction of the pre-election matter being that the exclusion act by INEC, took place before the election. It was also contended that the petitioner by the eye of the law was not validly the duly nominated candidate of his party at the time of the election being that he was lawfully excluded. Responding to the Tribunal ruling, counsels to the respondents and the petitioners represented by Patrick Akan Esq and Efiom Ekong Esq respectively accepted the Tribunal judgment. The Tribunal in a second judgment of the day also upheld the election of PDP’s Hon. Chris Agibe member representing Ikom-Boki Federal constituency in the National Assembly by dismissing the arguments of the petitioner; APC’s Victor Agban which pleaded unlawful exclusion.

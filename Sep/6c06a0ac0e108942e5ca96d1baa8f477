A fluke own goal and strikes by Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino helped Liverpool see off Burnley at Turf Moor as they maintained their 100% start to their Premier League campaign. The Clarets had fought toe-to-toe with last season’s runners-up until the 33rd minute when Trent Alexander-Arnold’s seemingly intended cross to the far post brushed the back of Chris Wood and sailed over the head of the stranded Nick Pope in goal. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Another piece of misfortune occurred soon after the restart. This time Burnley skipper Ben Mee inadvertently found Reds forward Firmino with a short pass; he then found Mane who fired low past Pope. There were few chances after the break, but Liverpool converted the clearest of them when Firmino fired in from the edge of the area after he was teed up by Mohamed Salah. Burnley, who have now won just two of their past 17 matches against Liverpool in all competitions, drop down to 11th in the table. The Reds, on the other hand, go into the international break with as many points and in the same position as the corresponding period last season. In other matches Southampton played 1-1 draw with Man United while Sheff United forced Chelsea to a 2-2 draw at the Stamford Bridge. Crystal Palace defeated Aston Villa 1-0, Leicester beat Bournemouth 3-1, Man City walloped Brighton 4-0, Newcastle drew 1-1 with Watford, West Ham beat Norwich 2-0.

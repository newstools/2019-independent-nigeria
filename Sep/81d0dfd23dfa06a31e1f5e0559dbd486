Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane said that club president Florentino Perez could still make one or two big name signings before Spain’s transfer window shuts on Monday evening. Madrid have spent over €300 million on new players this summer including €100m to bring Eden Hazard from Chelsea, but have so far been frustrated in attempts to sign Paul Pogba from Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain’s Neymar. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Asked if Perez has another “bomb” ready for deadline day, Zidane told a news conference that “anything can happen.” “We will see until Monday at 12,” Zidane said with a smile. Anything can happen. A bomb, two bombs…. We will see.” Leaving Madrid for PSG on Monday will almost certainly be goalkeeper Keylor Navas, with sources having told ESPN FC the Costa Rica international will move in an exchange deal with the Ligue 1 side’s Alphonse Areola. “It could happen, but the important thing is to have him tomorrow when he can help us win the game,” Zidane said when asked to confirm if Navas was departing. “And then, until [September] 2nd, anything can happen. But tomorrow he is with us, for an important game. I just focus on that. Nothing else.” On his return as Madrid coach last March Zidane promised “changes” and a “second project,” but with Hazard injured his team has remained basically the same, and players he wanted to sell like Gareth Bale and James Rodriguez still involved.

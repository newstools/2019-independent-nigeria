Mauro Icardi is suing Inter Milan for discrimination, claiming €1.5 million in damages and to be allowed back into the first-team fold. In published extracts from the legal document Icardi alleges the club took “clearly discriminatory” action against him. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The forward said that apart from being dropped from advertising campaigns and the team photoshoot for this season’s new jersey, he was also forced to train separately from the first team (after warming up together) and excluded from specific training sessions for forwards, directed by Inter coach Antonio Conte. Icardi also said he was excluded from the team’s WhatsApp group which is where players are told about the training schedule. Instead, the information on the timings is being sent to him privately. It was also highlighted that the No. 9 jersey was taken away from Icardi “despite him having signed 124 goals in that jersey in the past five seasons.” That jersey was given to Inter’s new record signing, Romelu Lukaku. Inter also recently signed another forward from Manchester United, bringing in Alexis Sanchez on loan. Icardi is suing to be allowed back into the full training sessions and claiming damages amounting to at least 20 percent of his salary, approximately €1.5m. “It’s not a question of money. What matters to Icardi is to be an integral part of Inter’s plans,” Icardi’s lawyer, Giuseppe Di Carlo, told Sport Mediaset on Saturday

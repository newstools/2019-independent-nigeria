Nissan Motor Co. and Carlos Ghosn will pay a combined $16 million to settle a U.S. regulator’s allegations that they failed to disclose more than $140 million in compensation that the automaker’s ex-chairman was slated to receive in retirement. Nissan was fined $15 million, while Ghosn, 65, was hit with a $1 million penalty, the Securities and Exchange Commission said in a Monday statement. The claims stem from a decision that allegedly gave Ghosn broad authority over pay decisions: Starting in 2004, the board delegated to him power to set compensation for executives and directors, including his own, Bloomberg reports. That led to Ghosn, with substantial assistance from his subordinates, excluding more than $90 million in compensation from Nissan’s public disclosures to investors, the SEC said. Ghosn also took steps to increase his retirement allowance by $50 million, according to the regulator.  Nissan said in a statement that it cooperated fully with the SEC and has “‘promptly implemented remedial acts to prevent recurrence.” Lawyers for Ghosn and Kelly said the decision to settle with the SEC should have no bearing on separate Japanese cases against their clients.

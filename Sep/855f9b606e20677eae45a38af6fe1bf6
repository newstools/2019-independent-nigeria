P/HARCOURT – Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, on Monday, directed the Governing Council of the Rivers State University, (RSU), to continue with the suspended employment exercise for academic and non-teaching staff. Commissioning the Rivers State University Students Union Building at the school premises, Wike explained he was compelled to suspend the exercise because of the negative issues that had trailed the suspension. “I suspended the process for the employment exercise due to the issues that emanated from it. The committee that I set up to investigate the process has turned in its report. “I am satisfied with the report of the committee. Therefore, I have informed the Pro-Chancellor to go ahead with the employment exercise “. Governor Wike said unlike other leaders, he has never interfered with admission and employment processes of any institution in the state, adding that his transparent approach to administration gives him the moral power to discipline erring officials. The Governor approved the construction of an ultra-modern Senate Building for the Rivers State University. He said that if the Pro-Chancellor and Acting Vice-Chancellor make the design available on time, the building would be completed by the first anniversary of his second term. He called on the Students Union Leadership to use the new facility to fight cultism, harassment of female students and examination malpractices.

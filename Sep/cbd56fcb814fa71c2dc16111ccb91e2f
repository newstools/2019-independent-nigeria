The Association of Senior Staff of Banks, Insurance and Financial Institutions (ASSBIFI) yesterday described the new policy on bank customers’ loan default with banks’ balances set off adopted by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) as commendable. ASSBIFI’s National President, Comrade Oyinkan Olasanoye, in an exclusive interview with DAILY INDEPENDENT, said: “As a strategic stakeholder in the financial sector of the nation’s economy, ASSBIFI fully welcomes this policy which is capable of strengthening the banking sectors now being weighed down by rising non-performing loan profile with its dire consequences on health of the banks and eventual job loss for our members”. Olasanoye, who argued that new policy is out to prevent or minimise loan defaults, noted that aside the bank-wide set off of loan balances, loan applicants would also be required to provide Bank Verification Number (BVN) and Tax Identification Numbers (TIN) as part of the new policy to prevent or minimise loan defaults. “We are aware that the new policy has spontaneously generated negative reactions from the public with some analysts claiming that the banks can only implement the directive with a legislation giving power of adjudication to the banks”, she said Olasanoye, specifically said: “In reality, there has always been a right of set-off within the bank and the present policy is only an extension of the well-known banking principle to cover the industry, and since CBN has explained that it will apply only to new loan applicants, the issue of seeking legislative backing does not arise.” The labour leader, however, urged the CBN to ensure faithful implementation of the Credit Protection Clause, as envisaged, and not to succumb to the negative antics of the loan defaulters masquerading as public analysts. It said the policy would clearly help in sanitising the system and boost confidence of banks to further enhance lending to the critical sectors of the economy while keeping a check on Non-Performing Loans (NPLS). It would be recalled that the adoption of the policy was announced at the end of the 345th Bankers Committee meeting held in Lagos on Monday, August 26, 2019. The CBN announced that it has approved the inclusion of a Clause in bank’s offer letters that mandates borrowers to agree that their loan balances would be set off with their other banks balances across the country.

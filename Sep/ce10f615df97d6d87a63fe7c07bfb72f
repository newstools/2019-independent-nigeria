ABUJA – Nigeria may be heading for another electricity crisis as Electricity Generation Companies otherwise (GenCos) have threatened to declare force majeure over attempts by the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Plc to takeover payments of gas supplied to thermal generation companies across the country. DAILY INDEPENDENT reports that when this happens the result may lead to gross inadequacy in electricity good generation that would result in short supply and darkness in the country. Dr. Joy Ogaji, the Executive Secretary of the Association of Power Generation Companies (APGC), who briefed journalists in Abuja, stated that NBET during a meeting with GenCos claimed that the directive came from the presidency, stressing that Gen- Cos would remain blameless for if they declared “force majeure” and release themselves of all market obligations. “The time may just be right for GenCos to declare force majeure and release themselves of all market obligations. Surely, GenCos will remain blameless for taking such actions” she said. Ogaji said crisis started when NBET, on September 13, 2019 issued a letter to individual thermal GenCos directing them to obtain, as a matter of urgency, their respective board approvals or resolutions, bequeathing responsibility for payment of gas and transportation to the respective supply companies for an administrative charge of 0.75 per cent. According to her, the letter gave each GenCo three working days ultimatum to respond CRUDE OIL PRICES WTI Crude 54.01 +0.02 +0.04% Brent Crude 62.99 -0.30 -0.47% Mars US 58.99 +1.40 +2.43% Opec Basket 60.88 -0.16 -0.26% Canadian Index 36.50 -0.18 -0.49% DME Oman 61.80 +1.63 +2.71% Urals 57.85 -1.50 -2.53% Mexican Basket 57.85 +1.76 +3.14% Indian Basket 60.14 -0.88 -1.44% with the board resolution or face non-payment of energy invoices. Ogaji, however, noted that NBET like other market participants was a licensee of National Electric Regulation Commission (NERC) and as such was expected to understand that in a regulated market, every expense must be backed by a regulatory approval for effective computation of the market tariffs. “The generation companies are not aware that such approvals have been issued by NERC nor is there any policy directive to this effect. “The fact that NBET is placing the extortionist 0.75 per cent administrative charge on GenCos who are already convulsing, in the NESI is an aberration on the duty of care placed on NBET. “It is curious to note that during a face to face meeting between NBET management and the GenCos, NBET claimed that: “It was directed by the Presidency to take over the processing of gas payment on behalf of the GenCos “It had approval to apply 0.75 per cent as administrative charges or cost on payment to gas suppliers” she said. She also lamented that the said 0.75 per cent administrative charge was compulsory as it was a Condition Precedent (CP) for GenCos to access the N600bn the Federal Government had approved for immediate payment to gas suppliers and GenCos.

The bursar Mr. Kumthi was suspended along with hundreds of other sensitive positions, while highly important lecturers left ADSU because of hash working conditions of service. The new Governor Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri concerned with the deplorable condition of ADSU decided to appoint an astute politician, Barrister A.D Tukur, as the chairman of the governing council of ADSU to reposition the university so that it would run its programs smoothly. Fintiri, who approved the constitution of the governing council for the institution, said he hoped that university’s lost glory which went down under former Governor Bindow and Prof Farauta Kaletapwa, the outgoing administrator of the ADSU who played a difficult role to further sink the repute of the university down by the massive migration of university dons seeking greener pasture in other universities. The council consists of Barrister A.D Tukur as chairman, Zira Maigadi and Kashim Nijjda, others are Mrs. Mary Sawa, Alh Zubairu Gabdo Toungo.

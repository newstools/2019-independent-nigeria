Ambassador Gilmore said in a meeting with Israeli Ambassador Talya Lador-Fresher and Israeli National Trafficking Coordinator Dina Dominitz. Ambassador Gilmore noted longstanding U.S. efforts to strengthen international cooperation in fighting trafficking in persons, as well as to work with other countries to ensure prosecution of traffickers, protection of trafficking victims, and prevention of trafficking in persons. Ambassador Gilmore highlighted U.S. efforts to bolster the work of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to combat trafficking and stated the OSCE was well placed to assist participating States fully implement their commitments. Noting Israel’s strong record in combatting trafficking in persons, Ambassador Gilmore recalled that Israel was ranked as a Tier 1 country – the highest rating – in the State Department’s 2019 Trafficking in Persons report.

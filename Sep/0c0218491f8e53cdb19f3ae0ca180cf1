Probe into Facebook came only two days after the search engine giant Google and its subsidiary YouTube agreed to pay a record $170 million to settle allegations by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the New York Attorney General that the YouTube video sharing service illegally collected personal information from children without their parents’ consent.

LAGOS – Last Wednesday’s judgment by the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal, which affirmed the election of President Muhammadu Buhari, has been described as a validation of the mandate freely given to him by Nigerians in the election. The Coalition of Oodua Self-Determination Group (COSEG), a Yoruba organisation, stated this in a statement signed by its chairman and publicity secretary of the coordinating council, Comrade Dayo Ogunlana and Dele Daramola respectively, and made available to newsmen in Lagos on Monday. The organisation, while joining several other Nigerians to congratulate President Muhammadu Buhari, stated that the election of the president for another term by Nigerians early in the year was based on his sterling performance in his first term, especially his anti-corruption fight. COSEG also maintained that the president by his disposition to governance has displayed uncommon commitment to the task of rebuilding the country, and also leading by example. The statement read: “We want to congratulate Mr President on his victory at the Presidential election tribunal. His victory to us is not by accident but rather a validation of the mandate for another four years given him by Nigerians. He is a democrat who has displayed uncommon commitment to the task of rebuilding this great country.

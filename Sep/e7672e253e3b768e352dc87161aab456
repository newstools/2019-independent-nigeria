OWERRI – The election petition tribunal sitting in Owerri, the Imo State capital has sacked Obinna Onwubuariri, a member of the House of Representatives. Until the nullification of his mandate, Onwubuariri was representing Isiala Mbano/Onuimo/Okigwe Federal Constituency of Imo State at the lower chamber of the National Assembly. DAILY INDEPENDENT recalled that Onwubuariri who hails from Amaraku was first elected into the House of Representatives in 2015. In her judgment, which lasted for almost two hours, chairman of the Panel, R. Harriman, ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to conduct a fresh poll for the federal constituency seat within 90 days from the date of the judgment. According to the jurist, the petitioner, Princess Miriam Onuoha of the All Progressives Congress (APC) was able to prove her petition beyond reasonable doubt. The jurist stated that INEC and the first respondent were unable to defend the allegations of over voting, mutilation of figures and reduction of the petitioner’s votes preferred against them by the petitioner. The panel, which ordered a fresh poll in the federal constituency, directed that the first respondent’s certificate of return be withdrawn immediately. Harriman said the declaration of the lawmaker who is a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) was done in utter disregard of the Electoral Act as amended. An aide of the petitioner, Israel Onyema, later told newsmen after the judgment was delivered that his principal won the election in the three local government areas that make up the federal constituency. The aide added that the sacked lawmaker said that his principal would appeal the judgment.

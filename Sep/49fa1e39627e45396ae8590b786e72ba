Lagos – The Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) yesterday implored President Muhammadu Buhari to give his new Economic Advisory Council ample scope, responsibility and authority to provide the much needed guidance and advice on policy choices in the country. LCCI, Director General, Muda Yusuf, who made the call, said the content and structure of economic policy will be greatly enriched if the president adheres to the rule. “This is the time to accelerate reforms, ensure fiscal consolidation, enthrone a market driven foreign exchange policy and promote a trade policy regime that is in consonance with the potentials and competitiveness of the Nigerian economy”, he said. Yusuf commended the president for setting up the council, saying the development will help to give the desired direction to the nation’s economic management. He said the stature, pedigree and the independence of the members of the council are clearly not in doubt. Speaking further, he said: “At a time like this, the economy needs such a team to pull the economy back from the brink. The management of the Nigerian Economy needs to be anchored on tested economic principles that will propel sustainable growth and development. The economy craves a critical mass of private sector investment to stem the current slide and declines in the economy.

Lagos – Providing quality diagnostic test reports in the least Turn Around Time (TAT) will enable doctors improve patients’ treatment, medical laboratory scientists have said.
They noted that about 50 per cent of samples sent from Nigeria to be tested in countries like India, South Africa, United Kingdom, America and Europe, increases the TAT that leads to delay in treatment, thereby increasing the prevalence of diseases.
The Managing Director, VCare Diagnostics, Sanjay Mathur, said these samples that leave Nigeria is one of the problems currently affecting the healthcare diagnostic space, noting that this causes delay of test results, thereby limiting the doctor’s ability to treat patients.
“Some of the results which are needed for diagnosis of patients get delayed because the Turn Around Time of results, which comes from any of these countries take about seven, 10 and sometimes 30 days for some of the tests report to come out,” he said.
In view of this, VCare Diagnostics Limited has said it would curb medical tourism in terms of diagnosis and overhaul the healthcare diagnostic system.
Mathur, who disclosed this at the launching of the company in Lagos State, said Vcare, the first state-of-the-art reference laboratory company, was established to fill key gaps that currently persist in the healthcare diagnostics space.
He said having diagnostic facilities in Nigeria, which performs about 95 per cent of the tests will fill the gap in the diagnostic space and enhance early treatment of diseases, as well as increase the country’s ability to become a reference laboratory point for Africa.
To achieve its vision of becoming the Go-To Reference Laboratory and ensuring that no samples leave Nigeria, the Managing Director said it is partnering with Techmed Healthcare to bring-in rich experience in the field of medical diagnostics and hospital laboratory management in Africa.

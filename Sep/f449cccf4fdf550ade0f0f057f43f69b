Iranian-made cruise missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were used in the 14 September attacks on the Abqaiq and Khurais oil facilities but were not launched from Yemen as claimed, Saudi military spokesman Colonel Turki al-Maliki said in a press briefing four days later. “The attack was launched from the north and was unquestionably sponsored by Iran,” he said. “The evidence throughout my display and briefing makes this undeniable.” The attack was claimed by the Iranian-backed Yemeni rebel group Ansar Allah (Houthis), which said it involved 10 UAVs of three different types – including two new ones – that were launched from three different locations.

OWERRI – The Imo State governorship candidate of the All Progressive Congress (APC) in the 2019 general election, Hope Uzodinma, has appealed the verdict of the Governorship Election Petition Tribunal, which last Saturday in a unanimous ruling affirmed the victory of Emeka Ihedioha of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) as state governor. Uzodinma, in his notice of appeal filed on September 24, 2019, in the Court of Appeal, Owerri, with petition no: EPT/GOV/IM/08/2019, claimed that the tribunal’s “judgment was against the weight of evidence”. He also prayed the court to sustain his appeal, set aside the tribunal verdict, direct the 3rd respondent (Independent National Electoral Commission) and to withdraw and issue him the certificate of return issued to the 1st respondent (Ihedioha).

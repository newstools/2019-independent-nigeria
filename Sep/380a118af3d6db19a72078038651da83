Hurricane Dorian intensified into a dangerous category 5 storm as it approached the Bahamas Sunday, expected to pound the islands with up to two days of torrential rain, high waves, and damaging winds before aiming for the U.S. mainland. Bahamas Prime Minister Hubert Minnis begged residents of Abaco and Grand Bahamas to head for the main island to escape the “devastating, dangerous” storm.

Lives cannot be replaced,” he told a news conference Saturday, adding that 73,000 people and 21,000 homes were at risk to storm surges, which are predicted to reach up to 20 feet (6.1 meters). The Miami-based National Hurricane Center (NHC) said Dorian had maximum sustained winds of 160 miles per hour (260 km per hour) early Sunday and was about 35 miles (55 km) east of Abaco, teleSUR reports. After churning over the Bahamas, it is expected to veer northwest toward Florida, with the NHC raising its alert Sunday for parts of the state’s east coast to a tropical storm warning. While not expected to strike Florida, the NHC said, “a Florida landfall is still a distinct possibility.” Communities further north in Georgia and South Carolina raised alert levels Saturday, with residents filling sandbags as authorities tested infrastructure and hurricane drills. Despite Dorian appearing to spare the United States a direct impact, the NHC warned the Category 5 storm on the five-step Saffir-Simpson Wind Scale would lash millions from Florida to the Carolinas with strong winds and punishing surf.

Former Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe died from advanced cancer and had already been taken off chemotherapy, Xinhua news agency reported his successor, President Emmerson Mnangagwa, as saying. Mnangagwa told supporters of the ruling party ZANU-PF in New York over the weekend that Mugabe had to be taken off the chemotherapy because it was no longer effective, the state-controlled Herald newspaper reported Monday. He is in the United States for the 74th session of the UN General Assembly. Mugabe died in Singapore on Sept 6 and his body was brought home on Sept 11. A funeral service attended by regional leaders was held at the National Heroes Acre on Sept. 14 and his body is now lying in state at his home in Harare while a mausoleum is being built for him at the national shrine. A Mugabe family source told the Sunday Mail that the family was now in charge of the funeral. Details of burial will be announced later.

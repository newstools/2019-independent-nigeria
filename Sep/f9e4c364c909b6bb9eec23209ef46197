Super Eagles Technical Adviser, Gernot Rohr, has released the list of 23 players for the friendly against Brazil in Singapore on October 13, 2019 with Captain Ahmed Musa missing due to injury. The injury ruled him out of the friendly against Ukraine earlier in the month. However, dispelling any insinuations, the Al Nassr in Saudi Arabia striker, in a reply to a fan request said, “Am injured that’s why,” he wrote on his official Twitter handle. However, in-form Granada of Spain midfielder Ramon Azeez and Czech –based forward Peter Olayinka made the list. Rohr also have defenders Kenneth Omeruo, Abdullahi Shehu and Chidozie Awaziem back from injury, otherwise the squad is largely unchanged from the side that was forced to a 2-2 draw by Ukraine in Dnipro on 10th September. Other defenders are Olaoluwa Aina, William Ekong, Jamilu Collins and Oluwasemilogo Ajayi. Goalkeepers Francis Uzoho, Ikechukwu Ezenwa and Maduka Okoye are retained, but England –based Leon Balogun and Russia –based Bryan Idowu are left out. Leicester of England’s Kelechi Iheanacho is left out, while Girondins Bordeaux’s Joshua Maja place is taken by new boy, Peter Olayinka. England –based midfielder Wilfred Ndidi also returns after missing the Ukraine encounter with injury. Alex Iwobi, Oghenekaro Etebo, Anderson Esiti and Scotland –based Joseph Ayodele-Aribo, who scored on his debut against Ukraine, are all back in midfield, with Victor Osimhen, Samuel Chukwueze, Moses Simon, Samuel Kalu, Paul Onuachu and Emmanuel Dennis all back in the frontline. Substantive captain Ahmed Musa is still down with injury. All invited players are expected to arrive in Singapore on Wednesday, 9th October.

A group of seven South American nations have joined a pact to safeguard the Amazon rain forest, which has been charred this summer by tens of thousands of wildfires — including blazes in Bolivia that have burned more than 4 million acres so far. The majority of the fires are burning in protected natural areas, prompting Bolivian environmental secretary Cinthia Asin to call for a disaster declaration. Other state departments are also pressuring the Bolivian government to take action. We insist on a national declaration of disaster, because we are losing a great part of our biodiversity that is also a water provider,” Asin said. Bolivian communication minister Manuel Canelas said the scope of the fires don’t yet warrant such a declaration.

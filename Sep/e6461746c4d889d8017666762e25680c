LAGOS – Senator Rochas Okorocha and immediate past governor of Imo State has demanded that Governor Emeka Ihedioha of Imo State open Imo International Cargo Airport for the benefit of Imo and South East people. Okorocha, in a statement made available to journalists on Monday by his media aide, Sam Onwuemeodo, stated that it had become necessary that Ihedioha opens the airport following plan by the Federal Government to close Enugu airport for upgrade and maintenance work. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The lawmaker appealed to Nigerians to advise Ihedioha to obey the voice of reason by opening the Imo International Cargo Airport built by him when he was the governor and commissioned by Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo. He said that it had become necessary following the Federal Government’s move to close the Enugu Airport for renovation works. He maintained that if Enugu airport should be closed that the next option for Imo and South- East people would be to use the Imo airport. The former governor said that Ihedioha should look beyond him (Okorocha) and see what the state and Imo people would benefit if the cargo airport was opened for operations. He maintained that even though he built the airport to open up Imo State for business to the rest of the world, the governor should take cognizance of the fact that the airport did not belong to him but Imo people whose money was used in financing the project. In a related development Okorocha said that Ihedioha should also be advised to allow the state judiciary move to the ultra-modern Justice Oputa High Court Complex, the police to the new police headquarters and the prisons to the new prisons headquarters along Aba Road. He said that it was a wrong move for the governor to abandon the gigantic projects built with taxpayers’ money.

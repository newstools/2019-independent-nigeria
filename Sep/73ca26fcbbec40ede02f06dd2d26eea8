ABUJA – The Managing Director of Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) Mr. Usman Mohammed, at the weekend, said the electricity distribution companies require about $4.3 billion worth of investment to meet up with the transmission capacity. Speaking at a TCN’s donor/stakeholders meeting in Abuja, Mohammed noted that the nation’s transmission capacity was now above 8000MW. He lamented that distribution companies in Nigeria are the worsts in terms of performance in the West African sub region, adding that Nigeria has handed its assets to inefficient people. Mohammed noted that there is urgent need to recapitalise the distribution companies for effective service delivery. The TCN boss disclosed that the total indebtedness of the 11 electricity distribution companies (Discos) in the country to the TCN now stands at about N270billion. The TCN boss, who stated that the company was working hard to attain self-sustainability in its operations, stated that the debts, if paid, would enable it pay multilateral donor agencies that loaned it monies to execute transmission projects. He, however, noted that the transmission company had reformed its project procurement and implementation processes and would be able to offset about $1.661 billion worth of loan it secured from multilateral agencies such as the World Bank and African Development Bank (AfDB) amongst others, to upgrade the national grid. “The Discos owe us N270 billion cumulatively as uncollectible debts. We can finance our operation and so all the loans we have been taking, we are now signing agreements with the federal ministry of finance that we are going to pay the loans by ourselves,” said Mohammed.

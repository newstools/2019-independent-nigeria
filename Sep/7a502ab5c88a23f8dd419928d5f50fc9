The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Editorial Board Community Development Service (CDS) group in Abuja on Wednesday, donated educational materials and snacks to Internally Displaced Persons at the new Kuhigoro IDP camp. The items donated to the IDPs included textbooks, notebooks, pencils, biros, crayons, cardboards, study posters, and snacks. Presenting the items, the NYSC CDS officer in charge of the group, Ms Yvonne Chinenye, noted that the items were to impact on the lives of children at the IDP positively. Yvonne added that such gestures should be emulated by other corps members as one of the essence of establishing the scheme. Chinenye said “IDPs are people like us, they need to be cared for as we are meant to touch lives of people wherever we are posted to.” Earlier in his address, the Vice President of the CDS group, Mr Mobolaji Davidson, said that the group felt there was need for them to make an impact in the lives of those in need. “Few months ago, the CDS group came to check on the IDPs and we found out that children at the camp lacked educational materials and also teachers in their school. “So we thought it wise to contribute our little quota to them as part of our community service and we want other groups to help in any way they can. “We also want to call on Nigerians to help them as they were in need of volunteer teachers,” he said. While receiving the items, Mr Luka Yathuma, the Camp Secretary, appreciated the corps members for their assistance and called on wealthy individuals to come to their aid.

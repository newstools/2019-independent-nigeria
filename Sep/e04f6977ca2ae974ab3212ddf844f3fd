Lagos – Nigeria’s sole survivor in the CAF Champions League, Enyimba of Aba, will today host Al Hilal of Sudan at the Aba Township Stadium in the first round of this year’s CAF Champions League. Both clubs will be meeting for the third time. The first time they met was at the group stage of the 2011 CAF Champions League where Enymba defeated them 2-1 in Omdurman but drew the reverse leg in Aba. However, the winner of this tie over two legs will progress to the lucrative group stage of the foremost continental club competition. While Enyimba were drawn by in the preliminary round, the Sudanese defeated Rayon Sport of Rwanda to set up a meeting with eighth-time Nigerian champions.

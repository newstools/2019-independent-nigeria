Japan announced Friday it will accept South Korea’s request for joint talks leading to arbitration by the World Trade Organization after Seoul filed a complaint with the international body over Tokyo’s tightening of export controls. Trade minister Isshu Sugawara, however, said Japan’s controls on exports to South Korea follow WTO rules and that Tokyo stands by its position. “We have decided to accept the negotiations requested by South Korea,” Sugawara said. “Japan’s position is that its review of trade controls is consistent with WTO rules and that there is no change to that. We will give South Korea a thorough explanation.” South Korea initiated a complaint with the WTO last week after a trade dispute between the neighbors erupted in July.

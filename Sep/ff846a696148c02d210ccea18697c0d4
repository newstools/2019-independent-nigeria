Ukraine ex-international striker and current head coach, Andriy Shevchenko has opined that Tuesday’s international friendly against Nigeria will be very interesting to watch, because he believes the visitors have a strong team.
He disclosed further that he decided to accept the friendly, despite his side being involved in the 2020 European Championship, because they need a different shade of tactics to play against.
While acknowledging that other European teams they could have played against are also busy in the qualifiers, Shevchenko added that he will love to see how his lads would comport themselves against a team from outside the continent.
He added that he was happy to see his players put three goals past Lithuania in their last fixture, which keeps them in firm control to qualify for the European Championship, and Shevchenko says he now has the opportunity to hand shirts to fringe players in his squad for the game against the Eagles, which will begin at Dnipro-Arena at 7:30pm Nigeria time.
Shevchenko told Football TV channel:”First of all, this is due to the fact that a lot of matches are being held now, there is a selection, and most teams are just participating in official matches.
”This date is not a day of friendly games, so finding a European opponent was very difficult. Therefore, the Association chose to play with the African team. This is a very good team. It will be interesting to play against them.”

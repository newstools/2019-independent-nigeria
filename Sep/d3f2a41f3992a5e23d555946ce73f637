Saudi Arabia will offer tourist visas for the first time from tomorrow, opening up the ultra-conservative kingdom to holidaymakers to diversify its economy away from oil. The Daily Mail reports that Visitors from 49 countries – including the UK, US, and Australia – will be able to apply for the visas starting on Saturday, the Saudi Commission for Tourism and National Heritage said Friday. Kickstarting tourism is one of the centrepieces of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s Vision 2030 reform programme aimed at preparing the biggest Arab economy for a post-oil era.

Opening Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country,’ Al-Khateeb said in a statement. ‘Visitors will be surprised… by the treasures we have to share – five UNESCO World Heritage Sites, vibrant local culture and breathtaking natural beauty.’ Visas in the desert kingdom, endowed with rich bedouin heritage and archaeological sites, are currently restricted to expat workers, their dependents and Muslim pilgrims travelling to holy sites in Mecca and Medina. In a rare move, Saudi Arabia last year began issuing temporary visas to visitors to attend sporting and cultural events in a bid to kickstart tourism. But the austere kingdom, which forbids alcohol and has a strict social code, is seen by many as a hard sell for tourists.

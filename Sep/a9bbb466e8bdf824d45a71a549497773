The president of Sri Lanka, Maithripala Sirisena, today appointed a five-member committee to investigate terrorist attacks with Easter Sunday bombs in various parts of the country, which killed more than 250 people. The committee is made up of two magistrates of the courts of appeal, equal number of retirees of the superior courts and a retired administrator. Allegations of not taking into account intelligence reports on the attacks and related errors that prevented the authorities from taking preventive measures will be investigated. The Committee also has the task of identifying the persons or groups that were responsible for acts of public unrest and vandalism following the terrorist attacks. The Sri Lankan president asked the Committee to submit its first interim report in three months, the News First website reported. A group of nine suicide bombers carried out on April 21 a series of explosions that destroyed three churches and many other luxury hotels in Sri Lankaâ€™s main city, Colombo, which killed 258 people. The local Islamist extremist group National Thawheed Jamaath (NTJ) was charged with the attacks.

On september 26th 2017 a freshly elected Emmanuel Macron gave a speech at the Sorbonne University in Paris. It lasted over one-and-a-half hours and argued for a hugely more ambitious eu. Amid poetic overtures about Europe’s common fate was a long list of proposals to integrate the continent more tightly, in order to toughen it up for a more demanding world. “European sovereignty requires constructing, and we must do it,” insisted the new leader. Yet now, on the speech’s second birthday and as Mr Macron nears the midpoint of his presidential term, his roster of European achievements is modest. The timing was poor. Delivered just after Germany’s federal election, the speech was meant to inspire the incoming government there. Yet the coalition talks dragged on; then the young German government was plunged into a squabble about immigration; then the anti-establishment gilets jaunes (yellow jackets) protesters took to French streets and mired Mr Macron in domestic matters. His approval ratings have recovered in recent months and Macroniste minds are once more turning to the European picture.

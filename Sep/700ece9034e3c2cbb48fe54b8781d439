Lagos – The presidency has debunked reports that it has stopped the Tradermoni scheme after the conclusion of the 2019 general elections. Some Nigerians have accused the Federal government of vote buying saying the scheme began shortly before the 2019 elections and was stopped after the victory of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in the presidential election. However, speaking in a chat with Saturday INDEPENDENT, Laolu Akande, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity in the office of the Vice-President said the scheme is still going on in every state of the federation. He said traders who benefited from the first phase of the programme and repaid the N10,000 loan have started collecting N15,000 collateral free loans  to improve their businesses. He added that after paying the N15,000, traders will get N20,000 and it will keep moving up until they get N100,000. “Tradermoni is going on in every state and has continued since inception. Some of the beneficiaries are now on the second level of N15,000 collateral free loans which they get after repaying the first level N10,000. When they repay the N15,000, they move to N20,000 and on and on until N100,000,” he said.

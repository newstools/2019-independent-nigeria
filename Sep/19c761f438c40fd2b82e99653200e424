Senator Hope Uzodinma, has commended President Muhammadu Buhari over the closure of Nigeria’s border with Benin Republic and other neighbouring countries to check rice smuggling.
Uzodinma, who spoke in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja, said it was evident of the president’s determination to get Nigeria working again.
He described the move as a right step in the right direction.
Uzodinna, the All Progressives Congress (APC) Governorship Candidate in the February 2019 election in Imo said, “it can only take a man who has the interest of his country and the political will to work his talk.”
Uzodinma, who was once Chairman, Senate Committee on Customs, said that his committee in the course of its oversight functions then, discovered the humongous amount of money the country was losing to rice smuggling and other illicit activities.
The Federal Government had on Aug. 21, ordered a partial closure of the borders to check smuggling activities around Benin, Niger and Chad Republics. Some of the smuggling routes around the country include Seme-Lagos in Lagos State, Jibiya in Katsina, Idiroko in Ogun, Illela-Koni in Sokoto State, Kabo, Saki, and Sikanda in Oyo State

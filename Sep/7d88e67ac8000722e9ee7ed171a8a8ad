Thomas Cook customers may have to wait as long as two months to receive a refund for holidays they have booked with the collapsed travel firm. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said direct debit customers would be refunded within 14 days but others would have to wait up to 60 days, BBC reports. Lucy Aydinalp said the delay meant her “dream holiday” to the Dominican Republic in November was now ruined. “I have three children who don’t get their holiday; it’s such a sad time.” Ms. Aydinalp from Manchester was a Thomas Cook employee for six years up until the collapse of the holiday firm. She is currently on maternity leave but previously worked in a Thomas Cook High Street store. The two-week holiday for herself, her partner and three children cost £3,500, including a staff discount. “Not only have I lost my job with Thomas Cook I’ve lost my holiday too. I am currently on maternity leave and I’m not getting any money any time soon which is a big worry for my family. Just living at the moment is not easy.” Ms. Aydinalp said even when she did receive a refund, it was likely she would have to pay “a substantial amount” more for a similar holiday because prices had now risen. She said the refund process should be faster. “I don’t think people are going to be able to rebook their holidays in time (if they have to wait two months).”

Germany and Bayern Munich No.1 Manuel Neuer has suffered injury issues in recent seasons, but remains defiant over his position regarding retirement from the game that has made him popular, insisting that he would only retire from football when he is no longer needed. The 33-year-old played just four times during the 2017-18 season due to a foot injury and suffered with a calf issue last term. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network After Germany’s 4-2 loss to Holland on Friday night, more questions have been asked about his place with Die Mannschaft, at a time when Bayern are also reportedly eyeing Schalke youngster Alexander Nubel as his potential long-term replacement at the Allianz Arena. But Neuer, who will win his 90th international cap against Northern Ireland on Monday night, remains defiant in the face of questions about his potential retirement – insisting he still has an important role to play. “When you are no longer needed and you feel it, it is difficult to get up and motivate yourself each day,” he told Welt am Sonntag.

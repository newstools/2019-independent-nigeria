Warri – A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Delta State, Hon. Kelly Otuedon, has lauded Governor Ifeanyi Okowa’s effort in spreading infrastructural development across the 25 local government areas of the state, describing him as a bridge builder. Otuedon, who addressed newsmen on Wednesday in Warri, contended that Okowa’s workaholic stance since he became the governor marked him out as one of the most performing governors since the creation of Delta State. He described the Asaba International Airport as one of the best in the country adorned with the state of the art facilities comparable to other international airports in the world. Otuedon, a member of the newly created Warri and Effurun Urban Development Agency, said the group who he said were made up of men of impeccable characters such as Dr. Joseph Sisan Otumara and Chief Macauly Ovo Zuorie as chairman and managing director respectively, would do a thorough job that would turn the area to another Dubai in Nigeria. Otuedon, the immediate-past Senior Special Adviser to Governor Okowa on Security Affair, lauded the existing peace that had been pervading the state over the years, stressing that the enduring peaceful co-existence in all the council area would be sustained. “It is no more news that Delta state is one of the peaceful states in the country, insisting that the peaceful atmosphere will be sustained,” he added. On road development, Otuedon, who was the two time chairman, PDP Uvwie Local Government Area, was elated by the massive rehabilitation of roads across the twenty-five council areas, adding, “That is why Okowa has been known as road master.”

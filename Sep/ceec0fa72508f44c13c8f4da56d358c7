Wahidi Akanni, a former Chairman of the Lagos State Football Association has given the condition upon which Nigeriaâ€™s senior team (the Super Eagles) can become as formidable as it used to be in the old days. According to the seasoned football administrator, raising a reliable National team that will command the respect and fear of other teams in Africa and other continental competitors is hinged on the proviso that the country up-scale its grassroots football. He said that neglecting football development at the grassroots would continue to affect the development and strength of the senior national teams.

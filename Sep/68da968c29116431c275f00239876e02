UMUAHIA – Following the crisis that engulfed Ahuwa-Oboro Autonomous Community in Ikwuano L.G.A of Abia State, some elders of the once peaceful community suspended the newly constituted caretaker committee and subsequently reinstated the “suspended” executive.
According to the elders, the leadership of the town union could only be chosen through a free and fair election in the community organized at its village square, adding that no group had the right to dissolve a properly constituted executive.
Fielding questions from newsmen in Umuahia on Sunday, some of the chiefs and elders of the community, who belonged to the Supreme Council of Ahuwa-Oboro Leadership Forum, warned against what they called the habit of a section of the people taking the peace and disunity that pervade the community for granted.
Chikezie Amaechi and Chief Ifeakachi Nwachukwu, who spoke on behalf of the elders and chiefs asked any member of the community interested in the leadership of the Ahuwa-Oboro town union to brace up for the position when the time came for an election, adding that anything contrary to that would spell doom for the peace and unity of the community.
It would be recalled that a last week announced the dissolution of the town union executive led James Nnadozie Uchegbuo and the establishment a caretaker committee to oversee the affairs of the union until an election was held.
The chiefs and elders frowned at the recent radio announcement concerning the leadership of the community and called on the group to present themselves for the office of the president general and executive members when the election comes.

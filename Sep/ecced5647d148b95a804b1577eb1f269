Oil prices gained more than 1 per cent to hit their highest levels in two sessions at the start of yesterday’s trade as Middle East tensions remained high supporting prices. The Pentagon has ordered additional troops to be deployed in the Gulf region to strengthen Saudi Arabia’s air and missile defence following an attack on Saudi oil facilities. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday that the troops were for “deterrence and defence” and Washington aimed to avoid war with Iran. Brent crude futures touched an intraday high of $65.50 a barrel, but eased to $64.97, up 69 cents later. The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were at $58.78 a barrel, up 69 cents, after earlier hitting a high of $59.39. In the United States, the impact of Tropical Storm Imelda on refineries in Texas has eased as Exxon Mobil Corp and Valero Corp restarted their crude processing units over the weekend. It would be recalled that oil prices gained in early Asian trade on Friday after days of turbulence, with markets soothed by Saudi Arabia’s pledge to restore full production by end-September at facilities knocked out in drone and missile attacks last weekend. Brent crude futures rose 8 cents to $63.68 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was up 12 cents to $58.23 a barrel. The gradual return of normalcy after a 2 per cent drop on Wednesday and a 14 per cent plunge on Monday, came after Saudi Arabia set out the timeline to full operation and also said it had managed to restore supplies to customers at levels prior to the attacks by drawing from its oil inventories.

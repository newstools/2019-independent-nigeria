President Donald Trump of the United States has confirmed that Hamza Bin Laden, the son and designated heir of Al-Qaeda founder, Osama Bin Laden, was killed in a counter-terrorism operation along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. He made the confirmation on Saturday, September 15, 2019. Recall that the US media had reported in late July and early August, citing intelligence officials, that Hamzat Bin Laden had been killed sometime in the last two years in an operation that involved the United States. The Secretary of Defense, Mark Esper, also confirmed the death last month, saying it was “his understanding” that Bin Laden was dead. However, it was noted that Trump and other senior officials o the White House did not publicly confirm the news. “Hamzat Bin Laden, the high-ranking al-Qaeda member and son of Osama Bin Laden, was killed in a United States counterterrorism operation in the Afghanistan/Pakistan region,” Trump said in a brief statement issued by the White House. “The loss of Hamza bin Laden not only deprives Al-Qaeda of important leadership skills and the symbolic connection to his father but undermines important operational activities of the group.” The statement did not specify the timing of the operation. The 15th of Osama bin Laden’s 20 children and a son of his third wife, Hamza, thought to be about 30 years old, was “emerging as a leader in the Al-Qaeda franchise,” the State Department said in announcing a $1 million bounty on his head in February 2019 – perhaps after his actual demise. Sometimes dubbed the “crown prince of jihad,” he had put out the audio and video messages calling for attacks on the United States and other countries, especially to avenge his father’s killing by US forces in Pakistan in May 2011, the department said. That work made him important in attracting a new generation of followers to the extremist group that carried out the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, which left nearly 3,000 dead.

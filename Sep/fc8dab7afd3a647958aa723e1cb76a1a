ABUJA – As the controversy generated by the alleged demolition of a mosque by Governor Nyesom Wike of Rives State, South- South Nigeria, Coalition of Northern Youth Organizations for National Integration (CONI) has berated the governor’s action and utterances. The body, which issued the condemnation at a press briefing on Monday in Abuja, also accused the Governor of persecuting Muslims in the oil rich state. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The group, while speaking through its national coordinator, Comrade Bashir Dauda Sabuwar, described the alleged demolition of Rainbow Town Central Mosque located at the Trans-Amadi Area of Port Harcourt as “illegal”, vowing to mobilize Nigerians against the governor’s attempt to persecute Muslims in the state. “The purpose of the conference is to mobilize patriotic, peace loving Nigerians, who believe in one Nigeria, who love justice, fairness and harmony against the governor of Rivers State, Mr. Nyesome Wike. Specifically, our concern today is on the illegal demolition of Rainbow Town Central Mosque located at the Trans-Amadi Area of Port Harcourt. “Given the utterances of the governor shortly before the illegal exercise in which he claimed that Rivers State is a Christian state, it is clear that there was more to it. Thus, the demolition was just part of the blueprint to not only persecute the Muslims in his state but also implement his agenda of turning Rivers into a homogeneous Christian state even at the detriment of our constitution, peace and justice. “The agenda to our understanding include divide and rule, to enable the governor manipulate religion to score cheap political feat and distract the good people of Rivers State from holding him accountable. Nigerians are wiser today”, the group said.

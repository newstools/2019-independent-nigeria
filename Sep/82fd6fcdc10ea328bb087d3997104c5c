Chelsea striker Tammy Abraham has expressed his hope that “this can be my season” following his hat-trick in the 5-2 win at Wolves. Abraham’s treble on Saturday saw him surge, with seven goals, to the top of the Premier League scoring charts, where he was subsequently joined by Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero. The 21-year-old, who had gone into the game having netted back-to-back braces in the previous two matches, scored in the 34th minute with a turn and shot, added a 41st-minute header and slotted in his third 10 minutes into the second half. Abraham was quoted on Chelsea’s official website as saying: “I’ve been working hard and hopefully this can be my season. “It’s up to me to keep showing the gaffer (Frank Lampard) in every game and training session that I’m hungry and I want success. “He told me at half-time to stay on and get the hat-trick so I believed and stayed focused. I’ve just got to be ready to take every chance that comes my way with both hands. I’m working hard and I’m just delighted to see that pay off with my goals (on Saturday) as well as the three points.” Abraham was among a trio of young Chelsea academy graduates for whom it was a particularly good day – the others being defender Fikayo Tomori, also 21, and 20-year-old midfielder Mason Mount. Tomori opened the scoring in the 31st minute with a superb strike from around 30 yards – his first Chelsea goal. The hat-trick from Abraham, who won two senior England caps in 2017, then put Chelsea 4-0 up, before he accidentally diverted the ball into his own net with his hand in the 69th minute to make it 4-1.

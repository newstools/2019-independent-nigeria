The Chairman of the Sovereignty and Territorial Integrity Commission of the National Constituent Assembly (ANC), Gerardo Marquez, said that Venezuelaâ€™s military drills are a response to threats from Colombia. In an interview with Venezolana de Television, the official noted that the 2019 Sovereignty and Peace Exercises along the Venezuela-Colombia border are a timely action in light of the preparation of false positives against the country, promoted by the Ivan Duque government and the United States. There are mobilizations of troops and military equipment, it is a maneuver authorized by the head of State and it has consisted of a major deployment in the states of Tachira, Apure and Zulia, after President Nicolas Maduro authorized the orange alert for the National Bolivarian Armed Forces (FANB), Marquez said. Since September 10, thousands of FANB soldiers have been carrying out patrol and reconnaissance operations along the border with Colombian with the objective of defending national sovereignty in light of the escalation of threats and attacks by the neighboring country.

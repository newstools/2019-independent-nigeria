Henrikh Mkhitaryan is unsure what his future will hold at the end of the season. The midfielder joined Roma on a season-long loan from Arsenal last week just days after featuring in the North London derby against Tottenham. The 30-year-old joined the Gunners in January 2018 as part of the swap deal that sent Alexis Sanchez to Manchester United. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Roma reportedly do not have an option to buy the Armenia captain after paying a loan fee of around £2.7million. “Let’s first see what I can do in Roma,” the midfielder told VBET News. “At the end of the season I think we can talk if I will have the possibility to stay or to go to something else, I don’t know. “Now, I cannot say about future, it’s better to be focused on the next games.” Mkhitaryan scored nine goals in 56 appearances since joining Arsenal during the January transfer window in 2018. He now links up with former United team-mate Chris Smalling at Roma, who also joined Roma on loan during the summer. The midfielder was in good form for his country as he scored twice as Armenia won 4-2 against Bosnia in their Euro 2020 qualifier on Sunday.

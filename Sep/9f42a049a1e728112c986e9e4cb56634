ABUJA – The least regarding the ceding of part of Bakassi peninsula to the government of Cameroon may not have been heard, as a concerned group has alleged that genocide is taking place in the region. The Nigerian group, under the aegis of Nigerian Ambazonian Sovereignty Recognition Society, NASORES, which raised the alarm in Abuja on Friday, said President Muhammadu Buhari’s intervention is highly needed at this point in time. National Director of NOSORES, Hon. Cletus Obun said the Nigerian government doesn’t need to stay aloof and watch the alleged genocide in the English speaking part of Cameron which shares boundary with Nigeria. Already about 35,000 people from Southern Cameroon are said to be taking refuge in Cross River State which shares boundary with Cameroon. Obun alleged that Cameroon had been encroaching on the Nigerian territory in Boki axis of Cross River State after taking over Bakassi Peninsula. He said that timely intervention of President Buhari would be of tremendous relieve to Nigeria that is sorrounded by Franco-phone countries. Obun, who was a former member of Cross River State House of Assembly representing Boki State Constituency said, “The targeted aim of shrinking the Nigerian territory is too painful and must not be allowed. “We will not stand aloof and watch people who are much in our image be maltreated, dehumnised and annihilated.” He called on the Federal Government “to campaign for the permanent solution to the problems of the indigenous minority English- speaking peoples of Cameroun by calling for an exclusive referendum on the choices of restoring their independence as Ambazonians or staying as Camerounians. “There is need to campaign for an “international peace-keeping force” to enforce NASORES’ call for an immediate cessation of hostilities between the Cameroun armed forces and the Amba fighters,” he stated.

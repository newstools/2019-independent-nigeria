UGHELLI – Comrade Matthew Azazi, a Foremost Niger Delta Youth Leader and Activist has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to disregard and discountenance calls for the removal of the Special Adviser to the President on Niger Delta and Coordinator of the Presidential Amnesty Programme (PAP), Professor Charles Dokubo, saying the calls are selfish, self centred and does not represent the interest of the ex-militants of Niger Delta at large. Comrade Azazi who spoke to newsmen in Abuja said Prof. Dokubo has successfully redirected the Amnesty programme to its original mandate for sustainable peace, stability and economic development in the Niger Delta, adding that it was not good to change a winning team. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network He said the people and groups spearheading the calls for the removal of Dokubo are mainly fictitious and does not have the blueprint to do better in handling the programme. He stressed that majority of youths, ex-militants and stakeholders of the Niger Delta have implicit confidence in the ability of Professor Dokubo to take PAP to the next level in line with the mantra of the Buhari administration. According to Comrade Azazi, “Prof. Dokubo, a peace and conflict resolution expert through the Amnesty Programme has met the yearnings of youths who are currently undergoing various training exercises under the amnesty programme as he has shown capacity and commitment with the training and retraining of ex-agitators for better empowerment within his first year and few days in office”.

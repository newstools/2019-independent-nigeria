How much money a creator will earn from a single YouTube video varies, but there are some factors that can help boost revenue. Creators become eligible to earn money by placing ads within their videos through YouTube’s Partner Program. These ads are filtered by Google and creators get paid a certain amount based on factors like a video’s watch time, length, and viewer demographic. One YouTube creator told Business Insider that lengthening her videos to over 10 minutes long has helped her channel earn more money because she can place more ads. Other YouTube influencers said that placing about four ads on a single video is a common technique used to maximize the revenue you earn from Google AdSense. Creators on YouTube earn a certain amount of money based on their CPM rate, or cost per 1,000 video views. CPM rates vary between creators, and no creator consistently has the same CPM rate. It can change based on factors like where the viewers of the video are located and what type of advertisers are interested in the content. One YouTuber said that out of her three successful YouTube channels, her one focused on business gets a much higher CPM. “People who watch this content aren’t kids or students,” she said . “They are people who already started their careers and want transition in their career.” Business Insider spoke to YouTube influencers who broke down how much they earned from a video with 100,000 views, 1 million views, and 4 million views.

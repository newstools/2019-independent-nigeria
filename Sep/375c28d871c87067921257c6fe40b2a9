UGHELLI – A group, The Delta Ijaw Political Machineries, has condemned the interference of governors of oil-producing states on the recent appointments of some persons into the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) board by President Muhammadu Buhari. It would be recalled that the governors of the oil-producing states, in a meeting held last Thursday in Abuja, rejected the composition of the board of NDDC and some appointments made into the commission by President Buhari. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network But in reaction to actions of the governors of the oil-producing states, the Delta Ijaw Political Machineries, in a statement signed by its national coordinator, Stanley Garry, said “it was the prerogative of Mr. President to appoint persons of his choice to man positions of authority, federal agencies, parastatals and boards.” The statement reads: “President Buhari has stated it clearly that it’s only the Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs has the controlling authority to supervise the affairs and activities of the NDDC. “So governors of oil-producing states have no powers to nominate persons for Mr. President who has the privilege to do so.” The group expressed total support for the appointment of Pius Odubu and Bernard Okumagba as Chairman and Managing Director of the Niger Delta Development Commission respectively, describing the duo as unassuming, humane technocrats with international repute that will make NDDC achieve its Master plan.

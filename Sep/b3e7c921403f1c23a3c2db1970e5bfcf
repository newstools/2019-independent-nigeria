ABUJA – Dickson Akoh , National Commandant, Peace Corps of Nigeria (PCN), has charged both political and traditional leaders to join hands with government in formulating policies that would engender peace in the country. The commandant gave this charge on Saturday in Abuja during the United Nations International Day of Peace celebration tagged, “Climate Action For Peace.” He said that there can never be peace in the atmosphere of crisis and that Nigerians should be concerned and worried by the alarming rate of disharmony and killings in the society. Akoh said, “It is on this note that we wish to advise our egocentric politicians, ethnic warlords and religion bigots to desist from fanning the embers of war and rather join hands with government in formulating deliberate policies that will engender peace, unity and development in Nigeria.” Akoh called on Nigerians irrespective of political, ethnic, or religious affiliation to embrace peace for a better society. He lamented the inexplicable violent killings in the country and its attendant implications on the progress, growth and development of the country.

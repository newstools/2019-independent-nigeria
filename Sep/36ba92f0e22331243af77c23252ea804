ADO-EKITI – There was anxiety in Ado-Ekiti over the missing of two months old baby. Saturday INDEPENDENT learnt that the baby was declared missing after a certain woman lured the mother of the baby to the secretariat to receive bogus relief materials. The suspect, who was said to be a regular customer of the victim, had deceived the mother of the infant to follow her to the State Secretariat to collect some relief materials being given by government to flood victims. A source said the suspect later sent the mother of the missing baby on an errand to help buy recharge card. The victim woman said to have come from the eastern part of the country had been patronising her at the Oja-Oba market where she sells soup ingredients since Monday on daily basis. She said the woman informed her on Wednesday that she would take her to the State Secretariat where her husband works and that the husband would facilitate her getting those materials. All efforts to get the true identity of the victim mother and the suspect proved abortive as the line of the Ekiti State Public Relations Officer, Caleb Ikechukwu could not be reached. The suspect was said to have a list and that she included her victim’s name making her believe that she was being favoured. The poor woman, who claimed she had lost a child recently before the delivery of the stolen boy, said the suspect collected her phone and the baby and gave her money to buy recharge card quickly so as to make an urgent call and that, by the time she came back, the woman had fled with her baby. The 2 month-old baby boy of 2 months had shaved head.

The UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has welcomed the most comprehensive agreement ever on global health advocating universal coverage by 2030. He described the declaration as a milestone.
‘This agreement reflects a vision for the most comprehensive global health coverage ever ‘moving together for a healthier world’, Guterres told a UN General Assembly meeting in New York.’ ‘Everyone has a right to a quality and affordable healthcare service, he said. Nearly 100 million worldwide suffer from poverty due to catastrophic high cost of healthcare expenses, and weak healthcare systems pose a risk that goes far beyond national borders, the Secretary General said. The agreement comes one after the World Health Organisation and its partners called for the need to double healthcare coverage from now until 2030, warning that about 5 billion humans could become unable to access sufficient care healthcare services.

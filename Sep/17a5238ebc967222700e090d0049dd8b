LAGOS – Sale Mamman, Minister of Power, has reassured Nigerians that the President Muhammadu Buhari administration would deliver uninterrupted power supply when all major power projects were completed before the end of its tenure. The minister stated this after inspection of the 215 MW Kaduna Power Plant, the 132/33KV Kudenda Substation, and the Mando transmission line in Kaduna at the weekend. Mamman, who was in company of the Minister of State, Goddy Jedy Agba, said aside increasing generation capacity, the Kudenda Substation would be providing voltage support to Kaduna, Kano, and Jos, which would improve the quality of electricity distribution. In a statement by Aaron Artimas, his Special Adviser on Communication and Strategy, Mamman, who expressed satisfaction with the level and quality of work done on the projects, warned contractors against any delay in completion of the projects. “We are here to inspect the level of work done on the project and I can tell you that I am very sure Nigerians, particularly those in Kaduna, Kano, Jos and environs would begin to enjoy not only stable but quality power supply when these projects are fully completed and put into use,” he said. He reiterated the commitment of the Buhari-led administration to achieve its mandate of economic growth and development, as well as job creation.

A non-profit organisation, Glorious Vessels Foundation, has called on individuals and organisations to assist the less privileged in the country, as this would help in reducing the suffering the poor and destitute face daily on Nigerian streets. A Coordinator of the foundation, Jasmine Asekome made this last Saturday, when the foundation visited the Agege area of Lagos to distribute food items, water and other items to children and indigent adults in the area. According to Asekome, “We have a burden for the homeless and downtrodden, who on our streets, face hunger and deprivation. This is why we have returned to Lagos six months after our last programme in Iyana-Ipaja, to reach out to the people of Agege. “We know we can’t possibly meet all their needs because we lack the resources but we believe in doing anything we can to put smiles on the faces of people. Whatever we do, no matter how little it may be will certainly go some distance in ameliorating their condition. “We appeal to Nigerians, individuals and organisations of goodwill to join us in this crusade and help transform the lives of the destitute and children on the streets.”

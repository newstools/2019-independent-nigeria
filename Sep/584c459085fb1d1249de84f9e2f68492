Hong Kong’s anti-extradition bill movement will be three months old on September 9. In the past few months, the mass protests in the city have undergone a transformation — from peaceful demonstrations to violent clashes between the protesters and Hong Kong police. Recently, riot police chased and beat up protesters and passengers at the Prince Edward metro station, with eye-witnesses reporting about police brutality, DW reports. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Chi-Fai Ng, the chairperson of Hong Kong’s Chef Union, told DW he was on his way home when his train was canceled and all passengers were asked to leave. “Two minutes after the MTR staff announced the station was closed, the riot police descended on the platform and started chasing protesters in black shirts,” said Ng, adding that the security officials attacked protesters and started hitting them with batons. “The way police used force that night, I was worried that someone would die,” he said. Other passengers spoke about a similar police crackdown. “I saw police pushing a protester toward a wall,” Chan, a passenger, told DW. “Then many police officials jumped on top of him and started hitting his head with batons. I was standing very close to him, and I was afraid that they would beat him to death.”

LAGOS – A group, Centre Against Injustice and Domestic Violence (CAIDOV), has called on the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Adamu, to as a matter of urgency, withdraw all officers attached as escorts to individuals perceived to be VIPs.
CAIDOV made this call while reacting to the killing of a man, Waliu Dauda, by a yet to be identified policeman, who was alleged to have fired some shots into the air, while leading an unnamed dignitary out of a church premise in Ladipo, Oshodi area of the state last Sunday evening.
While calling on the Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Zubairu Muazu, to urgently unmask the trigger-happy policeman, the group in a statement by its Executive Director, Gbenga Soloki, described the incident as unfortunate, “wicked and pure murder”.
Soloki pointed out that unmasking the killer cop will bring succor to the family of the deceased as well serve as deterrent to other “irresponsible policemen”.
The group, while maintaining that the police IG must withdraw his men police attached to some prominent people in the society, equally urged him to conduct a thorough search to ascertain that most of those police escorts are genuine.
According to Soloki, information has it that some of these officers escorting VIPs are dismissed policemen, while some are mere area boys who are equipped by those who they protect.
“We want to appeal to the Police boss to embark on serious scrutiny to unmask those police that murdered that young man in Ladipo Lagos State.
“It is also pertinent to carry out extensive audit of police attached to VIPs as some are either dismissed or retired policemen and in some instances, area boys are well equipped and provided gadgets by their bosses, thus the need to critically examine them and possibly withdraw some since the number of police we have is grossly inadequate for protection,” the statement read in part.
The group, however, commiserated with the family of the deceased, also promising that it will ensure that justice is served in the matter; just as it urged Muazu not to cover up anybody find to be guilty of the murder.

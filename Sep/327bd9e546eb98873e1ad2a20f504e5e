Romelu Lukaku scored in his first Milan derby as Inter beat AC Milan. Marcelo Brozovic gave Antonio Conte’s Inter the lead with a deflected strike, which was confirmed after a VAR review. Former Manchester United forward Lukaku headed home his third goal in four Serie A matches from Nicolo Barella’s cross. Inter hit the woodwork twice late on, through Matteo Politano and Antonio Candreva, with Milan’s Theo Hernandez also striking the post. The result takes Inter – who have won all four of their league games this season so far – back to the top of the table, above champions Juventus, who beat Verona 2-1 earlier on Saturday. Inter last won the Serie A title in 2010 as part of the treble under Jose Mourinho.

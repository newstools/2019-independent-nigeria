Awka – The former Governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Anambra State Hon. Oseloka Henry Obaze has criticized the just introduced cashless policy of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) describing it as discriminatory. Obaze who was a diplomat at the United Nations before he was invited into the Anambra State Government by former Governor Peter Obi said there was no statutory justification for the policy. In a statement addressed to the President Muhammadu Buhari and the National Assembly, Obaze wrote: “The just-announced CBN cashless policy, even with the best of intentions, is discriminatory as it targets selected States- Lagos, Ogun, Kano, Abia, Anambra, Rivers, and FCT – as pilot states, with no obvious statutory justification. “Such a policy, which is punitive to affected states and preferential to unaffected states, undermines the sovereign equality of the 36 States. “It should either be applied uniformly or suspended immediately. As it stands, it is an egregious public policy inimical to business and commercial interests of the affected states”.

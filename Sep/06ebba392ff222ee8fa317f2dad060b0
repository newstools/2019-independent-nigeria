The annual Awa Ibraheem Junior Championship has taken a leap from local to international event as it is now registered with the world golf governing body, Royal and Ancient (R & A) of St. Andrew, Scotland. The R & A recognition implies that the championship, beginning from the 2019 edition is a World Amateur Golf Ranking (WAGR) event and can accommodate international participation. Thus, the criteria for the 2019 participation will be based strictly on the Junior National Order of Merit (OR); hence the best 90 players on the list (spread over the different age categories of 6-17) will be qualified to participate. Emy Ekong, Director of Youth and Women Development, Nigeria Golf Federation (NGF) in a statement said, “The Order of Merit is based on three categories (Under 10-11; 12-17) and this event is for 17 years and under.” According to the to the programme schedule, the event will hold from October 17-19: “In line with the World Ranking event requirement of at least 54-holes or three days.” October 17 will be for arrival and registration; October 18 will be the Day-1 of the competition and October 19 Day-2 of competition and presentation of prizes and awards. Age 12 – 17 years will play 36 holes; 10-11 will play 18 holes and nine years below will play nine holes. But, there will be a cut after the first day of the competition. However, the birth certificate for the authentication of players from age 15-17 would be required on or before September 30 as organisers said, “it is to enable us fix you at the appropriate category.” “While others, should please send us a copy of their birth certificate or proof of age on or before September 30, to enable us fix them at the appropriate category. They can also send it via email,” it said. The event will also serve as one of the National Trials for the All Africa Junior Team Championship holding in Egypt in 2020, just as she also revealed that feeding and accommodation, entry fee will be free.

UYO – A father of 14 children, Mr Godwin Authur Udoh, from Ikot Abasi Ufon village in Mkpat Enin LGA, and Madam Iquo Ubid , a widow with four grandchildren from Nung Ette village in Ibesikpo Asutan, Wednesday received keys to two bedroom bungalow each, courtesy of Family Empowerment and Youth Reorientation Path-initiative (FEYReP). The houses commissioned and handed over by Her Excellency, Mrs. Martha Udom Emmanuel, is part of the activities marking four years of her pet project, FEYReP. Speaking at the respective venues, FEYReP founder, Mrs. Martha Udom Emmanuel, thanked God for the ability to touch lives these past years through her pet project, saying her vision of providing shelter for the indigent members of the society is one of the many avenues aimed at showcasing successful families. She noted that beneficiaries of FEYReP programmes were not only limited to widows and widowers, but cuts across all segments of the society. “I don’t select based on any affiliation; I pick the beneficiaries based on my conviction with the help of the God. I didn’t even know that the beneficiary was a man until I saw the pictures. As you can see, this family has just been blessed and you may be in line next time,” Mrs. Emmanuel said at Mkpat Enin. The governor’s wife advised the beneficiary to engage in family planning so as to curtail the number of children. In Ibesikpo Asutan LGA, Mrs. Emmanuel thanked God for the life of the widow and her grandchildren, stating that she got to know of her precarious condition during one of the empowerment programmes of the governor. She encouraged the widow to get closer to God and trust in His word to deliver her from every adversary.

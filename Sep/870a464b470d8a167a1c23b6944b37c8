Sheffield United won away for the first time on their return to the Premier League as a Yerry Mina own goal and a late Lys Mousset strike condemned Everton to defeat at Goodison Park. The Toffees had won their first two games on home soil this season and dominated for large periods of this game as they looked to bounce back from defeat at Bournemouth last time out. However, they fell behind five minutes before the break when a ball from an Oliver Norwood corner deflected off Mina to land in the back of the net. The Blades withstood huge pressure as the home side looked to rescue something from the game and, although Bernard had a penalty appeal waved away, Everton struggled to find a way through a resolute defence. Chris Wilderâ€™s side made certain of a superb away victory when substitute Mousset raced through before calmly slotting beyond Jordan Pickford for his first Sheffield United goal. The win means Sheffield United move up to eighth with eight points, four clear of the relegation zone. Everton, who were booed at the final whistle, are 14th with six points. Sheffield United made a strong start to life back in the Premier League, with four points from their first two games. But home defeats to Leicester and Southampton suggested the early momentum was on the wane.

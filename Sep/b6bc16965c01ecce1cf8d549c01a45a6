Uyo – The National Assembly election petitions tribunal sitting in Uyo has upheld the victory of Christopher Ekpenyong who represents Ikot Ekpene Senatorial District of Akwa Ibom State at the senate. The three-man panel in a marathon judgement handed down by its chairman, Justice W. O. Akanbi, at about 11.17 pm of Wednesday, September 11, ruled that Ekpenyong, a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), was duly elected by majority votes cast during the February 23, 2019, senatorial election. One out of the three judges, however, ruled contrary to his two colleagues in the panel and therefore called for Akpabio to be declared a winner. The panel through a majority decision dismissed the petition filed by Senator Godswill Akpabio of the All Progressives Congress (APC), challenging the declaration of Ekpenyong by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as the winner of the said election. The panel described the petition as “lacking merit”, and noted that the petitioner failed to prove that he won the said election as well as failed to present convincing evidence of noncompliance to Electoral Act as raised in his petition. It could be recalled that the February 23 election result for the Ikot Ekpene Senatorial District between  Godswill Akpabio of the All Progressives Congress and Chris Ekpenyong of the Peoples Democratic Party was delivered by INEC at midnight, after days of suspense and tension in the state.

In the dusty village where Zimbabwe’s founding father Robert Mugabe grew up, family members speak of the deep bitterness Mugabe felt from his ousting as head of state two years ago until his death in Singapore on Friday. Mugabe, who died aged 95, was a totemic figure for his role in the struggle against white minority rule, leading Zimbabwe from independence in 1980 until he was toppled by his own army in November 2017, Reuters reports. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network He was feted in the early years of his rule but his reputation was later severely tarnished by his disastrous handling of one of Africa’s most promising economies and by a series of brutal crackdowns on opponents. For relatives such as Leo Mugabe, the former president’s nephew, the manner in which he was removed from power by the army and replaced by his former deputy Emmerson Mnangagwa left a sour taste. “He was bitter. You can imagine, the people that you trusted, the people who were guarding you, the people that were looking after your security are the same people that turn against you,” he told reporters outside Mugabe’s homestead in Kutama village, 85 km (52.8 miles) from the capital Harare along the Robert Mugabe Highway.

LAGOS – Ahead of next weekend’s decisive CAF Champions League preliminary match between Enyimba and Al Hilal at the Omdurman Stadium in Sudan, Enyimba’s Standley Okorom, has sounded very confident, saying that it would be total war in Sudan. Okorom, in a chat with DAILY INDEPENDENT, spoke on the backdrop of their unimpressive goalless game in Aba penultimate Sunday for a result that has posed a threat to their continued stay in the foremost continental competition. Okorom said that they’ve been pushed to the wall and that they had no option than to defeat their hosts and qualify for the group stage, assuring their fans that Enyimba would bring their huge experience to bear in the game. “It will be total war in Sudan because our back is now on the wall; it is going to be a fight to finish because that is the only option left for us right now. We are going to defeat them and I want to assure our fans that we are Enyimba and we fear them not,” he said.

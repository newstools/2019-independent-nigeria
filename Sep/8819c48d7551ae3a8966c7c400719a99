Abuja – Atiku Abubakar, candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the February 23, 2019 presidential election, said he appealed the judgment of the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal (PEPT) because of grave legal errors committed by the five-man panel led by Justice Mohammed Garba. The appeal was filed on Monday, September 23, 2019 based on 66 grounds.
The PEPT, which sat at the Court of Appeal Abuja Division, on Wednesday, September 11, upheld the election of President Muhammadu Buhari as winner of the 2019 presidential election.
At the apex court, Atiku is praying for an order to allow the appeal as validly constituted.
The appellant is also asking the Supreme Court to set aside the judgment of the Presidential Election Petition Court delivered on September 11, 2019.
In addition, Atiku wants an order granting reliefs a, b, c, d, and e at paragraph 409 of the petition of the appellants.
Alternatively to relief C above, Atiku is asking for an order or declaration that the election to the office of the President of Nigeria held or conducted by the 1st respondent on February 23, 2019 be nullified and a fresh election ordered.
In ground one of the appeal, Atiku argued that the tribunal erred in law.
“The learned justices of the Court of Appeal erred in law when they relied on ‘overall interest of justice’ to hold that the 2nd respondent’s exhibits R1 to R26, P85 and P86 were properly admitted in evidence,” Atiku stated.
In the particulars of error, the appellant said exhibits R1 to R26, P85 and P86 were not pleaded by the 2nd respondent.
He said: “Exhibits R1 to R26, P85 and P86 were not frontloaded.
“No leave of court was sought pursuant to paragraph 41 (8) of the 1st Schedule to the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended) to receive Exhibits R1 to R26, P85 and P86 in evidence.
“Exhibits P85 and P86 were tendered through PW40 who is not the maker and there is no nexus between him and the documents.
“Exhibits R1 to R26, P85 and P86 were held to have been properly admitted in evidence based on a blanket statement.”
In ground two, Atiku submitted that the learned justices of the Court of Appeal erred in law when they held thus: “My firm view is that section 76 of the Electoral Act is clearly inapplicable to the issues under consideration.
“More importantly, the law is firmly settled that a candidate is not required by the constitution or the Electoral Act to attach his certificates to FORM CF001 before the candidate can be considered or adjudged to have the requisite educational qualifications to contest election.”
Atiku held that the court below gave restrictive interpretation to section 76 of the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended) in order to exclude Form CF001 from its provisions.
It was the appellant’s contention that the conduct of election by the 1st respondent starts with the screening of candidates.
“No candidate can be screened unless he completes Form CF001 (Exhibit P1),” Atiku posited.
“In Form CF001, under the column for ‘schools attended/educational qualification with dates”, there is the clear provision: “Attach evidence of all educational qualifications.
“Certificates are evidence of educational qualifications,” he said.

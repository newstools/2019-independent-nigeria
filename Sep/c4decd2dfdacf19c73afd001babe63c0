The Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi, has refuted claims that he attended the World Economic Forum (WEF), in South Africa.
Fayemi had been heavily criticised for attending the forum in the wake of the xenophobic attacks on Nigerians and other foreign nationals based in South Africa.
A statement by Olayinka Oyebode, the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor of Ekiti State, stated that the claims by online reports were misleading.
The statement read: “Contrary to some misleading online reports, Ekiti State Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi was not at the World Economic Forum in South Africa.”
It further clarified the purpose for which Fayemi had visited the country stating that “the Governor is in South Africa to honour an invitation by a long-time friend and one of Nigeria’s most celebrated journalists, Mr. Dele Olojode at the ‘Africa in the World Festival of Ideas’ which held in Stellensbosch far away from Cape Town.”
According to Oyebode, the event which Fayemi went for had already held before the decision of the Federal Government to boycott the WEF programme.

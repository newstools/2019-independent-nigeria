ADO- EKITI – Stakeholders in Ekiti South Senatorial District have held meetings over the outcome of the Election Petition Tribunal, which nullified the election of Senator Dayo Adeyeye and declared Abiodun Olujimi the winner of the poll. The stakeholders, who spoke at separate meetings held at major towns of Omuo, Ikere, Emure and other towns in the district, flayed the tribunal verdict. The leaders, who are members of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), described the judgment as strange and did not reflect the wishes of people in the senatorial district. Chairman of APC in the Senatorial district, Akin Akinbobola, said the judgement amounts to truncating the desire of the people as demonstrated during the general election in March. “We are surprised by the outcome of the tribunal; we reject it and it will not stand a test of time. It is just a ploy to raise unnecessary dust in the area, but we are not bothered,” he added. A youth leader in Omuo, Gbade Olusegun, pointed out that the emergence of Adeyeye at the March election was transparent and followed due process. Saying it was unfortunate that the tribunal acted contrary to the wishes of the people, he assured that the celebration by the opposition members would be short lived. “Yes, the tribunal has delivered its verdict, which is more or less, a joy that will soon be truncated, Senator Adeyeye is a man of the people anytime, any day; we will soon take back the victory,” he added. Speaking in Ikere, a woman leader of APC, Rachael Ibukun expressed the hope that the Court of Appeal will redress the jungle Justice handed down by the tribunal. Mrs Ibukun also has a word of advice to opposition members in Ekiti South senatorial district saying they should not roll out the drums yet. “The judgment was strange and cannot stand the test of time. The judiciary is supposed to be the last bastion of the common man and we are confident that what the opposition have now, is pyrrhic victory”, she explained.

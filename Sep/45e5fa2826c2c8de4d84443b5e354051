ABUJA – National Chairman of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), Ralphs Nwosu, has condemned the abduction of the National Chairman of the Action Alliance Party (AA), Chief Kenneth Udeze.
Reacting to the news of Nwosu’s abduction on Saturday in Abuja, Nwosu described the abduction as “unacceptable and another acts of threat to the security of the lives of the average Nigerian and the nation’s democracy.
“The news of the kidnap came to me as a surprise. It goes to show that the political leadership in place leaves much to be desired. I am aware that he is having issues with the former governor of Imo state, Senator Rochas Okorocha and his son-in-law, Uche Nwosu. Udeze’s abduction also shows that the political actors have turned the whole thing into an act of gangerstism.
“This incident happened in Abuja for that matter and not on any of the nation’s highways. So the question to ask now is: do we have a government in place? We can’t have economic development if we continue in this manner.
“These are the issues former President Olusegun Obasanjo said President Buhari should address. Not long ago, former president Obasanjo called for a national summit on security. That summit is long overdue. So lam highly bewildered at the whole situation,” he said.
He, however, called on the Inspector General of Police and other relevant security agencies to move quickly and ensure Udenze’s rescue from his abductors before it is too late.
Udeze was reportedly kidnapped on Friday by unknown gunmen in front of the Dutse branch of Zenith Bank in Abuja.
According to his wife, Genevieve, his assailants took him away in a black SUV vehicle.
Udeze who was said to have received text messages indicating that several heavy unauthorised withdrawals were being made in his bank account, rushed to the bank to find out the circumstances of the alleged illegal withdrawal, only to be abducted in front of the Zenith Bank office.

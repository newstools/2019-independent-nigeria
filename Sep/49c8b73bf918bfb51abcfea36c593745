KATSINA – To avoid the abuse of the emergency communication service, the Federal Government has been urged to introduce severe punishment for service providers that fail to block unregistered lines. Governor Aminu Bello Masari made the appeal on Monday in Katsina at the launching of the National Emergency Toll Free Number, 112 and commissioning of State Emergency Communication Centre. Masari, represented by his deputy, Alhaji Mannir Yakubu, pledged to enlighten and educate the citizens of the state on the importance of the toll free number and how to use it. “We are aware of your recent directives to all service providers in the country to disconnect all unregistered lined. This will provide solution to the issue of kidnapping where such lines are used to contact families of the victims without any trace of their identity,” he said. He noted that the state government, with the support of the Federal Government, had done a lot to check insecurity in the state. Dr. Ali Isa Pantami, Minister of Communication, earlier said the Federal Government was calling on the state governments to join hands with it in the area of ICT. He noted that the emergency number was introduced to assist in saving peoples’ lives and property, adding that even in advanced world they have such numbers for emergencies.

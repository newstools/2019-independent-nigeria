UGHELLI – Lucky Egboyi, a Warri based lawyer, on Sunday, lambasted President Muhammadu Buhari on the appointment of Godswill Akpabio and Festus Keyamo as Ministers of Niger Delta Affairs. Egboyi said with the appointments of the duo, the president’s fight against corruption is mere witch-hunting of political enemies. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The legal practitioner, who made the assertion in a chat with journalists in Warri, Warri South Local Government Area of Delta State, said President Buhari made the appointments without taking into consideration ‘morality’. “The president has the right to exercise his prerogative powers judicially and judiciously. But he did it without taking into consideration morality,” he added. Egboyi recalled that President Buhari, acclaimed to be a man of integrity, was voted in by Nigerians who dreamt of him being their ‘Messiah’ at a time when they felt former President Goodluck Jonathan failed them. He described the appointment of Godswill Akpabio as Minister of Niger Delta Affairs as a ‘political patronage’ for him to recoup all he has lost. “This is a man when he was in PDP was a regular guest at the EFCC. For Keyamo, who was prosecuting Akpabio, to be junior minister is something else. The corruption fight is a charm.” He said: “Nigerians are hopeless and no one is protesting. He has made the appointment and nobody can question him. Evans can even be brought from prison and be given appointment. But he should do it with human face.”

The President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan said on Friday that the National Assembly is eager to receive the 2020 budget proposals. “We are hopeful and optimistic, as well as hungry and thirsty, to receive the 2020 appropriations bill,” Lawan told reporters shortly on his arrival from a private visit abroad. Lawan seized the advantage of the National Assembly current recess to travel on a private visit to Morocco and Germany. “I am aware that the executive arm of government is working assiduously to ensure that the appropriation bill for the year 2020 is presented to the National Assembly by the end of this month. “The National Assembly will work so hard to ensure that the 2020 budget is passed before we go on Christmas break,” Lawan said. The Senate President said budget is one issue that the National Assembly will take head-on to ensure that the undesirable trend of the budget is reversed. Lawan also disclosed that the executive has forwarded to the Senate the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) which will be considered when the Senate is back from its recess next week. “We hope to take on the MTEF within the first legislative week. Our committee on Finance will be saddled with its first major responsibility that it works expeditiously on the Fiscal Strategy Paper/Medium Term Expenditure Framework’s request of the executive arm of government and thereafter the budget will come after that.” The Senate President said the ninth National Assembly would work assiduously with the executive arm of government to improve the security situation of the country. The Senate, he added, will also evaluate the crisis that affected Nigerians living in South Africa.

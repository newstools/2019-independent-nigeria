OWERRI – Most Rev. Dr. Solomon Amatu, the Catholic Bishop of Okigwe Diocese in Imo State, has warned officials of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to apply utmost sincerity, uprightness and patriotism in their onslaught against corrupt public office holders. According to him, for the anti-graft agency to triumph in its crusade against graft and financial improperly by those entrusted with positions of authority and influence, it must purge themselves of the cancer of sentiments and selective devices and should honour those who served meritoriously before leaving office.

For now, there appears to be a selective approach in the system and it does not augur well for us.” The Bishop extolled High Chief Richard Egbule as an ideal patriot who served the nation meritoriously without blemish and enjoined public office holders to emulate him.

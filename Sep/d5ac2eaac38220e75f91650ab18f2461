Manchester United could be without five key players for the Premier League visit of Leicester City this weekend. The injured Manchester United stars were among those to arrive for training on Wednesday as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer prepares his team for their Premier League encounter with Leicester. The Red Devils manager is sweating on the fitness of five key players ahead of their Old Trafford showdown with the high-flying Foxes. Defensive duo Luke Shaw and Aaron Wan-Bissaka, midfielders Jesse Lingard and Paul Pogba and striker Anthony Martial were all forced to miss their national side’s games over the break. Despite the uncertainty over their fitness, Lingard and Martial checked in at the club’s Carrington training base as they continue to step up their return to action. Also seen arriving was Daniel James, who will be full of confidence following his stunning goal in Wales’ 1-0 victory over Belarus on Monday night. And Solskjaer will be hoping to have James in fine form, with the United manager likely to be forced to leave several injured first-team players out of his squad. Shaw missed out on selection for the Euro 2020 qualifiers against Bulgaria and Kosovo due to a hamstring injury picked up against Crystal Palace and subsequently missed the draw with Southampton. Wan-Bissaka and Lingard both withdrew from international duty with England last week, the former with a back injury, the latter due to illness. French duo Pogba and Martial also missed international duty this week; Pogba picked up an ankle injury against the Saints at St. Mary’s which forced him out of France contention. Martial picked up a knock in the home defeat to Palace two weeks ago and was not a part of the matchday squad against the Saints last week.

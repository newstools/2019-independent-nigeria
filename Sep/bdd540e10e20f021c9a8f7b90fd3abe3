JOS – The election petition tribunal sitting in Jos, Plateau State, has struck out the petition filed by the candidate of the United Progressive Party (UPP), Sanusi Moh’d Inuwa, challenging the election of Senator Istifanus Dung Gyang of the People Democratic Party PDP for Plateau North senatorial seat. Delivering judgement, chairman of the tribunal, Justice Theophilus N. Nzeogwu, held that the petition could not be sustained and thus struck it out on that ground that the petitioner woefully failed to prove his case. “The petitioner failed to prove his petition because he did not tender any document to show that he was indeed validly nominated to contest for the Plateau North Senatorial Distric.” UPP had earlier informed the tribunal that Inuwa was nominated for Plateau South Senatorial District and not Plateau North Senatorial District as claimed by the candidate. The national secretary of the UPP appeared at the tribunal where he testified that the party sponsored the petitioner for Plateau South and not Plateau North as seen in the certified true copy of the form UPP submitted to INEC. The tribunal, however, proceeded to dismiss the petition of Inuwa, saying that the petitioner woefully failed to prove his case. In his response, the defence counsel, Barrister Niri Darong, said it was a welcome development, noting that they have proved that the petitioner has no case against his client. The petitioner’s counsel, Barrister George O. Izere, said the beauty of the matter was that the petitioner ventilated his grievances and the court has decided. On whether the petitioner would appeal the judgement, Izere said: “my client would decide that.” Senator Gyang, who is the Deputy Chairman, Senate Committee on Defence, while reacting to the judgement, said he owed his victory to God, while dedicating it to the people who, he said, were the owners of the mandate.

Oil workers under the aegis of NUPENGASSAN yesterday cautioned the Federal Government to take decisive actions to tackling the growing high insecurity situation in the country, noting that the unions are greatly disturbed about the negative impact on the country’s image. NUPENGASSAN in a joint conference organised by Comrade Ndukaku Michael Ohaeri, president the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN), and Comrade Williams Akporeha, the president of Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) respectively, the unions leaders described as unfortunate the unprecedented loss of faith and confidence in the Federal Government security apparatus by Nigerians, thus, giving room for calls for alternative lines of action that may result to state of anarchy.

Every daily headline, locally and globally, is replete with gory stories of killings, kidnapping, ritualism, cultism, human trafficking, rape and all sorts. “We are deeply dumbfounded by the boldness and brazen manner that these bandits carry out their nefarious activities ranging from intimidation, bombings, suicide attacks, killing of security agents, unarmed innocent people, burning of Police stations, kidnapping, raping of school girls and women to mention a but a few”. The union leaders also accused some politicians and political office holders of contributing to the security challenge because of their desperate bid for power which have given rise to the proliferation of guns and creation of armed thugs across the land. The oil and gas workers’ leaders noted that the security challenge has put the lives of members of the unions in jeopardy. “NUPENGASSAN hereby draws the attention of the top echelon of the security agencies to the rot in their respective organisations and implore them to address the issue by smoking out the bad eggs within their folds for the sake of national interest. “We should have security agencies that the people can trust to offer useful intelligence reports and our security officers should be properly trained, equipped and motivated enough to act on such information to smash these criminal gangs before they strike. “NUPENGASSAN however, commended the patriotism, dedication, commitment and resilience of some of the security operatives in the Military, Department of State Services (DSS), Police, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Immigration, Customs so far, in making effort to curtail the upsurge and onslaught of Boko Haram insurgency, banditry, militancy, kidnapping as well as activities of separatists and armed militias, among others in the land. “For us as concerned relevant stakeholders, it has become necessary and expedient at a time like this to urgently alert the Federal Government of the grave dangers that the current situation is posing on the image of our country and the multiplying impacts on the livelihood of the citizenry; we therefore use this medium to make a clarion call on the government and those saddled with the responsibility of securing lives and properties to rise to the occasion by stemming the tide of insecurity and other emerging crimes in order to protect and stabilize our overall socio-economic and political interests”, the labour leaders said.

NNEWI – The Anambra State chapter of Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has appealed to Nigerians to remain calm over the judgment delivered by the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal, noting that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) reserves the right to challenge the judgment at the Supreme Court. This is just as a Pentecostal Bishop and one time chairman of the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN), Onitsha North chapter, Dr. Charles Ekeke described the judgment by the tribunal as a sham. Speaking to newsmen in Onitsha, chairman of Anambra chapter of CAN, Rev. Dr. John Ndubuisi noted that the Christian body as an apex religious body who is not supposed to be partisan, will not say anything on the judgment but will rather leave it to the conscience of Nigeria judiciary. He explained that if after searching their conscience and concluded that the verdict was a just one, “to God be the glory”, he said, just as he appealed to Nigerians to remain peaceful and allow the due process of the law to prevail. He also advised the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and other concerned stakeholders to pool necessary resources together to devise a suitable way to conduct free and credible future elections devoid of rancour in the country. Ekeke on his part noted that all the judges in the tribunal left the main issue in the matter to adjudicate on frivolous issues, adding that the whole content of the judgment was a mockery of the country’s judicial system. He maintained that the judgment was a setback to the growth of Nigeria judiciary just as he advised PDP not to waste their time by going to the supreme, noting that he foresees the same outcome at the apex court.

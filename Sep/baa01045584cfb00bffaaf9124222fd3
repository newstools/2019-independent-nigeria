AWKA – The clamour for Anambra State to retain rotation of the highest office in the state, the governorship seat, is growing as another group, Movement For Greater Anambra State (MOFGAS) throws its support behind the call. The first group to begin the
agitation as Governor Willie Obiano’s tenure is gradually coming to the end was Greater Anambra Forum (GAFORUM). MOFGAS, a non-political pressure group, met in Awka and resolved not only to support rotation of the governorship seat but to campaign for citizens of the state to accept it. It will be recalled that MOFGAS played a leading role in shaping the political environment of the present
political arrangement. Its chairman and chief campaigner, Chief Shadrack Anakwue who also championed Olu N’Adagbe, a pressure group that mobilised Anambra people and led the emergence of Chief Willie Obiano from Anambra North senatorial district emphasized that MOFGAS remains a pressure group. Anakwue told Daily Independent, “We are a pressure group, not a political party.
“We are in support of Anambra South producing the next governorship candidate to respect the zoning system. He submits, “We advise all the political parties to pick their candidates from Anambra South”. Anakwue reiterated that zoning started in the state in 2002 when Dr Chris Ngige and then Peter Obi assumed office after Dr Chinwoke Mbadinuju who was from Anambra South.

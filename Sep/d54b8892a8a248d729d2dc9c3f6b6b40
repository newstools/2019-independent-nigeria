Former Nigeria coach and player, Samson Siasia has said he is still in the dark as to the whereabouts of his abducted mother. Mrs. Ogere Siasia, 76, and two others have been held captive since they were seized in Bayelsa, southern Nigeria 10 weeks ago. But Siasia said the police are no closer to finding her. “The police said it’s been difficult to track these kidnappers, but my great concern is that my mother is very sick,” Siasia told BBC Sport. “For someone who is unwell to be held against her will is not only callous, but heartbreaking and sad. “So I can only keep appealing to these guys to please let my mother go. I would like for the government or whoever is capable to help me bring my mother back.” It’s the second time in four years that Mrs. Siasia has been kidnapped after she was held by gunmen for 12 days, before her release back in November 2015.

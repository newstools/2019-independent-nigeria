Inter Milan spoke to Italian media outlet InterTV following the Nerazzurri’s 1-0 victory over Udinese in the Serie A at home at the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza at the weekend. He singled out praises for Romelu Lukaku, his newly signed star from Manchester United for his sacrifices even when his fitness was in doubt. “I was aware of the difficulties of the game. Udinese are a physical team with strong players, good at restarts. We’ve had a lot of difficulties in the one-on-one game, but we’ve faced this challenge in the right way and with the right attitude. “We worked on an alternative to our 3-5-2 and I’m happy because having an alternative to a game system is very important. Even during the game, you can become much more offensive with three pure strikers. “Today we played with two trequartisti, Politano and Sensi. The team is storing knowledge, enriching and expanding their football brains. This is very important, I’m happy.” The coach then spoke of his players and their performance in the victory. “Romelu had a problem during the warm-up in his back. So, first of all, I’d like to thank him because he played and gave everything he had.

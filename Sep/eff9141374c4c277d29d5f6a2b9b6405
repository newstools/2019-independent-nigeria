LAGOS – Wilfred Ndidi, Leicester City midfielder, has parried any thought about disloyalty on his part towards the Super Eagles, as he said he had to opt out of last week’s international friendly against Ukraine on account of his ongoing recovery from some fitness issues. Although many Nigerians are of the views that Ndidi was economical with the truth, as he went on to play two straight matches for his club after being replaced in the Super Eagles’ squad for the tie that ended in a pulsating 2-2 draw in Dnipro, the player disclosed that he was not fully fit to face a long distance trip and extra training. The former Racing Genk of Belgium youngster admitted that his absence from the Eagles’ squad for the game came unexpectedly, as he had earlier being included in the list of invitees, but said he earlier discussed the situation with the coach, Gernot Rohr, which had also been hinted by Leicester’s gaffer, Brendan Rodgers, and they all reached an understanding over the matter. “The reason why I didn’t go for the national team camp is that I’m still recovering from my strain, and my club is still monitoring my situation. I spoke to the manager, and he agreed with me. “I’m still committed to the national team and I still love playing for Nigeria. I am dedicated as ever, I’ve always loved playing football since I was a kid, and I remain ready to make my country proud by honouring the call anytime I am invited”, he said. He promised that he will make up for lost time in the Nigerian team, with a pledge that he remains as committed as ever to the nation’s cause and always ready to honour the call whenever it is possible, if he is fit and in shape.

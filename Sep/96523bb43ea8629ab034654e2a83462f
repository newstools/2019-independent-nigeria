Prices of Wheat which had steadily been on the high side have eventually come down to the surprise of consumers. The reduction is good news especially to lovers of the commodity who prefer to prepare it themselves, rather than patronising the packaged one, which seemed to be more expensive because of the processes involved in the production. The commodity is a staple food commonly food on the menu of Nigeria homes and appeared to be mostly consumed by diabetic patients because of its low sugar content. Awareness level of the health benefits associated with the consumption of wheat seemed to be at an appreciable level as some consumers regardless of their age or health status now buy the commodity either as a grain and blend it or buy the packaged one. That of millet which is also staple food but mostly consumed by children and the elderly because of its nutritional value also witnessed a sharp drop in the week under review. Millet could be taken as a pap or solid depending on the choice of the consumer. Visits to various markets across the state by the Business and Market Intelligence Unit of SUNDAY INDEPENDENT revealed that prices of a 100kg bag of wheat and millet fell by over 20 and 15 per cent in some markets from February to September 19, 2019. Reasons predominantly mentioned for the drop were poor patronage owing to lack of money and onset of their season of plenty. At the Ogbeogologo Market, Asaba, prices of wheat and millet were at a sliding trend especially with prices of a 100kg bag of wheat previously sold for between N24,000 and N25,000 reduced, currently ranging from N19,500 to N20,000 depending on the haggling power of the buyer. Likewise, that of a 100kg bag of millet, declining by 16 percent to N16,000 from N19,000 earlier sold. Mr. Francais Egbuna, who deals in all kinds of grains at the Ogbeogologo Market, Asaba said the drop was a good omen, connecting it to poor sales arising from lack of money. That of Ose Market, Onitsha, was also not different  as prices of a 100kg bag of wheat that previously went for as high as between N23,000 and N23,500 fell within the region of  N18,500 and N19,000 of which many  traders attributed to seasonal factors and low patronage due to lack of purchasing power. Similarly, that of a bag of millet, are currently ranging from N15,500  to N16,00 as against  N18,000 initially sold. Visit to Umuahia Main Market, Abia State, revealed that prices of a 100kg bag of wheat formerly sold for N25,000, during the week, decreased  to N20,000 while that of millet dwindled  to N16,000 from N18,000 previously sold. Mrs. Umanah Joyce, who trades in the commodity at the Umuahia Main Market, Abia State, in a chat with our correspondent, said improved supply was responsible for the drop. In Wuse Market, Abuja, prices of a 100kg bag of wheat, which previously attracted between N18,500 and N19,500 declined, currently selling for between N15,000 and N15,300 while that of millet also dropped to N13,000 from N16,000 earlier sold. A man who sells grains at the Wuse Market, Abuja, but identified himself as Mallam Zubair, linked the situation to increased supply arising from off-season effect. For Achau Market, Kaduna, a 100kg bag of wheat reduced to N16,000 from N18,500 previously sold while that of millet currently goes for between N10,500 and N11,200  down from 13,000 previously sold. Many of the traders connected the situation to low sales due to lack of purchasing power. Checks at the Lafenwa Market, Ogun State, indicated that prices of a bag of wheat were at a downward trend, especially when compared with they were initially sold. For example, a 100kg bag of wheat that previously went for as high as N23,000 declined  during the week to  between 18,700 to 19,200.  Likewise, that of millet, decreased to N13,000 from N15,500 it initially attracted. A man who identified himself as Ganiu, but trades in all kinds of grains at the Lafenwa Market, Ogun State, connected the fall to improved availability usually common with seasonal factors. He was, however, very optimistic that prices of the commodities would crash further since farmers were still harvesting. The same could be said for that of  Bodija Market, especially with the  prices of a 100kg bag of wheat declining to between N17,500 and N18,700 from N20,000 previously sold. While that of a bag of millet also witnessed a downward trend of over 15 percent, currently going for between 13,500 and N14,000 from N16,500 earlier sold. A large proportion of the traders ascribed the decline to improved supply; a situation which they claimed had enabled some of them to maintain their normal purchases. In Lagos, a visit to popular markets such as Iddo, Mile 12 and Daleko, where the commodities are sold in wholesale prices revealed that supply had actually improved as nearly all the shops had the commodities well displayed and traders beckoning on traders for patronage.  The situation, however, had a positive effect on their prices. For example, prices of a 100kg bag of wheat that had been on steady rise for some time, fell sharply to between N17,000 to N17,500 from N22,000 earlier sold. Also, that of a bag of millet, which currently go for between N14,000 and N14,500 down from N16,000 formerly sold. Mrs. Shadiat Dawud, who sells all kinds of grains at the Mile 12 Market, Lagos, told our correspondent that increased supply and low sales were responsible for the drop. The decline in the prices of both commodities also reflected in the purchasing power of those consumers, who buy in smaller measures. For instance, prices of a paint bucket measurement of wheat and millet currently sell for N700 and N800 respectively as against N900 and N1,000 sold before.

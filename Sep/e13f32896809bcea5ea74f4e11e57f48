US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he will name hostage negotiator Robert O’Brien as the new White House national security adviser. O’Brien, who currently serves as the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs at the State Department, has a long history in Republican foreign policy circles. He will be the fourth national security adviser, replacing John Bolton, the hawkish national security adviser Trump forced out last week. Trump said he and Bolton “strongly disagreed” on a number of issues. “I have worked long and hard with Robert,” Trump tweeted in his announcement of the replacement. “He will do a great job!”

Governor Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa State has congratulated President Muhammad Buhari on his victory at the Presidential Election Tribunal, describing the verdict as a victory against falsehood. This was contained in a statement issued on Thursday in Lafia by Mr Yakubu Lamai, the governor’s Director-General, Strategic Communication and Press Affairs. Sule hailed the judgement of the tribunal, stressing that it affirmed that Nigerians voted Buhari for a second term in office as against any false perception. The governor maintained that the verdict of the tribunal reaffirmed that “truth will always triumph over falsehood”. Sule said the judgment affirmed that the electorate in Nasarawa State stood with Buhari because of his “hard earned integrity, which Nigerians will always support and protect”. According to Sule, the verdict has affirmed that Buhari was not only qualified but that he also won the 2019 presidential election and scored the majority lawful votes cast. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, had dragged Buhari to court on the grounds that the election was marred by irregularities and substantial non-compliance with the provisions of the Electoral Act 2010 as amended.

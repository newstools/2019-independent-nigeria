Kogi State Commissioner for the Environment and Natural Resources, Sanusi Yahaya, had said that over 150 communities have been submerged following flood in nine Local Government Areas (LGAs) of the State. Yahaya who disclosed this while addressing newsmen after a stakeholders meeting at the State Emergency Operation Centre on Saturday, in Lokoja, noted that the centre had been activated to address the emergency situation created by the flood. He also said that out of the nine local government areas located along the banks of River Niger and Benue, seven LGAs were severely affected while other two were not so severe. He listed the LGAs severely affected to include: Ibaji, Kogi Koton Karfe, Lokoja, Ofu, Ajaokuta, Omala and Idah, saying over 90 per cent of Ibaji communities have been submerged. “Particularly, majority of communities at Ibaji are under water and many households have been affected and displaced. ”As we speak, the water level has risen very high to about 10.60m on Saturday in Lokoja from the report of the Nigerian Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA). “In the last few days, many communities, settlements have been displaced as a result of flooding,” he said. He said that over 20 camps had been opened by the government to accommodate flood victims, which were spread across the nine affected LGAs. Yahaya, however, advised residents of flood-prone areas and affected communities to relocate to safer places or move to the nearest camps opened by the state and local governments, to avoid loss of lives and property.

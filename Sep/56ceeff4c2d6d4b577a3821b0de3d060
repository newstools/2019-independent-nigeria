AWKA – Ndubuisi Nwobu, the Anambra State chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has said that the manner the presidential election petition tribunal judgement was delivered suggested that the judgment was written outside the court. Nwobu, reacting to Wednesday’s outcome of the petition filled by his party’s presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, accused the judges of pandering to the dictates of President Muhammadu Buhari and helping him to make his case. He said: “The learned judges descended into the arena and were blowing hot and cold at the same time. They were busy dismissing evidence that was given by the petitioner and at the same time admitting the one they were given by the respondents as correct. “It shows that the judgment was being given outside the tribunal, something they have made up their mind to do. “They were looking for lapses here and there. What it means is that tomorrow if I stand for election and claim that I have a PhD whether I have a certificate or not does not matter. It is not good for the judiciary.” Nwobu said that PDP would challenge the judgment at the Supreme Court. However, the state publicity secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Okelo Madukaife, praised the judgment, saying that members of the tribunal broke the judgment down to the understanding of a layman.

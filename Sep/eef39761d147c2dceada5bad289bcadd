Leicester City of England midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi has served up a strong hint that he missed not being part of the team for two straight matches, as he declared how much he is ‘in love’ with other players in the squad, and he was happy to be back in action on Saturday. Following his return to the starting 11 for Saturday’s home victory over AFC Bournemouth, the former racing Genk of Belgium star confessed that it was really satisfying for him to once again line out for The Foxes, especially as his efforts helped his side win the game. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Two goals by Jamie Vardy and one from Youri Tielemans gave Leicester their second victory in four English Premier League (EPL) matches this season, thereby leaving Ndidi ecstatic, after he returned to The Foxes’ starting lineup for the first time since their 1-1 draw against Chelsea. Ndidi was happy to be back in action, having missed the last two games in all competitions due to a hamstring problem, but fellow-Super Eagles’ star, Kelechi Iheanacho was dressed for the encounter, in which Callum Wilson scored a consolation goal for the visitors. The Cherries’ Nigerian-born summer signing, Philip Anyanwu Billing started his fourth straight game in the EPL, while Jordon Ibe and Dominic Solanke were introduced off the bench 18 minutes into the second half, but Nnamdi Ofoborh was omitted from the squad. Ndidi turned out to be the Nigerian to gloat over, as he was influential in his team’s 3-1 victory, with a top grade show for the whole duration of the game, after which he took to social media to reveal that he was pleased with the squad’s performance, with a short post that read: ‘Love It Boys.’

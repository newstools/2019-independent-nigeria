P/Harcourt – Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has unveiled ‘16-point people-oriented projects’ to be commissioned across the state as part of activities marking his 100 days in office for second term.
Secretary to the State Government, Tammy Danagogo, who disclosed this on Friday while highlighting events marking the celebration said key projects to be commissioned between September 9 and 27 cut across education, road, commerce, labour and sports.
“Wike, upon inception of this government in 2015, made it clear that he will pursue a social contract that will make Rivers the pride of all. Throughout his first tenure the Governor entrenched a development agenda that positively transformed the state.
“His unwavering commitment made him enjoy national and international accolades. It was not surprising that Vice President Yemi Osinbajo crowned him with the sobriquet, Mr. Projects. As a man who walk the talk, his first 100 days in the second tenure will be used to showcase his vision of monumental legacies.”
Projects to be unveiled from next week include Community Secondary School in Ubima, Minister of Transport, Rotimi Amaechi’s hometown, Rumuwoji Market Mile 1 Port Harcourt, Civil Servants Quarters, Port Harcourt and Real Madrid Football Academy among others,” he stated.

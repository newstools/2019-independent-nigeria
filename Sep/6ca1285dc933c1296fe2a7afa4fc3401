LAGOS – The Igbo Famers Progressive Union (IFPU) has resolved that its members should modernise their farming methods and production to ensure better yield in the face of imminent food crisis in the country and the need to boost exports from the South East geo-political zone. The forum, in a statement made available to Daily Independent, expressed the farmers’ commitment to the protection of South East land, farms and people against Fulani herdsmen who they alleged, had been terrorising the region through what it termed expansionist agenda. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network While aligning with the communiqué issued by the expanded South East Governors Forum meeting held in Enugu on August 31, 2019, the IFPU stated: “We are encouraged that suddenly, our political leaders are seemingly waking up to the deadly menace constituted by herdsmen terror on our people; destruction and devastation on our lands and farms. “We are, however, concerned that the communiqué seems to hinge on pious hope and not backed by legal deterrents. So, long as there is no positive action by way of legislation through our five State Houses of Assembly, all the measures will end up as another paper tiger.”

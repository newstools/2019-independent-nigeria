FIBA officials have expressed disappointment over D’Tigers failure to qualify for the second round of the ongoing FIBA World Cup in China. Against all expectations, D’Tigers failed to go past the group stage, losing two group games to Russia 77-82 and Argentina 96-83 that put paid to their ambition of reaching the second round. Prior to the event, FIBA officials believe that with the quality of talents at the team’s disposal there was no reason why it should not reach the quarterfinal. Writing on the FIBA site on Tuesday, Julio Chitunde, noted that Nigeria was one of the biggest flops of the World Cup. “Obviously I will go with Nigeria. Since Day 1 of their training camp in Atlanta and because of the talented roster they brought to China, I always believed this could be the year that an African team would reach the quarterfinals, but things didn’t go their way,” he stated, believing that the team could make up at the 2020 Olympics. “Hopefully, they can do better in Tokyo next year. The talent is there, I just don’t understand what is missing. With all due respect to Argentina and Russia, I feel that these two teams who beat Nigeria in the group phase were in Nigeria’s reach. Maybe they lacked a bit more team effort. I don’t know.” In his own contribution, Igor Curkovic thinks its Nigeria and Germany that were the biggest flops of the tournament. “Croatia. No, wait… Nigeria and Germany. I’ve talked to the Nigerians in Wuhan, and almost all of them said that the defeats to Russia and Argentina could’ve been avoided with just a bit more experience of playing this event and playing together. “So, Tokyo 2020 sounds like a perfect chance for Nigerian redemption. As for Germany, it’s still unclear what happened to the team that was running circles around everybody in the preparation period.”

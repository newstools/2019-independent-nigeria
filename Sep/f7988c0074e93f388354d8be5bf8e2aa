Japan’s controversial annual dolphin hunt is underway in waters close to the coastal village of Taiji. During the hunt, which has been carried out for decades, the animals are rounded up and driven into shallow waters where they are trapped by nets, before being slaughtered with knives.

The hunt began on Sunday, but the first 12 boats which left the port returned with no catch, according to local media. However, on Monday, crews caught and killed five Risso’s dolphins – a species closely related to pilot whales. The practice is criticised as cruel by campaign groups which say the dolphins can take up to 30 minutes to die by drowning or suffocation.

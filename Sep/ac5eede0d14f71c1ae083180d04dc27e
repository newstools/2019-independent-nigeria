Spain’s High Court on Monday ordered that a fugitive Peruvian Supreme Court judge should be extradited home to face charges of influence peddling among other crimes, rejecting his allegation that he was a victim of political persecution. Cesar Hinostroza has been at the centre of a cronyism scandal since phone conversations recorded by police in a drug trafficking probe were leaked to the media, allegedly revealing what prosecutors have described as a criminal network of judges who traded favours with politicians and businessmen, Reuters reports. He has denied committing any crimes. He was captured in Madrid last October after fleeing Peru through normal border exit points in an embarrassment to Peruvian President Martin Vizcarra’s tough anti-corruption drive. He has been held in jail awaiting extradition hearings.

Saudi Arabia’s crown prince has warned the price of oil could spike to “unimaginably high” levels unless action is taken against Iran, the kingdom’s main enemy. Mohammad bin Salman’s comments come after attacks on Saudi oil facilities knocked out 5 percent of global supply. The finger has been pointed at Iran which denies involvement in the attacks, The UK Independent Newspaper reports. Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler told CBS: “If the world does not take strong and firm action to deter Iran, we will see further escalations that will threaten world interests. Oil supplies will be disrupted and oil prices will jump to unimaginably high numbers that we haven’t seen in our lifetimes.”

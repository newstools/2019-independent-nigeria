Consumers and users of the popular who now feel cajoled and swindled by the cab-hiring app, Bolt (formerly called Taxify), are presently bemoaning what they consider as multiple debits for services that had been previously paid for. It has become obvious that the app may be facing a major hiccup with its services in Nigeria at the moment as a good number of the customers keep complaining that their debit cards attached to the app are being debited severally for already settled services. A host of them currently lament on social media that the app may have been hacked; hence advising themselves to remove and delink their debit cards from the app. According to Weetracker: “Many Bolt users in Nigeria have expressed concern over the ongoing issue, with several people complaining of several debit alerts from their bank accounts for rides that they already took and paid for.” Bolt has, actually issued a statement and confirmed the problem but has shunned any talk of the app suffering some kind of hack attack. In a series of tweets, Bolt Nigeria says it was aware of the recent complaints and was working with its payment processors to fix the problem.

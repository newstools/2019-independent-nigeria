ABUJA – Minister of Sports and Youth Development, Sunday Dare has said a whooping N1.2 billion will be required by the Federal Government to maintain stadia in most states of the country, on an annual basis. He said it would not be feasible to provide such funding in view of the budgetary constraints, hence government would explore options to bridge the gaps. He however added that government may consider concessioning most of the stadia to private sector as a way of ensuring proper maintenance in line with international standards. Dare’s explanation came amidst criticism of poor maintenance of most stadia, in spite of huge cost that went into their construction. “Government is serious about renovating sports facilities in the country, especially the dilapidated federal stadia across the country, but to maintain any of the public stadia scattered across the country, it will cost nothing less than N1.2billion,” he noted. He revealed that preparations for year 2020 Olympic games in Tokyo, Japan has began, noting that there are plans to send most of the coaches to countries with better facilities as a way of enhancing their technical competence.

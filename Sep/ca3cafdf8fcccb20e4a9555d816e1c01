Legendary Gambo Mohammed, the long-time captain of Kano Pillars has revealed that he could still take up coaching job at a later date despite turning down the chance of getting trained as a professional coach by the club. It will be recalled that the player parted company with the management of Kano Pillars after he could not agree on his future designation at the club. The ‘Sai Masu Gida’ had suggested that he proceed on a coaching course at the Nigeria Institute for Sports (NIS) in Lagos but the player turned the offer down on personal reason. Writing on their website, the club said: “Gambo Muhammad has decided to leave the club after he did not agree with the management decision to send him to a coaching course at the National Institute of Sports, (NIS) as recommended by the technical crew of the club in their last season report,” The statement released by Pillars read in part. “Initially, Kano Pillars wanted to retain Gambo that is why they decided to send him to coaching course but because of reasons best known to him he did not accept that Idea.” But the player had been reported to have admitted that he could still venture into coaching at a later stage of his post-playing career, agreeing that he could be heading to another club. “I did not take the offer from Kano Pillars to go to NIS for personal reason but I can still find myself coaching at a point in time. It all depends on my choice at any time. “For now, I am hoping to continue playing,” a source in the club quoted the player as saying.

The ‘newbreed’ Super Eagles of Nigeria on Tuesday were forced to a 2-2 draw Ukraine in an international friendly played at the Dnipro Arena. The Super Eagles were two goals up scored in the first 45th minutes but lost the opportunity to shocking the world with a victory over the opponents. Home boy, Ayodele Aribo scored the first goal of the match in the fourth minute of play for Nigeria while Victor Osimehen converted a penalty kick in the 34th minute for the Super Eagles second goal after Samuel Chukwueze was brought down in the penalty box. On resumption of the second half, the Super Eagles lost concentration towards the last 25 minutes of the match as Ukraine piled pressures on the team and got the needed results in quick succession in the 77th and 78th minutes to level scores at 2-2. It would be recalled that Nigeria and Ukraine have never met at senior level, but a group phase clash at the FIFA U20 World Cup in Poland earlier in the summer ended 1-1. Ukraine eventually won the championship.

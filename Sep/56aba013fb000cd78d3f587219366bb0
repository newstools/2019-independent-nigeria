Prices of imported rice which had remain stable for some time started skyrocketing last month, but became evident as it increased further in the week under review. The sharp rise in the prices of the commodity, especially when compared with what they were previously sold, left consumers, particularly the common folks, with no choice than to groan. The commodity is a staple food in Nigeria and consumed by all and sundry regardless of the social class. Apart from eating rice as a normal meal, it is considered as one of the best food for ceremonies in Nigeria. In fact, there is no ceremony that rice is not included among menu that would be served to guests. But since the ban of some  imported items which includes rice  by the Federal Government coupled with the pronouncement made last month to block all borders, smugglers are finding it difficult to bring in the commodity into  the Nigerian market for fear of incurring  severe loses if caught by the Nigeria Customs. The situation has led to scarcity of the commodity and the few traders who are still involved in the business, not minding the cost; have to cough out huge sum of money to procure the commodity. The shortfall in supply, however, has an adverse effect on the prices of the commodity as consumers are made to bear the brunt. Findings by the Business and Market Intelligence Unit of SUNDAY INDEPENDENT revealed that prices of imported rice grew by over 10 and 15 per cent in some markets from August to September 12, 2019. The survey results indicated that reasons predominantly mentioned for the hike were unavailability and closure of all surrounding borders. During the week, checks at the Ogbeogologo and Igbudu markets, Delta State, showed that prices of imported rice had soared. For example, a 50kg bag that was earlier sold for between N18,000 and N18,500 rose, currently ranging from N20,000 to N21,000, depending on the haggling power of the  customer and the market. Mr. Ejoh Friday, who trades in all kinds of grains at the Ogbeogologo Market Asaba, attributed the hike to shortfall in supply. That of Nkwo Market, Nnewi, Anambra State, also witnessed an upsurge of  12 percent as a 50kg bag of imported rice that previously went for between N17,500 and N18,000 attracted between N19,500 and N20,000. A large number of traders at the Nkwo Market, Nnewi, linked the situation to scarcity arising from the closure of surrounding borders. In Umuahia Main Market, Abia State, the trend was not at variance with that of Nkwo Market, especially with the prices of a 50kg bag of the commodity currently going for N20,000 up from N18,000 formerly sold. For Itam Market, Uyo, a 50kg bag of imported rice attracted between N18,000 and N19,000 as against N17,000 initially sold. Madam Christy Nyang, who sells the commodity at the Itam Market, Uyo, in a chat with our Correspondent, ascribed the situation to scarcity. This is just as Mr. Chukwudi John, another trader of same market, blamed the hike on the recent announcement made by the Federal Government that all borders should be closed without ensuring that the locally produced rice can service the entire citizenry at a reasonable amount. For Oba Market, Benin City, the trend was the same. For example, prices of a 50kg bag of imported rice that previously went for between N16,000 and N16,500, went up, selling for  between 17,500 and N18,000 within the review week. The situation saw many of the traders at the Oba Market, Benin City, complaining of low sales as well as consumers lamenting of the hike as they were left with no option than to reduce their normal purchases. Visit to Wuse Market, Abuja, showed that prices of the commodity were at an upward trend, especially with prices of a 50kg bag currently going for between N17,500 and N18,500 as  against between N16,000 and N17,500 previously sold. Mr. Elisha Ndubuwa, who trades in the commodity at the Wuse Market, Abuja, blamed the situation to inadequate supply and high foreign exchange rate. At the Lafenwa Market, Ogun State, a 50kg bag of imported rice that was initially sold for between N13,000 and N13,500 increased to between  N15,000 and N15,500, of which many of the traders linked the hike to scarcity resulting  from the ban of the commodity by the Federal Government. The same could be said for that of Bodija Market, Ibadan, as prices of a 50kg bag of imported rice that previously declined to between N13,500 and N14,500 went up again, currently ranging from N15,000 to N16,500. But this depends on the bargaining power of the consumer and the type of brand. In Lagos, visit to popular markets such as Daleko, Mile 12, Iddo and Oshodi revealed that the commodity was scarce as some shops at the Daleko Market, Lagos, that used to display the commodity in bulk did not open and the few ones that were in operation have reduced their purchases for continuity. Prices of the commodity were, however, not favourable especially to consumers as they are currently on the high side ; for example, a 50kg bag of imported rice previously sold for between N13,000 and N13,500 at the Daleko Market, Lagos,  went up  and currently sells  for between N14,500 and N15,000, signifying a 12 percent rise. But at other markets where the commodity is not sold in wholesale price, a 50kg bag of imported rice currently goes for between N17,500 and N18,500 up from between N15,500 and N16,000 previously sold. The worst hits are consumers who buy the commodity in smaller measures as the impact of the hike does not enhance their purchasing power.

Following the explosive AriseTv interview with Fatoyinboâ€™s former spiritual mentors, Busola Olotu and Emmanuel Oset, in which she confirmed his alleged forceful carnal knowledge of several girls and women, one of them allegedly being a pregnant woman, activist, @Segalink has revealed that the Nigerian Police Force is yet to act on the petition filed against the COZA pastor. The charges, which accuse him of forcing a lady named as Ifeoluwa Dolapo into committing an abortion which later claimed her life, named two other well-known pastors, Prophet Abiara and Rev. Funke Adejumo as alleged accomplices.

Lagos – Chief Lanre Razak, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), in Lagos and a former Public Transportation Commissioner in the state has said that Babajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu, Governor of the state needs the support of all to succeed in the onerous task of moving the state forward to the next level.
He stated this while speaking with newsmen in his Lagos office, expressing delight that, Sanwo-Olu has started on a very good note within the first 100 days in office.
Razak, however urged Lagos residents to double their support for him, stressing that from the looks of things, Lagos people are in for a good time under this workaholic team player.
Speaking further he said that one of the major ways to assist any government to succeed is payment of taxes as at when due, reminding that, it is through tax that the Internally Generated Revenue (IGR), could be shored up to guarantee more dividends of democracy to the people.
“I hereby appeal to the good people of Lagos to uphold their civic responsibilities through payment of their taxes for more development, growth and progress of the state to enable it maintain its position as one of the most viable economies on the African continent. And I can assure you that, any revenue accrues from such social responsibility would be prudently managed because of Sanwo-Olu’s financial frugality,” he said.
Razak also urged the people to sustain peaceful co-existence among the various ethnic groups and religious adherents in the state, reminding that chaos is antithetical to economic growth, social comfort and religious harmony.
On the newly inaugurated cabinet, Razak congratulated the Lagos people on the assemblage of the star-studded team, enthusing that, “with the team, Lagos people can go to sleep with their eyes closed as the tested and trusted hands in the cabinet would perform wonders.”
Speaking on security challenges in Nigeria, the elder statesman called for vigilance by every individual because, according to him, security of any community is a collective responsibility of the generality of the citizenry.

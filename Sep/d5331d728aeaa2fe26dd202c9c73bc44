The recent ban on imported food items which includes frozen foods coupled with the pronouncement by the Federal Government that all borders should be closed for a specific period has resulted to the prices of the commodity hit the rooftops. Again, the enforcement of the order by the Nigeria Customs has worsened the situation as smugglers are finding it extremely difficult to bring in barred items especially into the Nigerian market. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Prior to the announcement on closure of all borders, despite the ban on some imported items by the Federal Government, smugglers still ensured  that the barred food items in one way or the other gain entry into the Nigerian market. But this time, the situation appeared to be precarious and unfavourable to traders, particularly as majority of them have to cough out huge amount of money to sustain their normal supplies and some in the process may incur a colossal loss if their items are seized by the Nigerian Customs. Because of the risky nature of the business, some of the traders have abandoned the trade and the few ones that are still into it, have no choice but to opt for the local frozen foods popularly referred to as ‘Nigeria chicken’. They, however, complained of low patronage as a good number of consumers still preferred the imported ones. Visits to markets across some states showed prices of frozen foods have escalated by over 15 per cent from mid-August to August 29, 2019. Findings showed that many of the traders’ connected the hike principally to scarcity arising from the closure of surrounding borders, high demand and cost of logistics among others. During the week, checks at the Wuse Market, Abuja, revealed that prices of frozen foods witnessed a surge, particularly with the prices of a carton of chicken lap currently going for between N12,000 and N13,000 as against N10,500 sold before. For that of turkey, prices of a carton attracted between N15,000 and 15,500, up from N13,000 earlier sold. Prices of a kilo of chicken, however, attracted N1,300 while that of turkey was N1,500. Mrs. Regina Egbuna, who trades in frozen chicken at the Wuse Market, Abuja, blamed the situation on limited supply owing to the ban on imported smuggled goods. That of Achau Market, Kaduna, also soared from what was sold earlier. For example, a carton of frozen chicken lap sold earlier for between N10,000 and N10,500 increased, currently selling for between N12,000 and 12,500 while the few shops that had frozen turkey  sold it for between N14,000 and N14,500 up from N13,500 previously sold. Many of the traders at the Achau Market, Kaduna, linked the hike to the closure of surrounding borders. The same could be said for that of Ogbeogologo Market, Asaba, as a carton of frozen chicken that previously went for between N12,000  and N12,500 soared by over 15 per cent to  N14,000 while that of a frozen turkey also increased to between N16,000 and N16,500 from N15,000  sold previously. Prices of a kilo of chicken and turkey currently go for N1,400 and N1,600 respectively. Mr. Friday Ibie, who deals in frozen foods at the Ogbeogologo Market, Asaba, in a chat with our correspondent, connected the exorbitant prices to a sharp cut in supply due to the closure of borders. This is just as Madam Mariam of same market shared the same view with him, but attributed the situation to severe scarcity due to complete enforcement of the ban by Nigeria Customs. In Ose Market, Onitsha, the trend was not at variance with that of Ogbeogologo Market, Asaba, as prices of the commodity also soared further. For instance, prices of a carton of frozen chicken laps currently sell for within the region of N13,000 and N13,500 as against N12,500 initially sold while that of frozen turkey which previously went for N14,000 soared, currently ranging from N15,500 to N16,000 of which, most of the traders also blamed on high reduction in supply. Prices of a kilo of chicken at the Ose Market, Onitsha, went for N1,300 while that of turkey was sold for N1,600 against N1,500 previously sold. At the Lafenwa Market, Ogun State, despite the proximity to the border, the commodity was in short supply and the few shops that still had frozen foods in stock boost up the prices due to increased demand. For example, a carton of frozen chicken that was earlier going for between N9,000 and N9,500 soared to between N11,500 and N12,000 while that of turkey attracted between N13,500 to N12,000 from N11,000 previously sold. Many of the traders who are still in the business at the Lafenwa Market, Ogun State, linked the situation to the determination by the Federal Government to put a permanent stop to smuggling in Nigeria. Checks at the Bodija Market, Ibadan, also indicated that prices of frozen foods have increased further from what they were previously sold. Prices of a carton of frozen chicken laps which formerly attracted between N9,500 and N10,000 went up by over 20 per cent, currently ranging from N12,000 to 12,500 while that of turkey previously sold for N12,000 rose to between N14,000 and N15,000. Mr. Haruna Abegunde, who trades in the commodity at the Bodija Market, Ibadan, in a chat with SUNDAY INDEPENDENT, ascribed the hike to high cost of logistics. In Lagos, nearly all the cold rooms have been shut as a result of the closure of all the borders. Some of the few ones that are still in operations opted for the local frozen foods so as not to close business. But checks at some frozen foods in popular markets such as Oshodi, Ogba and Ago palace way, Okota, all in Lagos, revealed that prices of the commodity be it local or imported  have escalated the more. For example, shops that have imported frozen chicken laps sold a carton for between N12,500 and N13,500  as against between N9,500 and N10,000 initially sold. Likewise, that of turkey also rose to between N14,500 and N15,000 up from between N12,000 and N13,000 earlier sold. That of Nigeria chicken also soared to N1,300 from N1,100 previously sold due to increased demand. Prices of a kilo of frozen chicken laps that previously went for between N900 and N1,000 increased to N1,300 while that of turkey goes for between N1,500 and N1,600 up from N1,400 sold before. Many of the traders at the Ogba Market, Lagos, connected the situation to the ban and the closure of all borders, creating room for scarcity.

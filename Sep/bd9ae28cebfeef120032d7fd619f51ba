The U.S. Navy confirmed this week that three leaked videos of unidentified flying objects were the real deal, calling them “unidentified aerial phenomena.” The videos, which were shared by To the Stars Academy of Arts and Science and the New York Times in 2017 and 2018, appear to show flying craft on grainy video that caused shock and awe even to the fighter pilots who witnessed them. “The three videos (one from 2004 and two from 2015) show incursions into our military training ranges by unidentified aerial phenomena,” Navy spokesman Joseph Gradisher said in a statement. “The Navy has characterized the observed phenomena as unidentified.” To the Stars Academy of Arts and Science, dedicated to the study of UFOs and extraterrestrial life, brought broad attention to the three videos after extensively sharing and discussing them. TSSAS was co-founded by the former lead singer of Blink-182, Tom DeLonge, who has spent much of the last several years dedicated to studying aerial phenomena. The three videos are known as “FLIR1,” “Gimbal,” and “GoFast” among the internet, though the Navy declined to use the names in their statement. The Navy did confirm that the oldest video, known as FLIR1, was filmed on an aircraft from the USS Nimitz in 2004. While TSSAS asserted that the videos had gone through a declassification process, the Navy said that they were not sure how the videos were leaked to the public. The oldest video was said to have been widely shared aboard the Nimitz, but when the Navy was made aware of the leak in 2009, they declined to pursue the matter, citing the large crew size of 5,000 and the amount of time elapsed

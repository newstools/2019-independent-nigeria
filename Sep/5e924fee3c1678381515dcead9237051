Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp took a swipe at title rivals Manchester City by claiming he would rather win eight matches 1-0 than beat a side 8-0. The Reds scraped past Sheffield United by the slenderest of margins at Bramall Lane after a tough encounter against Chris Wilder’s side. With City having blown away Watford 8-0 last weekend Klopp was asked how it important it was to be able to grind out 1-0 wins, a victory which made it seven out of seven in the league this season and keep them well clear of Pep Guardiola’s team. “Eight times 1-0 is more important than one time 8-0 but if you give me a guarantee for it, I take the next eight games,” said the Reds boss. “We are very critical for ourselves. I said before, is it allowed that Sheffield United fight more than us? No it isn’t. “Is it allowed they run more? No. We can play better. I don’t think we had an off-day.” In truth Liverpool laboured for 70 minutes and it required a huge stroke of luck courtesy of Dean Henderson’s handling error to make the breakthrough. The on-loan Manchester United goalkeeper was left embarrassed after allowing Georginio Wijnaldum’s shot to slip through his hands and then his legs before creeping over the line.

LAGOS – The Lagos State Government has said that the that the arrest of 123 Suspects by the State Task Force was a routine security check and not targeted at a particular section of the country as being speculated in the social media. Commissioner for Information in the state, Gbenga Omotoso in a statement, emphasised that the checks and arrest made by men of the state Task Force, was a proactive step, against speculated cases of Boko haram insurgency and banditry attacks across the nation.
According to him, “On the directives of the State Commissioner of Police, Mr. Zubairu Muazu, the arrested suspects have been moved to the State Police Command where they are being profiled and if nothing incriminating is established against them, they will be released immediately.”
The Commissioner affirmed the State Government’s commitment to the security and well being of law abiding residents of the State, noting that the mass movement of the arrested suspects with large quantity of used motorcycles aroused the suspicion of Lagosians who duly alerted men of the State Task Force.
He further said that Lagos is haven for law abiding residents, and foreigners with legitimate intentions, describing social media report that the arrests were directed at a particular section of the country, as handiwork of mischief makers.
“The case on hand is purely a security matter, which the Lagos Police Command is capable of handling professionally.
“The administration of Mr. Babajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu has clearly stated that Lagos is home for all and will continue to make it, the most preferred destination in the world,” Omotoso added.

The PDP Youth Vanguard added that the job of the committee was to conduct primary and not to set fire of confusion in the state. The group added that PDP is known as a party that conducts free, fair and transparent primary, unlike the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) that takes directive from above. The group further said that Bayelsa is known as PDP state and “nothing should jeopardise that status because of personal interest. The primary should be conducted in the interest of all the PDP members. “PDP is a family and all must be treated equal. Preferential treatment should not be given to any set of people. We are saying this because, we don’t want anything that will disturb the peace and unity PDP family is enjoying in Bayelsa State. “Governor Ishaku-led electoral committee should put this into consideration and conduct a peaceful primary devoid of rancour and avoidable crisis,” it said. The group also pointed out that primary devoid of crisis would give the party undeniable victory in the November 16 governorship election, as Bayelsa people would like to associate with the party that is peaceful.

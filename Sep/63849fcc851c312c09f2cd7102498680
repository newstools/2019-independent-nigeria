Canada has appointed veteran business consultant Dominic Barton as ambassador to China, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Wednesday, as the government grapples with a major diplomatic and trade dispute between the nations. Barton, 56, a Ugandan-born Canadian who stepped down as global managing partner of consulting firm McKinsey & Co last year, has extensive experience in China and is close to Trudeau’s Liberal government. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network “His years of experience in Asia, and the significant global economics expertise he has acquired over an impressive career, will make him a great choice,” Trudeau said in a statement. Barton replaces John McCallum, whom Trudeau fired in January for commenting on the case of Huawei executive who was arrested in Canada and is fighting extradition to the United States. Beijing, which has demanded Canada return Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou, has blocked imports of Canadian canola seeds and pork and beef products. It has also charged two Canadian men with spying. Canada’s Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, noting “some significant challenges in the relationship”, said it was vital to choose an envoy who Beijing knew would have direct access to Trudeau. She also told reporters in Toronto that Barton would be expected to stress the importance of human rights, a highly sensitive topic for the Chinese government.

ASABA – Coach of the Nigerian U23 Team, Imama Amapakabo expressed confidence towards the success of the team in the upcoming U23 African Championship billed to hold in Egypt in November. Having suffered a 1-0 defeat in the first leg, the U23 team of Nigeria walloped their Sudanese counterpart 5-0 on Tuesday at the Stephen Keshi Stadium, Asaba to book a ticket in the upcoming U23 African Cup of Nations (AFCON) on 5-1 goals aggregate. The team sparked into light within nine minutes of play as Taiwo Awoniyi headed home from close range. However, Ndifreke Effiong scored two goals to make the scoreline 3-0 at halftime as substitute Sunday Faleye scored the fourth goal after few minutes of coming on. He then provided an assist for top goal scorer in the Nigerian Professional Football League (NPFL), Sunusi Ibrahim who tapped home from close range to complete the route. According to Amapakabo, “We are looking forward to the tournament in Cairo, we do not know who our opponents will be but you can see the boys did well. Egypt here we come”. He then praised home based player, Ibrahim for his impact. While he attributed the loss to the Sudanese in the first leg to the lack of time to integrate local and foreign players, he promised that the team will not disappoint in Egypt. “We do better when we are at home because we have four to five training sessions unlike when we play away. I am sure the players will not disappoint in Egypt” he said.

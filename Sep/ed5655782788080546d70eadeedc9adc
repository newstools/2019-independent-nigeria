Controversial Nollywood actor, Uche Maduagwu, has advised pretty screen diva, Juliet Ibrahim, to avoid men who he describes as ‘morally bankrupt’ if she hopes to experience marriage again. Recall that the alluring thespian’s marriage to her ex-hubby, Kwadwo Safo Jnr. crashed about four years ago when she discovered her husband had impregnated another lady. Her relationship with singer, Iceberg Slim also ended barely a year ago. In his advice to Ibrahim, Maduagwu, who has cultivated the habit of courting media attention with his incessant backlash on fellow celebrities, said it is better for the actress to be in a relationship with a broke man than one who cheats. “If you want to smell marriage again, avoid men who are morally bankrupt. My dear, a man that can cheat on you for years without you knowing is morally bankrupt. It is even better to be in a relationship with a boyfriend that is broke because one day, God will open doors for him, than a comfortable man that is morally bankrupt,” he wrote on Instagram.

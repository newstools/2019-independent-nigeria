A former Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, Chief Emeka Anyaoku, has called on the Federal Government to scale up its budgetary allocation to the country’s education sector. This, according to him, would make the country be on the same pedestal with other nations. Anyaoku gave the advice at the 6th Annual Memorial Lecture held in honour of late Dr. Olusegun Agagu, a former governor of Ondo State, which held at the Civic Cenre, Victoria Island in Lagos. He regretted that the country’s current budgetary allocation to the education sector was below the standard set by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO). Anyaoku also advised that informal education should be encouraged and embraced since they were tools for nation building. Also, speaking at the event, Lagos State deputy governor, Dr. Obafemi Hamzat, who called for the prioritisation of education to attract increased budgetary allocations, disclosed that Lagos state was moving toward achieving the goal of feeding all its pupils. Hamzat said that Nigerians should embrace agriculture, adding that, “Agriculture is a major tool in developing any nation’s economy. “Lagos State has acquired 3,000 hectares of land in Osun for the purpose of agriculture. We have also signed an agreement for the purchase of farm lands in Ogun. We are going to be producing 36 tonnes of rice daily; therefore, with time Lagos will produce enough rice to feed the nation,” he said. The deputy governor pointed out that because of the increase in the production of rice and due to the stoppage of rice importation into Nigeria, some companies in China and Singapore had to shut down. He, however, called on other state governments to emulate Lagos so that the expenditure on imported commodities would drop.

LAGOS – Prince Tony Momoh, a former Minister of Information,Tuesday reacted to the claims of Afenifere, a pan-Yoruba socio-political organization, that Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo’s position has been rendered impotent and useless by the Presidency. Speaking in an interview with DAILY INDEPENDENT, he accused Afenifere and the opposition of trying to create problem where there is none. While accusing Afenifere of mischief, Momoh, one of the national leaders of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) said President Muhammadu Buhari has a perfect working relationship with Osinbajo and as such will not do anything to undermine his office. He said, “The constitutional duty to head the Economic Council which the Vice-President is the chairman and has the governors as members, is that not the constitutional role of the Vice- President? Is the Economic Advisory Council set up by President Muhammadu Buhari replacing that? I don’t think it is replacing that. “There is no way the President could have set up that programme without the involvement of the Vice-President himself. So, if anybody says that it is meant to undermine the Vice- President, then that person either does not know what he is talking about or he is just being mischievous. “I don’t think that Afenifere is so unenlightened as to come to such conclusion. So, I read mischief into whoever issued that statement on behalf of Afenifere. We are on journey to 2023, we shall see what happens to Osinbajo and I can tell you that Osinbajo is not a flash in the pan office holder. “He is a constitutional office holder and himself and the President are like two sides of a coin, united together more than any set of President and Vice- President since 1999,” he said.

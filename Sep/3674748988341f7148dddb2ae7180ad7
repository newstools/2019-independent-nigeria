Lionel Messi is unlikely to feature for Barcelona before the next international break as he continues to recover from a thigh problem. The Argentinian was dealt a fresh injury blow in Tuesday’s 2-1 win over Villarreal, coming off at half-time and subsequently missing Saturday’s victory away at Getafe. It has been a frustrating start to the season for Messi, who is yet to complete 90 minutes after missing the Spanish champions’ first four matches with a calf injury. And Sport are reporting that he is expected to return after the next international break in three weeks’ time. Messi’s latest knock is a huge blow for Ernesto Valverde, who would have hoped to have his star man fit for Wednesday’s crunch Champions League clash with Inter Milan. Antonio Conte’s Nerazzurri are likely to pose a serious threat at the Nou Camp having won their first six games of the Serie A season. Prior to the win at Getafe, Valverde assured Barca fans that Messi’s new injury is not a serious problem, but he isn’t sure when the 32-year-old will return. “I don’t know how long he will be out for, we hope he can return to the team soon,” he said. “It’s not serious, it’s a small strain but we’re going to see how he improves next week. “If he returns soon it’s a boost for us and if not then we will be missing a player who is absolutely decisive. “But we have the resources to manage without him, it’s a setback, but we need to keep going.” Barca currently sit fourth in La Liga having taken 13 points from their first seven games of the season. They sit two points behind leaders and arch-rivals Real Madrid, who are yet to suffer defeat this term. Valverde’s men drew blank in their Champions League opener away at Borussia Dortmund last week and will hope to get off the mark when Inter come to town this week. Messi is not the only injury concern for the hosts, with Samuel Umtiti and Ansu Fati also out and Jordi Alba and Ousmane Dembele doubts to feature.

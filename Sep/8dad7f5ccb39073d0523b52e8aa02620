ADO-EKITI – Senate Spokesman, Dayo Adeyeye, has filed a 19-ground appeal against the verdict of Ekiti State Election Tribunal, which declared the immediate past Senate Minority Leader, Abiodun Olujimi, as actual winner of Ekiti- South Senatorial District held on February 23, 2019. In the notice of appeal filed on Monday at the Ado-Ekiti Division of the Court of Appeal, the Chairman of Senate Committee on Media and Public Affairs is seeking two reliefs in his bid to upturn Olujimi’s victory at the tribunal. Adeyeye prayed the appellate court “to allow the appeal and set aside the declaration and return of Olujimi.” Adeyeye contested on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and sought re-election on the platform of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). The APC candidate, who assembled a team of lawyers led by a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Dayo Akinlaja, to win back, urged the court to compel the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to return him as winner of the disputed election. Respondents in the appeal are: Olujimi (1st), PDP (2nd), INEC (3rd) and APC (4th) as the appellant is challenging the whole decision of the tribunal. The three-member panel of the tribunal led by Justice D.D. Adeck, in a judgment delivered on September 10, 2019, ordered INEC to withdraw the Certificate of Return given to Adeyeye and issue a fresh one to Olujimi.

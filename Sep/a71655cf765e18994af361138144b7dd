ADO- EKITI – The Obarisa Agbaye of Ijo Olorisa Parapo ati Asa Adulawo Organisation, Oba Jamiu Adewale Eletu has thrown his weight behind the agitation for establishment of community-based policing. Addressing journalists in Ado- Ekiti on Sunday ahead of the proposed maiden edition of the IGBARUNMOLE FESTIVAL billed to hold in Ekiti, the head of the traditional religion adherents also called on stakeholders in Yorubaland to rise to the occasion on festering incidents of kidnappings and banditry. Oba Eletu hinted that the festival is meant to celebrate the 201 gods that are recognised in the Yoruba mythology and further reawaken our consciousness and strengthen our spirituality towards our continued survival as humans. Eletu, who is the Alawoyaya of Awoyaya, Ibeju Lekki, Lagos, attributed the unwillingness of some members of the public to volunteer information on kidnappers to lack of thrust by the security agent. Oba Eletu alleged that the bad eggs within the force were making the issue of intelligence gathering difficult since nobody feels secured after volunteering useful tips to the Police. The ongoing fight against kidnappings is not successful in the South-West because some indigenes were conniving with the marauding herdsmen. According to him, the Yorubas have their own way of protecting their territory from the time immemorial which is very efficient.” It is high time we rigged this ancient security model and combining with the proposed community based policing. This, I believe, will save the region from the imminent danger of conquest by the marauding invaders.” He said: “Kidnapping is a serious issue. It is necessary for Youruba to beware, else what we don’t want will happen to us. Those blaming the Fulani herdsmen should also try and look inwards. No one can come from Kano or Jos and know our terrain. There are fifth columnists among us. Some farms were being used as hideouts and owners are collecting commissions from these criminals

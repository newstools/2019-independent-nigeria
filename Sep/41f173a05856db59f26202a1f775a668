Akure – Unity Party of Nigeria (UPN) has called on Ondo State government to strengthen the security apparatus in the state for safety of lives and property. The state Chairman of the party, Mr Rotimi Boboye, who gave the charge on Saturday during the party’s State Working Committee meeting in Akure, described the security situation in the state as worrisome and disturbing. Boboye said: “We had a meeting today to review the political situation in our dear state and how UPN could be moved forward. We also talked about threatening security situation in the state, especially in Akure, the state capital. “There is a place called Ijoka area where bandits do carry out nefarious activities without being checked. Just this week, a professor from the state-owned university was kidnapped and his dead body was later found without anyone yet to be arrested.” He expressed fear that there was a serious threat to safety of lives and properties, saying it was the responsibility of the state governor, Chief Rotimi Akeredolu  to provide security for the people. According to him, “There is security vote for governor but we do not know if it’s judiciously spent. If it is, we believe that security lapses would have been taken care of. “So,we want to appeal to the governor to address the issue of insecurity and increase his efforts so that people can sleep with two eyes close.” Boboye alleged that a particular area of the state enjoyed government patronage than others in terms of developmental projects, tasking the governor to spread his developmental programmes to all senatorial districts. Reacting to the allegations, the state Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Donald Ojogo said, “With what the governor is doing and if anybody says he cannot see it then, we cannot glorify such people.”

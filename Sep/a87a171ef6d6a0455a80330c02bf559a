Akure – Senior Pastor of the Awaiting The Second Coming Of Jesus Christ Gospel Church has commended President Muhammadu Buhari for boycotting the World Economic Forum in South Africa (WEF).
However, the cleric said withdrawing from the programme was not enough, but urged Buhari to fix Nigeria.
In a statement made available to newsmen on Friday in Akure, the Ondo State capital, Giwa described President Buhari as the father of Nigerians presently and he(Buhari) must be able to tackle challenges facing the country.
“I commend President Buhari and his advisers for withdrawing from the World Economic Forum in South Africa. This gesture, to me, and to notable Nigerians demonstrates that the president feels for our people who are being killed and maltreated in South Africa. However, this is not enough, President Buhari has to fashion out modalities to provide for the needs of Nigerians. We cannot be blessed with natural resources and our people are still in abject poverty. Millions of Nigerians today do not have food to live a healthy active life. I want to appeal to the president to listen to the cries of Nigerians on security, employment, infrastructures among others,” Pastor Giwa stated.

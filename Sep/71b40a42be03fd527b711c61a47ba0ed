KATSINA – Angry youths have reportedly razed the private residence of Secretary to the State Government of Katsina, Alhaji Mustapha Mohammed Inuwa, and the All Progressives Congress (APC) office in Danmusa Local Government Area of Katsina State. The youths were said to be protesting what they described as complicity by the SSG in armed banditry in Danmusa LGA and other areas in the central and southern parts of the state. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The protest started when traders who were returning from Danmusa market were ambushed by armed bandits at the outskirts of the town, an incident which led to the death of one of the traders. A source told Daily Independent that no sooner had the report of the deceased filtered into town than about hundreds of youths from the town mobilised to the scene of the attack and took the body of the deceased to the palace of the district head who fled on sighting the protesters. The source added that the action of the district head further aggravated the annoyance of the youths who turned violent and marched into the country home of the SSG and set it ablaze. “From there, they proceeded to the APC office in Danmusa, which they also burnt down, chanting various slogans to register their dissatisfaction with the way and manner security issues were being handled in the state.” Attempts to speak with the state Police Command’s Public Relations Officer, SP Gambo Isah, proved abortive as calls made to him were not answered. About twenty villages have been overrun by armed bandits in Katsina State in the last one month.

OWERRI – In a bid to ensure a cleaner environment, Imo State government has banned the use of polythene bags for refuse disposal. Ikedi Ohakim, Chairman of the State Sanitation Committee and former governor of the state, made this known on Saturday, shortly after monitoring this month’s state environmental sanitation exercise within the Owerri capital city and its environs. Ohakim, who reiterated the state government’s determination to restore the state to its premier position as the cleanest and most beautiful state in the country, warned roadside and street traders to relocate to markets or be prepared to face the full weight of the law established in this regard. According to him, “From now henceforth, nobody is allowed to use polythene bags in this state to dispose refuse and anybody who dumps refuse in unauthorised places, will henceforth be sanctioned accordingly.” He disclosed that his committee had already desilted 16, 000 klm of roads with drainages previously blocked by refuse. He, however, commended the state governor, Emeka Ihedioha for providing new engineering dump sites in the three senatorial zones of Owerri, Okigwe and Orlu and enjoined the residents of the state to make maximum use of the facilities.

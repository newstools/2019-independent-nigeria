Thousands of people took to the streets across the United Kingdom today to protest Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s plan to suspend parliament. There are more than 30 protests planned in cities around the U.K., according to the BBC. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The largest protest is taking place in London, where protestors gathered outside the gates of No. 10 Downing Street with banners reading “stop the coup” and “defend democracy,” the Guardian reported. Demonstrators are protesting Johnson’s decision to suspend the U.K. parliament, which critics argue gives MPs little time to thwart a no-deal Brexit. The suspension is set to take effect the second week of September — as early as September 9 — and last until October 14. BBC News (UK)

The protests were organized by various groups, including Momentum, which supports opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Meanwhile, Chancellor Sajid Javid defended Johnson’s decision on BBC Radio 4’s Today program on Saturday, saying: “It’s quite usual this time of year for Parliament to go in to a recess. It’s perfectly correct and appropriate to prorogue Parliament.”

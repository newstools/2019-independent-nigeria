UEFA have announced the cap of the price for away tickets in continental competitions, in a move to make fixtures more accessible for fans. Europe’s governing body has faced immense criticism in recent years, particularly back in May due to the high prices for the finals of the Champions League and Europa League, as well as the venue selection from the latter. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Top clubs in the continent were at loggerheads over extortionate prices for travelling supporters, with fans taken advantage of with high demands for tickets, as well as costs for air travel and accommodation. While British clubs have been pressuring UEFA for years, their requests were met with some resistance from their counterparts in Spain and some areas of Southern Europe. However, an agreement has since been reached that means that away tickets for the group stages will cost a maximum of 70 euros (£63.50) in the Champions League and 45 euros (£41) in the Europa League. The cap will come into effect when the group stages of both tournaments begin next month but the figure is higher than the British clubs, and Bayern Munich, were hoping for. Confirming the news, UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said: “Fans are the lifeblood of the game and those who follow their teams to away matches must have access to tickets at a reasonable price, bearing in mind the cost they have already had to incur for their trip. “By capping ticket prices, we want to make sure that away fans can still travel to games and play their part in making the atmosphere inside football stadiums so special.”

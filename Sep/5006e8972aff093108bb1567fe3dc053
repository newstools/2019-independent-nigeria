Sprint hurdler, Tobiloba Amusan and long jumper, Ese Brume will spear Nigeriaâ€™s challenge for podium appearances when the 17th edition of the IAAF flagship event, the World Championships begin today in Doha, Qatar. Amusan, the fourth fastest athlete (12.49 seconds) over the 100m hurdles this year has been in impressive form this season, running a lifetime best in Sotteville, France last July and has legally ducked inside 13 seconds 10 times this season. She looks a cast iron certainty to make her first sprint hurdles final after stumbling at the semi-final stage two years ago in London. Also favoured for a podium appearance is Brume, the 2018 African Championship and 2019 African Games gold medalist in the long jump. Brume is the second best athlete in the world over the horizontal jump so far this year with her 7.05m leap in Bursa, Turkey last month. Sprinters, Divine Oduduru and African Games fastest man, Raymond Ekevwo as well as shot putter, Enekwechi Chukwuebuka can also fancy their chances of making the finals of the 100m and shot put events. Oduduru, the who successfully completed a sprint double in spectacular fashions at the NCAA Championships in Austin, Texas, USA last June, running an incredible 9.86 seconds in the 100m has failed to inspire since then and will look to re-enact his NCAA Championship feat to be considered a contender. Ekevwo surprised in Rabat when he broke his first 10 seconds in the event (9.96 seconds) to win the African Games gold and can be considered the man in form. He will however needs to run inside 10 seconds again to stand a chance of extending his fairy tale season which began with NCAA Championship 4x100m gold to the podium in Doha. Enekwechi on his part has had a very impressive season, breaking the national record on multiple occasions before steadying it 21.80m, the 10th best mark in the world this season.

The partnership between WPP and Algorithm Media has been sealed.
With this development, Algorithm Media becomes home to brands such as Mediacom, Mindshare and Wavemaker in Nigeria.
WPP and Algorithm Media entered into a deal to deepen their global expansion drive in 2016.
Speaking on the partnership, Seni Adetu, Group CEO of Algorithm Media, stated that the joint venture conforms to the new reform by Advertising Practitioners Council of Nigeria (APCON), on foreign investment in Nigeria, adding that Algorithm Media has a majority stake in the business ownership configuration (75.1%).
In his words: “It was love at first sight with the representative WPP office in Africa as we saw in each other and aligned set of values and connection to the possibilities that this partnership could bring to both parties. Most importantly to the clients, we were looking to sign up. At the onset, we were looking to do a merger and/or acquisition with an existing local agency, but it didn’t work out unfortunately and so, we had to start from scratch.”
Further, Adetu said: “This is where the headroom opportunity is for Algorithm Media. The company was incorporated in 2015 while the affiliation deal was concluded sometime in 2016. As a full-service agency network, we offer exceptional media consultancy services in the areas of media strategy, planning, buying and control using consumer insight garnered from industry research and reliable market intelligence for our various clients.”
The group presently has a number of local and multinational companies as clients including Nokia Mobile, P&G, Canon, Shell, Colgate Palmolive, Facebook, British Airways, GB Foods, Flour Mills of Nigeria, among others.
Algorithm Media is now part of the WPP group conglomerate, which has in its fold – Mindshare, MediaCom, and Ogilvy, noted for innovation, speed, and excellence.

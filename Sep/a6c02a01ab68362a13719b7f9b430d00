UGHELLI – Ahead of the November 16th governorship election in Bayelsa state, the gubernatorial candidate of the Young Progressive Party (YPP), Mr Sunny Pere has promised to accord special attention to the power supply if elected governor.
Pere during an interactive session with electorates on one of his social media platforms, on Tuesday, said there not be meaningful development in any nation without a steady supply of electricity. He said: “In a representative democracy, it is a responsibility to participate in every electioneering processes without any form of inducement and mediocrity. “As a youth in Bayelsa state
and a Nigerian, it has dawned on me that contestants from various political parties wouldn’t have been able to rig elections in their favour in time past if the electorates had resisted. He added, “That is why in our political system here in Bayelsa state, the electorates remain the problem because of their involvement in helping to rig election because of sentiment and mediocrity”.
He pointed out that the electorates know him as a political follower and grassroots mobiliser dedicated to bringing development to the neglected people of Bayelsa state. Pere said since it is the belief that people’s participation in politics is the essence of governance, YPP remains the only platform to give them such opportunities “because by 2023 we want every youth in Bayelsa state to have a sense of responsibility to contest elective positions rather than just being political followers with primordial sentiments and mediocrity.

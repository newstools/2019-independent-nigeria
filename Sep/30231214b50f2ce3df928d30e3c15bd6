After countless setbacks and delays, India will attempt to set a lander down on the Moon in the early hours of 7 September Indian time. If the landing is successful, the nation will be only the fourth to achieve such a feat. Chandrayaan-2 shot into space six weeks ago — more than a year behind schedule— comprising an orbiter and a lander, Vikram, loaded with a six-wheeled rover. The mission’s main aims are to investigate the unexplored lunar south pole and provide the most detailed maps yet of sources of water on the Moon.

Although ISRO crash-landed an impact probe, released by the Chandrayaan-1 lunar orbiter, on the surface in 2008, the Chandrayaan-2 mission is the agency’s first attempt at a ‘soft’ landing. When Vikram is 35 kilometres above the Moon’s surface, its thrusters will fire to slow the craft’s descent from a speed of 6 kilometres a second to almost zero. Although Vikram is designed to select a landing site free of large boulders, the team’s engineers worry that if the site is slightly sloping, or pockmarked with small rocks, the craft could topple, ending its mission. The agency’s chief, Kailasavadivoo Sivan, said at a press conference last month that the automated landing will be the “most terrifying moments” for the organization.

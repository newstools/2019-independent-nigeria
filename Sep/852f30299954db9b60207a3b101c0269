ADO-EKITI – Chief Segun Ajibulu, a United States-based chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has hinted that the current travails of the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo allegedly orchestrated by some cabals in Aso Rock might end up being a blessing in disguise. Ajibulu, a former Commissioner, Pension Commission in Ekiti State who disclosed this in a chat with DAILY INDEPENDENT in Ado-Ekiti, on Saturday, opined that any move that would relieve the Vice President of administrative burden was good for his political career. He explained that President Buhari had entrusted too many tasks on the shoulder of his second in command which hardly allowed him to attend to political matters. Ajibulu acknowledged that even though many watchers of political events in Nigeria believed that the latest moves by the alleged powers that be in Aso Rock were meant to gag or render the office of the Vice President irrelevant as future events would prove them wrong. The APC chieftain disclosed that President Buhari might also be in the know of the current developments. “Mr President might want to assist Osinbajo so that he is not tied down unnecessarily in Aso Rock. It would be stupid for anyone to think that Osinbajo would not aspire to be the President. And if he wants to run, he needs more time to move around. Once they relieve him of some tasks, I think he would have the time to attend to his matter. “One bitter truth our Vice President, Professor Osinbajo is that this man enjoys wider acceptability among Nigerians. We all know that President Buhari is serving out his second term mandate by 2023. And the wish of every politician is to aspire to a higher position of responsibility. So if Osinbajo is nursing that ambition to succeed Buhari, I don’t think it is a crime”

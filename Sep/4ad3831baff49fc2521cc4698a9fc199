Prime Minister Boris Johnson headed for the United Nations in New York on Sunday to argue that post-Brexit Britain will be a dynamic world power taking the lead on tackling climate change and an unstable Middle East. But he and his country face some big hurdles. He is struggling to strike a withdrawal agreement with a skeptical European Union, and a looming verdict from Britain’s Supreme Court could derail his Brexit plans. Johnson is likely to be dogged by Brexit throughout his three-day trip to the General Assembly, the U.N.’s annual gathering of world leaders. More than three years after Britain voted to leave the EU, the departure date has been postponed twice, and the U.K. Parliament has repeatedly rejected the only divorce deal offered. The country is facing a chaotic exit on Oct. 31 unless Johnson’s government can, against the odds, secure a new agreement.

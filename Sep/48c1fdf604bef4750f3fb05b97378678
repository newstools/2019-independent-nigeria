German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron are among those due to appear, NAN reports. However, the U.S.  President, Donald Trump is notably absent from the speakers’ list, instead, he was set to take part in an event on religious freedom on Monday. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told political and business leaders to bring plans, not speeches to the event, and encouraged pledges to abandon fossil fuels and slow the rise in global temperatures. Greta Thunberg, who has inspired a global student-led movement demanding policymakers implement concrete solutions to curb climate change, will take part in a youth dialogue with Guterres and other young activists.

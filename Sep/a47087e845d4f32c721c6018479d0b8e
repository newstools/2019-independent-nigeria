Real Madrid striker Luka Jovic is looking to make an impression in his first season with the club, but he has unfortunately picked up an ‘unknown’ injury over the international break. According to an official statement from the Serbian national team, striker Jovic picked up an ‘unknown’ injury. Serbia says that the injury occurred during the team’s 4-2 loss to Portugal in a European Championships qualifier, though Jovic only entered the game in the 87th minute as a substitute. Per Serbia, Jovic’s injury is a “relapse” of an ailment from before the international break.

Meanwhile, Real fans will have to monitor yet another injury to start the season. Jovic has played in all three games this season, and while he’s mostly come on as a substitute, he did log 68 minutes in Real’s 2-2 draw against Villarreal. The former Eintracht Frankfurt star hasn’t blossomed yet, but he did show off his technique by providing a back-heel pass in the build-up to one of Gareth Bale’s goals.

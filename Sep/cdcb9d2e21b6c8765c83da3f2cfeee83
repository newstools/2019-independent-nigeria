Africa’s second fastest man Divine Oduduru and Blessing Okagbare-Ighoteguenor opted out of the 100m race to focus on the 200m, the Athletics Federation of Nigeria said via it’s twitter handle. “Both athletes have decided to rather focus on the 200m and relay events. Contrary to speculations none of the athletes is injured.” Oduduru’s Personal Best of 9.85 this season is few seconds shy of Olusoji Fasuba’s 9.86, who is Africa’s fastest man since 2006. The World Championships began on Friday and ends on Oct. 6.

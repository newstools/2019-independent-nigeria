ABUJA – The Acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ibrahim Magu has said, the Commission will facilitate the quick return of proceeds of crime to their lawful owners to save it from suspicion by members of the public. This was as he also solicited the support of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), in the fight against corruption, noting that the apex bank’s strategic position in the financial sector makes it a necessary ally in the quest to rid Nigeria of all economic and financial crimes.

A press statement signed by the Head of Media and Publicity, Wilson Uwujaren and made available to Daily Independent stated; “The TSA makes it difficult to release recovered funds on bond as drafts raised often expire or funds cannot be released to the individual account.” He added, “Something would be done to facilitate the quick return of proceeds of crime to their lawful owners to save EFCC the suspicion by members of the public, who might not appreciate these administrative bottlenecks.”

Henrikh Mkhitaryan is close to sealing a move away from Arsenal, with Roma in talks with the London club over a season long loan deal for the Armenia midfielder, sources have told ESPN FC. Mkhitaryan, 30, came off the bench during Sundayâ€™s 2-2 draw with Tottenham at the Emirates, but it could turn out to be his final contribution in an Arsenal shirt if he completes the move to Roma. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Having signed from Manchester United in a swap deal with Alexis Sanchez in January 2018, Mkhitaryan has struggled to make an impact at the Emirates under Arsene Wenger or his successor, Unai Emery. Emery has made it clear to the former Borussia Dortmund player that he does not figure in his plans this season and Mkhitaryan is now prepared to follow former Old Trafford teammate Chris Smalling to Rome on loan. Sources have told ESPN FC that Roma have not secured an option to buy at the end of the season, but Mkhitaryan is likely to be made available for sale once the loan expires.

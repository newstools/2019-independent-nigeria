Roy Hodgson said his Crystal Palace side did not need to “apologise” for their 1-0 Premier League win over 10-man Aston Villa, after the visitors had a late equaliser controversially ruled out. Jordan Ayew’s instinctive finish ultimately decided the match at Selhurst Park, but Villa were incensed as Henri Lansbury’s added-time effort was disallowed for what referee Kevin Friend judged to be a dive by Jack Grealish in the build-up. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network “It’s unfortunate in some ways for us that it’s all going to centre around the controversy at the end,” said Hodgson, whose side are up to fourth in the formative Premier League league table after back-to-back wins. “Lucky for us the referee had made his decision before the ball had gone in the net and that was to give the free-kick,” he added. “I don’t think we need to apologise at all for the fact that we won the game.” Villa manager Dean Smith admitted he was bemused by the decision to deny his side a point, but accepted they would “take it on the chin”.

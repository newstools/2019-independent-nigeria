Beijing, China – Curtain will be drawn this evening on the 2019 FIBA World Cup when Spain takes on Argentina in the final game at the magnificent Cadillac Arena, Wukesong Sport Arena in Beijing, China. To reach the final, Spain eliminated Australia in their first semifinal while Argentina edged out France. Both games were played on Friday. However, the question is can Spanish defence stop the Argentine offence? Spain, winner of the 2006 edition in Japan, has won five of their previous seven World Cup meetings against inaugural winners in 1950, Argentina. Spain’s defence has limited their opponent in the tournament to 69.2 points per game, while Argentina has scored 87.6 points per game in China. Coach Sergio Scariolo has done outstanding defensive job in this event. Just for comparison, Spain held opponents to 66.5 points per game when they won the cup in Japan in 2006. The teams reached the final without a loss. However, 39-year-old Luis Scola is the main man for Argentina. Point Guard Facundo Campazzo, averaging 13.6 points and 7.7 assists per game, is the man running Argentina offence. If he can breakdown Spain’s defence, then they have a game in their hands. There is also Nicolas Laprovittola, who has been sharing the ball and this will be key against Spain. Spain’s Point Guard Ricky Rubio is also the brain behind their success. His average of 15.9 points and 6.4 assists per game has proved that he’s playing his best basketball. He has been taking 4.1 three-pointers per game in China and connecting on a 37.9 clip. Meanwhile, Australia and France will look to bounce back after their semifinal defeats in the third-place game at 4.00pm in China but 9.00am in Nigeria. The final will tip off 8.00pm in China but it will be 1.00pm in Nigeria. In the two classification games on Saturday USA beat Poland 87-74 to place 7th while Poland takes 8th position. Serbia also beat Czech Republic 90-81 to place fifth while Czech places 6th.

Manchester City’s defence has been heavily criticised by former England star turned pundit Alan Shearer after the club’s first defeat of the 2019/20 Premier League season at Norwich City. The Blues only dropped points of the campaign prior to Saturday’s visit to Carrow Road courtesy of a controversial VAR decision which cost Pep Guardiola ‘s men a win at home to Tottenham. But this time around it was less about bad luck for City and more about Norwich exposing some poor defending from the visitors, as the Canaries pulled off a shock 3-2 victory over the reigning champions. City were without Aymeric Laporte for the clash at Norwich after it was revealed he will be out of action until at least January thanks to a knee injury. The Blues looked less assured at the back without the 25-year-old and this has led to criticism aplenty from pundits. Shearer arguably provided the most stinging thoughts when he assessed the defeat on Match of the Day last night. “It was an absolute horror show defensively,” Shearer told the BBC. “Starting with a set-piece again, zonal marking, (Kenny) McLean has a run at them from the edge of the box. Rodri, (Raheem) Sterling, (Kyle) Walker, their position is all wrong; they don’t know he’s coming in there and not one person attacks it. They don’t move. McLean has run from the edge of the area and before Rodri moves, it’s too late.

BENIN – The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate for the Oredo West Constituency in the Edo State House of Assembly election, Eghosa Agbonifo, has asked that the seat of Hon. Chris Okaeben, representing the constituency, be declared vacant. Agbonifo who made this call while addressing newsmen in Benin City, argued that, 90 days after the inauguration of the Assembly, the lawmaker has refused to represent the constituents. He noted that it was quite disheartening that after 90 days since the election was conducted, the representative of Oredo West constituency was yet to resume sitting and move motions that will enhance development in the constituency. According to him, “It is Ninety days already, and the state house of assembly, though controversial, is without a representative from Oredo-West. “If a day is a long-time in politics, what would we then say of the ninety good days that Oredo-West had been without a voice for the people? This is absolutely unacceptable! With the myriads of needs in the constituency, we cannot afford to have a vacuum. “I therefore request that the current house and her leadership declare the seat vacant if that would be the solution in filling our position. “The All Progressive Congress, the State Governor, and Christopher Okaeben, cannot hold the constituency to ransom”, he said. The PDP candidate also called on the state government to do the needful if the state house of assembly is illegally constituted. “The good people of Oredo-West in unambiguous terms, refused to be sidelined in the politics and governance of the state,” he said.

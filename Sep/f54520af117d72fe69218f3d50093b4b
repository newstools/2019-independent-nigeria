The Edo State Government has said it has over 10,600ha of land under cultivation in different parts of the state under its agricultural programmes benefitting over 2000 farmers distributed in the different farms in the three senatorial districts of the state. The State Government embarked on a multi-faceted agricultural development scheme backed by the Nigeria Incentive-Based Risk Sharing System for Agricultural Lending (NIRSAL), Elephant Group, and a number of other off-takers. The priority crops include cassava, maize, rice, which are being cultivated in different locations across the state, including Ilushi, Iguoriakhi, Sobe, Warake, Iguomon, Agenebode, Usugbenu and Ekpoma. Mr. Crusoe Osagie, Special Adviser to the Governor on Media and Communication Strategy, in a statement, said that the state had more than 10,600 hectares of land under cultivation in different parts of the state. He added that the state government engaged in land-clearing to ensure that the cost is not borne by the farmers, noting that mechanised farming was being deployed to ensure that planting process is not so tedious.

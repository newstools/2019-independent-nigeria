ABUJA – The Minister of State, Budget and National Planning, Prince Clem Ikanade Agba has underscored the need for co-ordination of the activities of development partners in Nigeria, saying “it will now be compulsory in order to achieve Aid effectiveness and efficiency”. Agba gave this indication during his welcome remarks at the High-Level Round table meeting on National Donor Coordination held at the Conference hall of the Ministry of Finance, Abuja. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network A statement on Wednesday by Mrs. Victoria Agba-Attah, Director, Information, in the Ministry of Budget and National Planning quoted the minister as saying “It is imperative that we establish an agreeable process for the coordination and effective management of development assistance in the country. “Our mission is to be at par with international best practices and to achieve a mutual understanding and cooperation with a flexible framework of guidelines”. He added that donors need the guidance and direction from government to ensure that resources are beneficial to the populace, and stressed the need to monitor the performance of all international commitments in order to avoid duplication of efforts and ensure even distribution of resources across the country. To this end, the Minister revealed that the ministry was already finalising the Official Development Assistance (ODA) Policy which seeks to maximise the benefit of international assistance and ensures alignment with national priorities. He, therefore, called on donors and partners to update their reports in the Development Assistant Database (DAD) system domiciled in the Ministry and also channel all their interventions through the Ministry which is the country’s gateway to development assistance.

DAMATURU – Action Against Hunger (AAH),has trained community leaders, religious leaders, civil society organizations (CSOs), ward development committees (WDCs) and the media on the need to tackle malnutrition in Yobe and Jigawa states. In his opening remarks, Idris Abdulsalam, Yobe State Project Manager AAH and Working to Improve Nutrition in Northern Nigeria (WINNN) funded by Department of International Developmemt (DFID), explained that the training of the actors on nutrition became necessary on order to free the affected areas from the shackles of malnutrition . According to him ,Yobe and Jigawa states are among the states facing the challenges of malnutrition,adding:”That is why we engaged the stakeholders in the training on how to get rid of the problem.The Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (NHDS) survey 2018 indicators report shows that thirty-seven percent of children in Nigeria are stunted (below -2 SD), and 19% are severely stunted (below -3 SD). “Stunting generally increases with age, peaking at 47% among children age 24-35 months. A higher proportion of children in rural areas (46%) than urban areas (27%) are stunted. Similarly, children in the North West (60%) are more likely to be stunted than other children. Stunting is relatively high among children in Kebbi (68%), Jigawa (68%), and Yobe (65%). Children of women with no education are more likely to be stunted than those whose mothers have been to school. Stunting is inversely related to wealth quintile; 58% of children in the lowest wealth quintile are stunted, as compared with 16% of children in the highest quintile”.

ONITSHA – The Nigerian Navy has continues to mount surveillance in several riverine communities in Ogbaru and Omambala axis which are mainly agrarian areas of Anambra State. Navy Captain Ali Abdu, Commander, Odekpe Naval Outpost, who disclosed this in a telephone interview, charged traditional rulers, Presidents-General and other influential people in the communities to work as a body towards ensuring that relative peace and security of lives and properties of the people were not jeopardised. Captain Abdu said that criminal activities that usually took place in the communities had been reduced drastically due to frequent patrol of Naval personnel along the River Niger water ways, which were formally an easy route for criminals who operated from the water to attack the villagers and escaped through the River Niger by speed boat. He, however, cautioned villagers and residents of the area to be conscious of movement of strangers in their midst as some of the criminals sometimes spy on their potential victims and targets before embarking on their nefarious activities. “Traditional rulers, Presidents-General and other well meaning people in the villages should as a matter of importance form a synergy in order to nip in the bud all intentions of crime commission in their locality. “To guarantee effective policing of these riverine communities, all the villagers should also co-operate with one another and report any suspected movement or people of questionable character to law enforcement agents,” he stated. Abdu, while commending the cooperation and cordial relationship existing between the Navy, the host community, Odekpe, and other neighbouring communities in the area also called for improved collaborative effort among the community leaders and other security agencies in the area. He added that Ogbaru would continue be hell for criminals as the Nigerian Navy would intensify road patrol between Uga junction stretching to interior communities of Ogwuikpele, Osommala and other places along the coastal boundaries of Anambra, Delta and Rivers states.

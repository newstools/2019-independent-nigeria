LAGOS – Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr has hinted that his side would have won Tuesday’s night’s international friendly against Ukraine had the game been played on neutral ground. In his post-match comments, Rohr acknowledged that it was a game of two halves, in which he admitted that Ukraine played better in the second half, but insinuated that they relied on home advantage to pull back and settle for a 2-2 draw. ”A wonderful test match. Both opponents demonstrated high-quality football. We won the first half, but Ukraine played at home, so the result is logical. After the break, the opponent did much better”, he said. The Franco-German tactician, however, praised his lads for working hard, especially in the first half, but admitted that the Ukrainians stepped up their efforts after half time and truly deserved the final scoreline they eked out. The Super Eagles led 2-0 going into the break, courtesy an opening goal by debuting Glasgow Rangers of Scotland midfielder, Joe Aribo and the second with a penalty from Lille Metropole of France striker, Victor Osimhen. However, coach Andriy Shevchenko’s side romped back to pull level in the 78th minute, thanks to a stunner by Manchester City midfielder, Oleksandr Zinchenko and Roman Yaremchuk then pulled them level with a controversially awarded equalizer 60 seconds later. Meanwhile, Osimhen has dedicated his first ever goal for the Super Eagles to God, as the youngster hinted that he was able to convert a penalty against Ukraine due to divine guidance. Although he could not net from open play, relying on a spot kick won by Samuel Kalu to make hay, Osimhen admitted it was a great way to open his scoring haul with the Nigerian senior national team. Osimhen excitedly took to social media afterwards, with plaudits for his teammates, aspirations for the Super Eagles’ future and thanks to God for making his goal possible, as he posted: ”Good team performance. GOD is the greatest. We move.

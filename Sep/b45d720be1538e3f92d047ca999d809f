The British prime minister has insisted that talks with the EU on a revised Brexit deal were “making substantial progress.” But the bloc says the UK has not submitted any substantial new proposals. European Commission spokeswoman, Mina Andreeva, told reporters in Brussels that “there is nothing new” from London. She also said that the EU was open to a deal, but was also carrying on with no-deal preparations. “There may be twists and turns in political developments in London right now, but our position is stable. We are willing to work constructively with Prime Minister Boris Johnson and to look at any proposals that he may have as long as they are compatible with the withdrawal agreement,” she said. Johnson’s attempt to get the UK out of the EU by October 31, “no ifs or buts,” stood in tatters after rebellious lawmakers on Wednesday night blocked his plan to leave the EU next month without a withdrawal deal and rejected his call to trigger a snap general election. He also now leads a government with no parliamentary majority. But some in the EU have said the deal on the table is as good of a compromise as will be reached. “The deal we are having now, which was made last year, it is difficult to think of an alternative to it. And it is a good compromise, and a compromise towards the British position more than to the European position,” German lawmaker Metin Hakverdi told DW

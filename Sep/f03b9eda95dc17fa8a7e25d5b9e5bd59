LAGOS – Dr. Abimbola Ogunkelu, a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and former Minister for Cooperation and Integration in Africa has accused government of working at variance with the provisions of the constitution.
According to him, the hasty decision of the government in collaboration with the court leading to the proscription of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN), popularly known as Shiites was suspicious.
Ogunkelu in a chat with Daily Independent on Sunday said that as the group planned to hold its annual procession on Tuesday, it would be necessary for the government to understand that members of the group as Nigerians deserved to have freedom of worship as enshrined in the constitution.
He said that Nigerians have found it difficult to understand the haste with which the Islamic group was proscribed and termed a terrorist group, saying that they e remained citizens of the country with every right for worship and association bestowed on them by the constitution. Ogunkelu maintained that in the interest of peace the government should allow them to enjoy the freedom of worship just like other citizens. When asked if he envisaged any violence today as members of the group had h dared the police to stay away from its peaceful procession he said, “The truth is that Nigerians don’t understand the rivalry between the Sunnis and the Shiites.
“We don’t know the hasty reason for the proscription of the Shiite group. They have a right to worship and association as citizens. Maybe some of us don’t understand it because we are not of the Muslim sect but I don’t think they deserved to be called a terrorist group; they are Nigerians. This government is not working in the spirit of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,” he said.

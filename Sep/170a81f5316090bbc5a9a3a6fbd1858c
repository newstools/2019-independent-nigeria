The Lagos State Environmental and Special Offences Enforcement Unit, early Friday morning, conducted a raid on an illegal brothel in the Mile Two area of the state and arrested five notorious miscreants and nine sex workers with illegal drugs. Rationalising the surprise dawn raid, CSP Olayinka Egbeyemi, Chairman of the agency stated that it became imperative following complaints that criminal activities around Mile Two towards Festac were being perpetrated by miscreants who reside in the illegal brothel. Egbeyemi disclosed that the brothel had previously been demolished by the Agency during the clearing of illegal structures, shanties and containerised shops from Eric Moore Road down to Trade Fair axis. “It was disheartening seeing that the demolished brothel had been re-built by the owner after it was demolished for illegal construction on road setbacks. The last time we demolished the illegal brothel, those miscreants taking refuge there at night attacked our officers with dangerous weapons”, Egbeyemi disclosed. He further explained that the brothel is noted for harbouring criminals who rob unsuspecting members of the public of their valuables and also serves as an outlet for the sale of illegal drugs such Indian hemp, Tramadol and other sex enhancement drugs, especially to underaged children. The Egbeyemi insisted that the Sanwo-Olu administration would not fold its arms and allow miscreants to continue making life difficult for law-abiding citizens of the state even as he confirmed that the illegal brothel had been demolished this morning by the Agency. According to Egbeyemi, all those arrested will be charged to court in compliance with the directive of the Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Mr. Zubairu Muazu.

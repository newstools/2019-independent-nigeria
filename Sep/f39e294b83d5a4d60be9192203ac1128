Abuja â€“ The House of Representatives is considering a resolution aimed at urging the Federal government to provide bailout funds to all moribund factories across the country. The House in a motion on matters of urgent public importance brought by Hon. James Abiodun Faleke (APC, Lagos) is calling for the revival of all dead industries as a means of creating job opportunities for the teeming youths. Collapsed industries such as the Ajaokuta Steel Complex in Kogi state, the Textile industry in Kaduna and other parts of the country, as well as vehicle assembly plants are to be revived via the proposed bailout funds to be administered by the Bank of Industry.

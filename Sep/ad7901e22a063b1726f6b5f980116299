MINNA – Critical Stakeholders Meeting on the State of Affairs in Niger State has made a case for a State of Emergency in critical infrastructure including education, security, flooding and general underdevelopment that have bedeviled the state in recent years. Despite obtaining $6 million grant to improve the education sector by the Governor Abubarkar Sani Bello- led administration, the stakeholders lamented the deteriorating situation in primary schools whereby most of the schools lacked teaching staff. The National Examination Council (NECO) withheld the May/June Senior Secondary Certificate Examination (SSCE) results for candidates of Niger State origin after the results were released a on August 27, 2019 because the state government had not been able to pay outstanding N320 million debt. The Etsu Nupe and chairman Niger State Council of Traditional Rulers, Alhaji Yahaya Abubarkar, and the former Minister of State for Niger Delta Affairs, Hajiya Zaynab Kutchi, who were among the stakeholders, expressed worries over infrastructural decay in Niger State. Kutchi was particularly worried that the education sector and road network were in their worst state, as some communities were simply cut off while some roads had become death traps such that cars can no longer ply them thereby discouraging people from visiting their communities.

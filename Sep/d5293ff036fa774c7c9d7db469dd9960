LAGOS – The Association of National Accountants of Nigeria (ANAN) said on Thursday that it has decided to embark on assessment of Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) for public sector accountability, just as about 5,000 members of the association participated in the annual ‘ANAN Walk for Nation Building’ in Abuja. Leading members of the association during the walk, ANAN president, Professor Muhammad Mainoma, said the association had constituted a seven-man committee to assess the MDAs for accountability. Mainoma said the theme of the 24th Annual Conference of the association closing on Thursday was ‘Nation Building and Sustainable Growth: Challenges and Prospects’. He recalled that ANAN started the concept of ’Whistle Blowing’ several years ago, saying that the association discovered that it must now put a system in place to monitor and assess MDAs. According to him, we have set up a committee to rank MDAs in order of performance in a bid to check corruption. “We want individuals to run away from corruption. Ours is to develop a nation where corruption will not happen. The kind of mechanism we are developing in our association is Controlled mechanism. No single individual should be in a place to start a project and complete it. Other people must be involved to avoid connivance,’’ Mainoma said. “To do nation building, bench marking is very essential and this is a basic pillar of the ANAN conference. You cannot build a nation if you do not have love for the nation. “You require a lot in terms of organisation. You require some level of capacity building. Knowledge is essential if you are talking about nation building. There must be some level of sincerity of purpose. Nation building is something all hands must be on deck.

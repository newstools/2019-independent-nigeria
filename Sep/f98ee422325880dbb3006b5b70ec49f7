The operatives of the Lagos State Environmental and Special Offences Enforcement Unit (Taskforce) in the early hours of yesterday arrested five notorious miscreants and nine prostitutes with illegal drugs in a brothel around Mile 2 area of Lagos.
Making this known yesterday was the Chairman of the Agency, Chief Superintendent of Police, Olayinka Egbeyemi who said the raid became imperative following complaints that criminal activities around Mile 2 towards FESTAC were perpetrated by miscreants who reside in the illegal brothel.
Egbeyemi disclosed that the brothel had previously been demolished by the agency during the clearing of illegal structures, shanties and container used as shops from Eric Moore Road down to Trade Fair axis.
“It was disheartening seeing that the demolished brothel had been re-built by the owner after it was demolished for illegal construction on road setbacks. The last time we demolished the illegal brothel, those miscreants taking refuge there at night attacked our officers with dangerous weapons,” Egbeyemi disclosed.
He stated further that the brothel is noted for harbouring criminals who rob unsuspecting members of the public of their valuables and also serves as an outlet for the sale of illegal drugs such as Indian hemp, Tramadol and other sex enhancement drugs, especially to underage children.
The Taskforce Chairman maintained that the present administration would not fold its arms and allow miscreants to make life difficult for law-abiding citizens.
He confirmed that the illegal brothel was again demolished yesterday by the Agency, while assuring members of the public that the agency and other security agencies will not rest on their oars to endure that sanity is installed in the state.
Egbeyemi declared that all those arrested would be charged to court in compliance with the directive of the Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Mr. Zubairu Muazu.

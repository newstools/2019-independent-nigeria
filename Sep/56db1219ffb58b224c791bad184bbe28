Jurgen Klopp has revealed what Mohamed Salah said about Sadio Mane ahead of signing for Liverpool in 2017. The Egyptian, who arrived from Roma for £43million, expressed concerns over what position he would take up on his Premier League return – with Mane having operated on the right for much of the 2016/17 campaign. Salah, who had a scintillating first season at Anfield scoring 44 goals from the right, did worry where his team-mate would play. Speaking to Sky Sports, Klopp said: “It’s incredible how they’ve developed together. “The boys are brilliant characters – different but brilliant – but of course we signed (Salah and Mane) because they obviously had outstanding skills. “I remember when we spoke to Mo the first time, he said: ‘Yes, but Sadio is playing on the right wing and he’s not bad is he?’ “And I said: ‘I know, but he can play on the other wing as well.’ “It was clear it wasn’t just one pushing the other – they could play together. They’re a proper threat. Jurgen Klopp during the Premier League match between Chelsea FC and Liverpool FC at Stamford Bridge on September 22, 2019
Analysis – Klopp’s anger with Firmino “It just works, with Bobby [Firmino] as the connector. Different games can mean different line-ups of course but to have these three in this shape is nice.” The duo, who featured during Liverpool’s 2-1 win over Chelsea on Sunday, were crowned top scorers in the Premier League last season along with Arsenal’s Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Salah and Mane have both netted four times each so far this term, with the Reds currently sitting five points clear of Manchester City in pole position of England’s top flight.

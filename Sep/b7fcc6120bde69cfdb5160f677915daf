Hundreds of people protested on Monday in front of a Moroccan court as the trial opened of a journalist accused of having a late-term abortion and sexual relations outside marriage. The case brought against Hajar Raissouni, who writes for the Arabic daily Akhbar Al-Yaoum, has triggered a furious debate in the media and online about civil liberties and freedom of the press in the North African country. Protesters shouted “freedom for Hajar” and “our society is in danger” and brandished placards urging “My body, my freedom” and “No to the criminalisation of sex between consenting adults”. The 28-year-old, whose newspaper has a history of run-ins with authorities, risks up to two years in prison if found guilty under the penal code, which bars sex before marriage and abortion – except if the mother’s life is in danger. Raissouni was arrested on August 31 as she left a clinic in the capital, Rabat, where her lawyer Saad Sahli said she had been undergoing treatment for internal bleeding. In a statement, it stressed her detention had “nothing to do with her profession as a journalist”.

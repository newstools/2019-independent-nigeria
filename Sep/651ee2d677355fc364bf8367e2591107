Ahead of the November Governorship election in Kogi State, Mr Umar Bamaiyi of the All Blending Party (ABP) says he has no plan to step down for any candidate contesting the election. Bamaiyi stated this in a statement made available in Lagos. According to Bamaiyi, he was not intimidated by the moneybag politicians and as such would not jettison his governorship ambition to support a PDP candidate as reported by some sections of the media. The governorship hopeful said that the mandate which he was pursuing was sacrosanct to the development of the state, therefore, adoption of a consensus candidate by him was untrue. He said there was no plan or any arrangement for him to step down for any candidate, advising that such report should be disregarded. “I have a passion to fix Kogi, which has been there since I was younger. I am working on how this state can achieve the desired greatness. “I am propelled by the appalling situation of this state that in spite of its abundance, we are yet to achieve anything; the older generation has failed the state.”

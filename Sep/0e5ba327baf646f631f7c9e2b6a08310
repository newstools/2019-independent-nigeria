India’s continued crackdown in Kashmir is “pushing more people into extremism”, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan has warned. Speaking at a rally in Muzaffarabad, capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, on Friday, Khan added that he would present Kashmir’s case at the United Nations General Assembly in New York next week, ACCORDING TO Aljazeera. “When atrocities reach their peak, people would prefer that death is better than this insulting life,” Khan said at a rally attended by several thousand people. “The Kashmir issue today is a humanitarian problem. “I want to tell India that, by detaining thousands of people, you are pushing people into extremism. People will rise against India, and it is not just about Indian Muslims. There are 1.25 billion Muslims around the world. They all are watching this.”

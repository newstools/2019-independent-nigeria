Lagos – Rangers International Club of Enugu, Nigeria’s sole campaigners in the CAF Confederation Cup, suffered a slim 1-2 loss to their Gabonese hosts, AS Pelican, on Sunday in the first round of the second-tier club competition. The Flying Antelopes started brightly in the game, which was played inside the main bowl of Stade Jean Koumou, Lambaréné, Gabon. However, the hosts raced to a 2-0 lead but Rangers have Nnamdi Egbujor to thank for reducing the deficit. The result leaves the former Nigerian champions with no option than to beat the Gabonese in Enugu in a fortnight. The Antelopes must defeat AS Pelican with a margin of more than one goal to stand the chance of progressing to the pre-group stage. A 2-1 win for Rangers will take the game to a penalty shootout while a 1-0 win for the Enugu side would see them progress on the strength of their away goal. However, in a chat with SUNDAY INDEPENDENT, Norbert Okolie, the club’s media officer, assured that the Oriental team has what it takes to clip the wings of AS Pelican, assuring that they would fly over them in the return leg and progress to the next round.

ABUJA – The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Friday raised the alarm over the undue delay by the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal to release the record of its record of Judgment. The party said that the record of the judgment would enable its Presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, to promptly file an appeal to upturn the judgment at the Supreme Court. A statement by its spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan said, “our party and millions of supporters across the country believe that the delay is a calculated attempt by some quarters to frustrate our appeal at the Supreme Court, where Nigerians have expressed confidence to get justice as well as restore the integrity of our judiciary, which has been eroded by the Tribunal. “It is instructive to state that the Court of Appeal is aware that our party and candidate have mandatory 14 days to appeal to the Supreme Court, yet it is delaying in releasing a judgment that was read for nine hours and which it wants the public to believe it actually wrote. “Our party fears that this development is lending credence to suspicion in the public space that the judgment is being tampered with and altered, in the name of correcting errors, knowing that there is no way the verdicts can stand the scrutiny of the Supreme Court.

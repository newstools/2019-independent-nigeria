A research by Nexford University shows that over 30 million job vacancies are available for Nigerians. Dr. Robin Johnston, vice president of Academic Innovation at the university, made this known at Nexford’s open day in Lagos. The open day was part of the university’s continued efforts to equip learners with skills and competences that would make them relevant in the workplace. The event, which held in Lagos, featured CV reviews, applications and onsight admissions as well as learning from career specialists and subject matter experts on business management and entrepreneurship. Johnston explained that the event was organised to bring together entrepreneurs and individuals in Nigeria to focus on qualitative education and the connection between the workplace and education. She said: “With this, we are addressing the needs of small businesses/startups. We will provide access to where employment is and where the jobs are in the future. “We are working with employers and there is a connection between the workforces. Our model is the workplace alignment model; looking at people’s need now and in the future not only in transferable skills which means communication, critical thinking, problem-solving, but also in skills for the future. “The institution researched over 30 million job vacancies as part of its model. It does not use textbooks, but relies on relevant information from business fields.”

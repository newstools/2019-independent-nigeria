Greece said on Saturday it would step up border patrols and move asylum-seekers on its islands to the mainland in an effort to deal with a resurgence in migrant flows from neighbouring Turkey.

Arrivals – mostly of Afghan families – have picked up over the summer, and August marked the highest number of monthly arrivals in three years. Greece’s Moria camp on the island of Lesbos – a sprawling facility where conditions have been described by aid organizations as inhumane – is also holding the highest number of people since the deal was agreed.

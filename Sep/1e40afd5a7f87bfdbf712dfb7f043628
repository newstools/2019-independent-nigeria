LAGOS – Adekunle Jasper, a member of Nigeria 4x100m relay team who won gold at the just concluded 2019 African Games (AG) in Morocco has called on government, groups and individuals for financial support ahead of the forthcoming World Athletic Championship in Doha, Qatar. Jasper made the call on Tuesday as guest in a television sport programme in Lagos while dwelling on her preparations for the Doha meet, adding she was still to commence any positive preparations. “I want to be in Qatar for the World Athletic Championship, but the problem now is the money to commence proper training, because I have been doing things in my own way up till now. “But, if I can get assistance from the government, groups or individuals and train very well, I will do better than I have achieved so far and I can compete among the world beats,” she said. Other sports technocrats who commented believes that it was high time Nigeria looked inward and take advantage of local athletes that are making progress, rather than depending on foreign athletes. The 2019 IAAF World Athletics Championships, the 17th edition, is scheduled to hold from September 27 to October 6 in Doha at the multi-purpose Khalifa International Stadium. Jasper ahead of the AG won the women’s 100m B Final at the 2nd Making of Champions (MoC) Grand Prix in Lagos. Jasper was in the quartet of Joy Udo-Gabriel, Mercy Ntia-Obong and Rosemary Chukwuma winning event in 44.16secs for Nigeria despite the withdrawal of Okagbare from the event at the last minute in Morocco.

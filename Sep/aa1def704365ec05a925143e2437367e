DAMATURU – Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State has approved the automatic employment into the state civil service of 37 midwives of set 2 of the Shehu Sule College of Nursing and Midwifery, Damaturu. The governor also approved a review of the monthly allowances of student-nurses and midwives of the college by 100 percent. He announced this in a speech at the graduation ceremony of the 37 midwives at the campus of the college in Damaturu on Thursday. The governor advised the graduating midwives to be guided by their code of practice and the lessons they learnt at the college, saying the state’s healthcare sector needed their services. “As you step out of this institution to join our healthcare workforce, I want all of you to remember the lessons you have learnt here – that as midwives, your job would be critical to saving lives, preventing maternal and child mortality and improving the health of women and children across the state. “You should, therefore, do your jobs with professionalism and with patience because our healthcare system needs you,” he said. Buni also revealed that a two-storey-200-bed capacity hostel and two additional classrooms and offices would be built for students of the Shehu Sule College. He also said that of the 3,600 housing units to be built in the state soon, some would be allocated to the staff of the institution to address their accommodation problems. He assured that the state government would continue to ensure free maternal and child healthcare, regular supply of drugs and consumables to hospitals and will support all the primary healthcare facilities in the state.

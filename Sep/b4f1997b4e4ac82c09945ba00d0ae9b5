Ogun State Government says it has zero tolerance for rape, physical assault of the minors and the vulnerable groups within the State. The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development, Dr. Ranti Oladeinde made this known at the quarterly meeting of the State Sexual Gender-Based Violence Response Network, held at Upright Hotel, Agbeloba, Abeokuta. Dr. Oladeinde, represented by the Director, Child Development Services, Mr. Kehinde Egbeolowo, restated governmentâ€™s commitment to build a just society, devoid of gender based violence, urging stakeholders to work as a team in the enforcement of laws, to stem the menace. While delivering her paper, the Programme Coordinator, Mrs. Kassim Wonuola, advised stakeholders to make referral when necessary, while handling cases of violence, adding that victims might require help that was beyond the expertise or scope of work of the current service provider. She stated that lack of support system for victims of rape and assault, especially in cases when the abusers were the financier of the victims, forced such victims to be silent, emphasising resettlement of victims. Stakeholders at the event included the Nigerian Police, Vigilante Services, Ministry of Justice, National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, Health providers, Social Workers among others.

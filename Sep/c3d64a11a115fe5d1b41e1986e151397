The Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) has adopted Yahaya Bello as its candidate for the forthcoming Nov. 16 governorship election in Kogi state. The National Organising Secretary of the group, Alhaji Aliyu Saleh, who made the declaration at a news conference in Lokoja, on Saturday, directed Fulanis in the state to immediately embark on Ruga-to-Ruga campaign for the re-election of Bello. Saleh said that the group decided to support the governor for providing a secure environment for Fulanis to operate in the state. “We are also supporting the governor for approving free Contagious Bovine Plurol Pheneumonia (CBPP) vaccination for over 23, 000 cows belonging to our members in the state,” he said. The group also commended Bello for putting in place measures, which had led to a reduction in clashes between farmers and herders in the state.

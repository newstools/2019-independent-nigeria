The President of International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Peter Maurer, has stated that the ICRC partnered with Tony Elumelu, the Founder of Tony Elumelu Foundation to create economic opportunities in conflict prone regions in Africa. Maurer, who made the disclosure in a chat with international journalists at the weekend, however, called for a new private sector led approach to humanitarian development in Africa Collaboration between humanitarian and the private sector is critical for impact-driven intervention It would be recalled that at the just concluded Forum organised by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), key speakers Elumelu, Founder of the Tony Elumelu Foundation and Maurer, President of ICRC proffered entrepreneurship as the most sustainable solution to accelerating Africa’s transformation. During a one-on-one conversation at the event, both speakers called for a new private-sector-led approach to humanitarian development in Africa. While speaking at the Forum, Peter Maurer commended the Tony Elumelu Foundation’s private-sector-led approach as the gold standard of humanitarian development in Africa focused on impacting lives at scale and transforming the continent. Mr. Maurer said: “On one side, it is important that we assist and protect people when they are disrupted by violence and war. But what brought me together with Tony is not the white shirt and the blue suit, it is his deep conviction that with longer and protracted conflict we need to bring people much earlier into independence.” He added: “We need, more than ever, in the most fragile, violent parts of society to show the pathway to independence and to a dignified life and this goes with income-generating activities, productive activities, with small businesses. This is why we partnered with the Tony Elumelu Foundation”.

There are strong indications that leading telecoms company, MTN Nigeria, is planning to raise N100 billion through Commercial Paper (CP). According reports, although the telco giant is yet to officially announce the plan, an official suggested on at the weekend that the firm would issue the commercial paper through the Nigerian Stock Exchange shortly. The company also said that the issuance of commercial papers is merely just one of its other financing options, as stated in its introduction Memorandum when listing its shares on the Nigerian bourse. The release also revealed that the telco finances its expenditure through syndicated banking facilities which it will keep on doing in the future. It would be recalled that the Company in its statement on Tuesday said that in its Listing by Introduction Memorandum, it already indicated that in the past, MTN financed its expenditure through syndicated banking facilities but it would henceforth explore other financing opportunities, including the issuance of commercial papers. The company said it will announce the development through the Nigerian Stock Exchange at the appropriate time. “Shareholders are reminded to exercise caution when reacting to information which has not been released by the company,” the statement said. The development was made public by the Head, Frontier Research at EFG Hermes, Kato Mukuru which was unofficially disclosed at the time during an interview with CNBC. He also explained that the telco’s motive for moving in that direction is because it is cheaper than getting bank finances or probably the banks does not want to finance it.

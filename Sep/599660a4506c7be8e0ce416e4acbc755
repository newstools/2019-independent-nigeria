AKURE – President Muhammadu Buhari has been called upon to meet his South African counterpart, President Cyril Ramaphosa, to find a solution to the xenophobic attacks on Nigerians resident in South Africa. Pastor Adewale Giwa of Awaiting The Second Coming of Jesus gave the advice in a press statement made available to Daily Independent on Wednesday in Akure, Ondo State capital. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network He stated that rather than sending delegation to the South African president, President Buhari should meet with President Ramaphosa and fashion out lasting solution to the killings of Nigerians and destruction of their investments in South Africa. Pastor Giwa noted this would send a serious signal to the South African government that Nigerian government was bitter about the killings of her citizens. According to Pastor Giwa, “On the renewed xenophobia in South Africa, I call on President Buhari to personally meet with their president to solve the problem. This is getting out of hand, and sending delegates to the country will not and cannot proffer solutions to the ongoing attacks on Nigerians unless Buhari sees President Cyril Ramaphosa face to face.” He, however, blamed the influx of Nigerians to foreign countries on the poor handling of the nation’s economy by politicians since the return to democratic government since 1999. Giwa reasoned that if the nation’s economy had been positioned very well, there wouldn’t have been need for Nigerian to leave the country to seek greener pastures abroad.

Governor Okezie Ikpeazu at the weekend announced his government’s decision to establish the Ministry of Homeland Security in his second term. This, he explained, will curtail the incessant cases of kidnapping and other forms of crimes in the state. In statement he issued in Umuahia, signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Onyebuchi Omemenka, Ikpeazu disclosed that the need arose for the new ministry because of state government’s desire to nip in the bud cases of crimes, particularly the menace of Fulani herdsmen, which according to him, is becoming worrisome. The Abia governor stated that the state government would tie up loose ends in terms of securing the state borders, adding that the main focus of the ministry would include mainstreaming activities of the Fulani Herdsmen and other violent crimes with “a view of safeguarding our people and our environment”. His word: “The whole idea is to ensure that no inch of Abia territory will remain unpoliced,” even as he assured that field personnel of the ministry will be trained under the collaborative effort of the Nigeria Police. Ikpeazu disclosed that the name of the commissioner to head the new ministry was included in the list of commissioner-nominees now before the Abia State House of Assembly, stressing that the government would not allow the peace pervading the state to be disrupted by any individual or group under any guise.

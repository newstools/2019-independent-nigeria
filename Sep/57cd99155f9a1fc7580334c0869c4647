President Michel Aoun says Lebanon has a legitimate right to fight off any act of aggression threatening its territorial integrity, warning that the Israeli regime will bear all the consequences in such a case. Aoun also emphasized Lebanon’s adherence to UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which brokered a ceasefire in the war of aggression Israel launched against Lebanon in the summer 2006, Presstv reports. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The Lebanese president pointed to the recent Israeli drone strikes on Beirut’s southern suburbs, saying the “rules of engagement” had been violated. He said the strikes flouted Resolution 1701. Aoun later hailed the efforts made by Kubis and the UN secretary general in addition to “brotherly and friendly countries for extending the mandate of the UNIFIL (United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon) forces operating in South Lebanon without modification in their tasks.” The Lebanese army, he said, is fully carrying out its duties regarding decisions made by the Beirut government and the Higher Defense Council. Kubis, for his part, briefed Aoun on the deliberations concerning the extension of UNIFIL’s term and the positions of the Security Council members, plus the role that UNIFIL played to maintain stability in the aftermath of recent events on the border between southern Lebanon and the Israeli occupied territories.

UGHELLI – The South-South zone of Indigenous Contractors Association of Nigeria has commended President Muhammadu Buhari on the appointment of Bernard Okumagba as the Managing Director of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) and Godswill Akpabio as Minister of Niger Delta Affairs. Chairman of South-South Contractors and Indigenous Contractors Association, Igho Egheba, who gave this commendation in Warri on Thursday, said President Buhari made a good choice in the appointment of Okumagba and Akpabio, adding that the duo would do a better job to spread developmental projects to all communities of the Niger Delta and the entire South-South. Egheba noted that President Buhari was meticulous in choosing capable persons to run the affairs of the NDDC and the Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs in order to accelerate the needed development in the South-South. He urged the people of South-South to give their maximum support to the newly constituted NDDC Board and Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs headed by Akpobio, affirming that Okumagba and Akpobio are competent and capable persons that would do a good job. Egheba disclosed that the NDDC and the Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs were established by the Federal Government to address the under-development of the region but that the past leadership of the commission and the ministry did not met the expectation of the people, adding that they were optimistic and confident in the abilities of the new leadership of the NDDC Board and the ministry.

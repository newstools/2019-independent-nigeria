ABUJA – Prince Adetokunbo Kayode, President, Abuja Chamber of Commerce and Industry(ACCI), has said the system of funding mechanism for the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) is defective and retrogressive to the SMEs in Nigeria. Speaking on Monday at the official opening of the 2019 Abuja International Trade Fair, Kayode said the Federal Government had about 21 intervention funds with billions of naira committed, but very minimum impact either in terms of quantum or quality. He observed that over the years, the Federal Government, especially through the Central Bank of Nigeria(CBN), had made very substantial funds available for SMEs, adding that the issues associated with the disbursement in terms of interest rates, collateral, and short term nature have contributed immensely to dwindle the marginal efforts to fund SMEs. He also posited that funding through the commercial banks has proved unproductive, adding that commercial banks are not programmed or structured to do long-term funding or capital investment. According to him, “Commercial banks are into short term, quick return deals. So, why do we continue to pass development funds through commercial banks, where experience has taught us that the essence and the aim of government is frustrated or thwarted?”

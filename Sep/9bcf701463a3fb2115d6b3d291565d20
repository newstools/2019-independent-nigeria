NRLA Commercial Director, Mr. Chiekezi Dozie expressed that “It’s an honor and a privilege to be linked with a pan African brand like Supersports in our first year of hosting these MEA Championships. We are hopeful that a brand association of this caliber can only spur us on to bigger and brighter accomplishments” . The MEA Rugby League Championship competition is to officially begin next month. The competition, the second MEA Championship will be held at the Teslim Balogun Stadium in Lagos, Nigeria. The tournament which will see Nigeria face Ghana on the first day is an opportunity for investors to invest in Africa’s most populous nation.

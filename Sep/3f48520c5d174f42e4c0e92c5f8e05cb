The streets of downtown Hong Kong turned into the site of clashes between protesters and police on Sunday as the political turmoil continues in the global financial center for a 15th straight weekend. Tens of thousands of pro-democracy supporters marched through downtown in defiance of a police ban before violence broke out later in the day as police fired chemical-laced blue water meant to mark protesters as well as tear gas at demonstrators who lobbed Molotov cocktails outside the Hong Kong government office complex, Fox news reports. Authorities had turned down a request by the Civil Human Rights Front to hold the march, but the demonstrators were undeterred. Instead, a mixed crowd made up of hardcore protesters in black wearing masks alongside families with children marched for more than  1.2 miles, some waving U.S. and British flags. “We hope our children have a future, because now in Hong Kong, we cannot see any hope,” a woman named Charis, who brought her 7-month old daughter to the demonstration, told the Wall Street Journal. “We need to stand here, we need to walk here.” The march featured protesters who burned Chinese flags and tore down banners congratulating China’s ruling Communist Party, which will celebrate its 70th year in power on Oct. 1. In familiar scenes, some protesters smashed glass windows and surveillance cameras at a subway station exit. Some protesters also carried large American flags and a large banner that read, “President Trump Please Liberate Hong Kong.”

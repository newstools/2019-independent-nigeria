Some Barcelona stars were so desperate to bring Neymar back to Spain from Paris Saint-Germain, that they were prepared to fork out for the Brazilian from their own pockets, it has been reported. The saga that surrounded Neymar’s destination post was one of the talking points of the summer, with the superstar forward keen to re-join Barcelona and leave behind a difficult spell in Paris. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The move ultimately did not come to fruition with Barcelona unable to come up with the financial package to re-sign the player thay left Camp Nou in 2017 for a world-record €222m. As an agreement for the Brazilian star was set to go down to the wire, Catalan daily Sport reports that a number of Barcelona’s own players were so desperate to play alongside the PSG forward, that they offered to pay part of the transfer fee with their own money. Apparently, one of the most senior players in Ernesto Valverde’s side told Barça president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, that Neymar was the key to La Blaugrana’s hopes of winning the Champions League this season and pushed for a deal to be completed. The Barcelona board didn’t accept the offer from their players, but it demonstrated how important Neymar’s former teammates believed this deal to be.

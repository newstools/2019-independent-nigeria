Charges have been filed against an 18-year-old man in connection with the “forcible drowning” of a 17-year-old Georgia girl– and the victim’s relatives are demanding justice. Police in Roswell, Georgia, have charged Elijah Foster with concealing the death of Mercedes Chico-Sims, who died in May, PEOPLE reports. Foster and Mercedes have been described as acquaintances. PEOPLE confirms medical examiners in Georgia determined Mercedes’ death was a homicide. Mercedes, who would have turned 18 this week, was found dead in a pool behind a Johns Creek apartment complex on May 29. Her body showed signs of “obvious” trauma, PEOPLE learns from authorities. Foster has not been accused of killing Mercedes at this time, prosecutors confirm. “The Fulton County District Attorney’s Office and the Roswell Police Department are yet to receive the complete autopsy report from the Fulton County Medical Examiner’s Office,” reads a statement from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office. “Once we receive that report, we will make an official charging decision within 30 days.”

ABUJA – Ibrahim Magu, the acting chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), on Thursday, pledged to recover all Nigeria’s stolen assets for the development of the nation. Speaking at a session between him and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, and other top executives of the anti-corruption agencies at the National Assembly complex, Abuja, Magu said; “I am very committed to the recovery of stolen funds wherever they are located which should be utilised through budgetary system to remedy the harm the theft has caused.” While intimating the lawmakers on the recent achievements of the commission in the fight against cyber fraud, especially the outcomes of EFCC’s collaboration with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Magu said the just concluded ‘Operation Rewired’ helped in the recovery of stolen funds. “The just concluded ‘Operation Rewired’ resulted in the recovery of the sum of $169,850 as well as N92 million,” adding that lots of expensive cars and several plots of land were also recovered during the operation across Nigeria. He also pointed at the $40 million worth of jewelry just forfeited to the Federal Government by former Minister of Petroleum Resources, Diezani Alison-Madueke, stating that the EFCC would assist the government to ensure that there was effective utilisation of recovered stolen funds. “In line with government’s commitment to maximising utilisation of the recovered funds, some forfeited properties have been allocated to government agencies in dire need of office accommodation. “I hope that the funds will not just be recovered but be utilised for the benefits of Nigerians,” Magu said. He mentioned the agencies that have benefitted from allocation of recovered assets to include Voice of Nigeria, Pension Transitional Arrangement Directorate, North East Development Commission, National Social Investment Office and Fiscal Responsibility Commission.

Chinese state-sponsored hacking group APT10 is the most likely suspect for yet another attack on the U.S. utility sector. The latest attack in late-August was disclosed today [September 23] by researchers at Proofpoint. It is an almost exact replica of an attack on the same sector earlier this year attributed to APT10—albeit not definitively, and so the same logical conclusion can be drawn this time around, Forbes reports. Dubbed LookBack by the security researchers, both attacks have used spear-phishing emails that purport to be from professional examination boards and which deliver Microsoft Word attachments laced with malware. “We continue to see LookBack malware campaigns targeting the utilities sector in the United States,” warned Proofpoint VP Kevin Epstein. “We’ve seen them demonstrate persistence in the face of public tool disclosure and unsuccessful targeting efforts.”

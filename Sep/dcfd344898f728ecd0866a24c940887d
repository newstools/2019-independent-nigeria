During an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on Wednesday, the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star played a round of “Show Me Your Phone.” The game is simple: The press of a button randomly selects an app from the celebrity’s phone and reveals something they must share from it. Kardashian West, who promised she “didn’t even clean out” her phone beforehand, was up first and was forced to show the last texts between her and her husband, Kanye West. “Okay, it’s fine, it’s so sweet,” she said before revealing a photo West, 42, had texted her of “West Lake” in Wyoming, where he just bought a ranch for their family. “West Lake,” reads the accompanying message. “The first ranch in our family. 50 years from now this will mean so much to us.” “I told you, it’s sweet,” said Kardashian West, 38. “He got a ranch in Wyoming and … there’s something that’s called West Lake. So he took a picture of it and that’s like, a sign. He’s so excited to maybe be moving to Wyoming. Well, not full time.” A source told PEOPLE earlier this week that West has been visiting Cody, Wyoming, and “bought a ranch and is touring local elementary schools.” The insider said the property was previously known as “Monster Lake Ranch,” features panoramic views of the surrounding Rocky Mountains and comes in at just over 4,500 acres. The massive chunk of land cost him $14 million, according to TMZ. “Kanye seems great,” the source said. “He loves Jackson Hole. He thinks it’s the perfect place to create his music.”

LAGOS – Men’s Ministries of Assemblies of God Church, Aboru 1, in Agbele Section of Lagos, has charged all believers within and outside the country to buckle up and make it a point of duty to preach the gospel Jesus Christ to the unreached and yet-to-be saved in the our society. President of the Ministry, while speaking at finale of a week-long programme, Elder Theophilus Ozimede, re-echoed the need to take the message to the people who are yet to give their lives to Christ for them to tap into the benefits of salvation and the life of eternal kingdom, which Jesus freely offered when He died on the cross. Ozimade, who urged Christians not to be deterred in discharging their God’s given mandate that would provide opportunity for all to be saved, further said there was clear evidence that devil and its agents were fighting, maiming and discouraging believers from carrying out the divine assignment.

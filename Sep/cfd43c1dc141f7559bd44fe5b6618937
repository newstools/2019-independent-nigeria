ABUJA – The National Democratic Front (NDF) has warned Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, to desist from making unguarded utterances capable of derailing President Muhammadu Buhari’s government. Secretary General of the group, Dr. Abdukakadir Bolaji, gave the warning in a statement on Sunday. The caution trails Gbajabiamila’s statement on Friday, where he appeared to have chided the service chiefs for failing to honour invitation to the lower chamber. Dr. Abdukakadir Bolaji said the group was appalled by the “careless utterances of the speaker” who also vowed to report the Foreign Affairs Minister to the President over the xenophobic attacks on Nigerians in South Africa. According to the group, there is a grand plot to discredit the administration of President Buhari and Mr Gbajabiamila appears to be in the forefront. However, the National Democratic Front advised the Speaker not to return to the era where instead of parliamentary functions, the legislature issued summons to heads of critical agencies as bait for extortion. The NDF, therefore, urged Mr Gbajabiamila to retrace his steps and not bow to any pressure to derail the country’s democracy. “The National Democratic Front is appalled by the careless utterances of the speaker of the Federal House of Representatives, which by and large presents a despicable picture to members of the unsuspecting general public on how some political office holders though holding sensitive positions of authority, but not in tune with the realities on the ground in the country.

Lagos – Come Tuesday, October 1, 2019, Nigeria will clock 59 years since she attained Independence from colonial rule. Expectedly drums would be rolled out in celebration of the most populous black nation birthday. In 59 years of existence, one of Nigeria’s major achievements is said to be her ability to remain a united nation after surviving the civil war in 1967-70. Interestingly, most Nigerians, including President Muhammadu Buhari believes Nigeria is indivisible and must remain a united nation.  Be that as it may, on Tuesday, as Nigeria celebrates her 59th Independence, the sporting fraternity will not be left out. It is common knowledge that even as Nigeria has not lived up to her potentials in sports, the sector has remained one of the country’s most potent agent of unity just as it is a serious diplomatic tool. However, the general consensus has remained that Nigerian sports has failed to achieve its full potentials as the country’s sportsmen and women have been blowing hot and cold at international competitions since Independence. And in no particular order, Nigeria has produced famous sportsmen and women like the late Dick Tiger and Hogan Bassey, both world boxing champions; ex-Olympians as Isaac Ikhuoria, Peter Konyegwachi, Chioma Ajunwa, Faliat Osheku Ogunkoya, Segun Toriola, Jay Jay Okocha, Emmanuel Amunike, Kanu Nwankwo, Funke Oshonaike and Olusoji Fasugba. Others are Late Rashidi Yekini, Innocent Egbunike, Mercy Mku, Fatima Yusuf, Chidi Imoh, Bose Kaffo, Hakeem Olajuwon, Nduka Odizor, Atanda Musa, Late Stephen Keshi, Nduka Odizor, Late Mike Opara, David Imonite, John Mikel Obi, Blessing Okagbare, among several others. These names have etched the country’s name in gold among sporting nations of the world but most Nigerians believes that the country has failed to achieve her full potentials in sports when compared with less populated and endowed African countries like Kenya, South Africa, Ethiopia in world athletics and the Olympics. Pre-Independence Era It is pertinent to recall that even before Independence; some Nigerians had made appreciable impact in global sports. Such Nigerians who come to mind are Emmanuel Ifejuna who won a gold medal in high jump at the 1954 Commonwealth Games; Hogan Kid Bassey emerged World Featherweight Boxing Champion in 1957 as well as Dick Tiger who won the Middleweight title and later the World Light Heavyweight crown. These were indeed remarkable feats that prepared the ground for Nigeria’s exploits after independence. The country took part in three Commonwealth Games prior to independence. The first was at the Auckland edition in 1950, second was in Vancouver in 1954 and third being in Cardiff in 1958. In all these three Games. The country won a gold, five silver and four bronze medals. Nigeria did not win any medal at the Helsinki and Melbourne Olympics in 1852 and 1956 respectively. 1960 – 1970 After independence Nigeria gradually shook off the shackles of colonialism and began the process of development in all spheres. The country’s first Olympic medalist was the Light Middleweight Boxer, Nojim Maiyegun who won bronze at the Tokyo 1964 Games. It was the first ever medal won in an Olympic event as the boxer became the first medalist since Team Nigeria’s first participation at the 1952 summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland. It did not win any medal at the ERome Olympics in 1960. However, the first step towards sports development was the setting up of the National Sports Commission (NSC) in 1963 with Late Pa Abraham Ordia as the Secretary.  Unfortunately, the immediate past minister of sports, Barrister Solomon Dalung scrapped the commission and sports are now in the care of persons other than trained sports administrators. The clarion call for the return of the NSC has fallen on deaf ears. Thus, early 1960, Nigeria’s emphasis was on putting up structures for sports development and the first fruits no doubt was the qualification of the then Green Eagles for the Olympic Games held in Mexico in 1968. During this decade, Nigeria boycotted the 1962 Commonwealth games in Perth but returned in the 1966 edition held in Kingston, Jamaica and in Edinburgh in 1970 winning five gold, four silver and three bronze. 1971 – 1980 The next step was the setting up of the National Sports Festival (NSF) in 1976 for the discovery of talents that would be nurtured to represent the country in international competitions. The first edition in Lagos was attended by over 6000 athletes. The festival was another balm that helped in healing the wounds of the civil war. Nigeria stepped up the gear in the 70s with her active participation in continental and global competitions. In 1973, Nigeria hosted the 2nd All Africa Games placing second. In 1976 IICC Shooting Stars won the country’s first continental club trophy, winning Africa Cup of Winners with Rangers retaining it the following year. The achievements made in the 70s continued into the 80s still within football as the Green Eagles improved on the bronze medals won at the Africa Nations Cup in 1976 and 1978 to win gold in 1980 on home soil when the Christian Chukwu captained Green Eagles defeated the Desert Warriors of Algeria 3-0 at the National Stadium, Surulere, Lagos to lift the continental trophy for the first time. The country won 10 medals-3 gold, 3 silver and 4 bronze- at the Christchurch Commonwealth Games in 1974, boycotting the 1978 edition Edmonton, Canada. 1981 – 1990 Nigeria’s first triumph on the global stage in football since Independence wan in 1985 when the Golden Eaglets beat Germany 2-0 to win the maiden FIFA/KODAK Under-16 championship in China.. The Flying Eagles also reached the final of the 1989 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Saudi Arabia before losing to Luis Figo inspired Portugal 2-0. Nigeria won its first track and field medal at the Los Angeles Olympics winning bronze in the 4x400m, though failed tpo win a single medal at the Seoul Games in 1988. Also during this decade, the country won 38 medals-10 gold, 13 silver and 15 bronze-for taking part in two Commonwealth games in 1982 in Brisbane and Auckland. 1991 – 2000 Nigeria also won 3 silver and a bronze at the Barcelona Olympics in 1992 to announce her potentials in world athletics. At the Atlanta Olympics, the country won its first gold with Chioma Ajunwa’s feat in Long Jump, leaping 7.12m. The Dream Team added gold a day later. In all the country won 2 gold, silver and 3 bronze medals at these Games. Four years later, the country won the 4x400m men’s gold by default after USA team that won the gold was involved in drug. It also won 2 silver in Sydney. Nigeria won the fifth edition of the FIFA U-17 World Cup in 1993 in Japan. Nigeria defeated fellow African contenders Ghana by 2-1 in the final. After several attempts in winning another Nations Cup title, the 14-year wait was finally over as the Super Eagles won the trophy in Tunisia. The Super Eagles also made their first World Cup appearance in the same year in the United States of America (USA), crashing out in the second round. The team also qualified for the 1998 edition in France also crashing out in the second round losing 4-1 to Denmark. Nigeria has never failed to excel at the Commonwealth Games winning 37 medals-11 gold, 13 silver and 13 bronze at the Victoria Games in 1994. Super Falcons qualified for their maiden World Cup crashing out at the group stage after losing all their group games. At the 1995 edition, Falcons also crashed out at the group stage, though they drew a game losing the other two. The team’s World Cup best outing was at the 1999 edition where they reached the quarter-final losing to Brazil by the odd goal in extra time. But won the women’s AFCON in 1991 retained it in 1995, 1998 and 2000. The team’s maiden Olympics games appearance in 2000 was a huge failure crashing out at the group stage 2001 – 2010 Although Nigeria has failed to build on the success of Atlanta ’96, the country has recorded other victories in world and continental events like the 2003 All Africa Games she hosted in Abuja and tagged ‘COJA’; the 2007 FIFA Under-17 World Cup in South Korea. After winning the 2007 U-17 competition play hosted by South Korea, Nigeria became the most successful team at teenage level. Following Nigeria’s pedigree at cadet level, FIFA handed the hosting rights of the 2009 U-17 World Cup to the nation’s highest football governing body and tournament was successfully staged. The country won 19 medals-5 gold, 3 silver, 11 bronze- at the Commonwealth Games in Manchester in 2002. Also 2006 in Melbourne, 17 medals-4  gold, 6 silver and 7 bronze-were won. In Delhi in 2010 Nigeria won 11 gold, 8 silver and 14 bronze medals. In Athens Olympics, only 2 bronze medals were won while Beijing Olympics produced 3 silver and 2 bronze. Nigeria crashed out at the group stage of the 2002 World Cup co-hosted by South Korea/Japan. The team failed to qualify for the 2006 edition in Germany. It made up by qualifying for the first World Cup on Africa soil-South Africa- crashing out at the group stage. In 2003 Super Falcons crashed out at the group stage of the FIFA World Cup with the same fate also befalling them in 2007. It was the same sad story failing to go past the group stage at the Athens Olympics and the Beijing Olympics. But they made up by retaining the CAF Women’s championship in 2002, 2004, 2006. They lost for the first time in 2008 placing third while they won the trophy in 2010. 2011 – 2019 Nigeria won the FIFA U-17 World Cup for the fourth time in 2013 edition in The United Arab Emirates (UAE). The same year Nigeria won the Africa Cup of Nations for the third time in South Africa. The team qualified for the FIFA World Cup in Brazil, losing 2-0 to France in the second round. It also qualified for the 2018 edition in Russia also crashing out at the group stage. One of Nigeria’s most successful track queens Blessing Okagbare wrote her name in the Guinness Book of Records for the most appearances in the Diamond League meet in 2015. She beat Jamaican 100m and 200m record holder to the award after appearing 38 times in the Track and Field events in that year alone. The Golden Eaglets successfully defended the title they won in UAE and consolidated it with another heroic feat in Chile during the 2015 FIFA Under-17 World Cup. 2015 won the AfroBasket championships for the first time, thus becoming Africa Champions for the first time after failing on several attempts. The Olumide Oyedeji captained side defeated eternal rivals Angola to win the competition and were handed automatic qualification spot at the Rio Olympic Games in 2016. Aruna Quadri competed for Nigeria in the table tennis event at the 2012 Summer Olympics and 2016 Summer Olympics, reaching the quarterfinals in the latter competition. At the World Cup 2014, he reached the quarterfinals in the Men’s Singles competition. Aruna competed in the 2017 ITTF African-Cup, qualifying for the quarterfinals where he defeated Algerias Naim Karali (4-1). In the semifinals, Aruna defeated Egyptian player Mohamed El-beiali (4-3), qualifying for the finals. In the Finals, Aruna played and defeated long-time rival Omar Assar in a close match (4-3). Aruna won the event, and become the 2017 African-Cup Champion. Aruna competed in the World Championships seeded as number 30. He defeated Chilean player Gustavo Gómez (4-0). He was defeated in the second round by Danish player and number 34 seed, Jonathan Groth. Aruna competed in the 2018 ITTF African-Cup, placing first in group 2, allowing him to qualify for the Quarter Finals. In the Quarter Finals, Aruna defeated Derek Abrefa (4-0). In the semifinals, he defeated Ahmed Saleh (4-1), allowing him to advance to the finals of the African-Cup. The female national football team is the best African side in the tournament in history bagging the Nations Cup 10 times, a feat far better than any other African side. Nigeria hosted and won the Nation Cup tourney in 1991, 1998, 2002 and 2006. The only two editions Nigeria did not win came in 2008 and 2012 tournaments which were won by Equatorial Guinea. At the 2017 FIBA Women’s Afrobasket championships in Bamako, D’Tigress were third time winners of the championships played in Bamako, Mali. The Nigerian team won all six fixtures in the competition including the 65-48 victory against Senegal in the final. In 2014 Nigeria won 36 medals-11 gold, 11 silver and 14 bronzes- at the Commonwealth games in Glasgow, while also winning 24 medals-9 gold, 9 silver and 6 bronze-at the Gold Coast Games in 2018. The team narrowly lost to Cameroun by a point in the semis in 2015 but were crowned champions again after their last win in 2005. The D’Tigress recently finished 8th in FIBA Women World Cup – the best position ever by an African country. Falcons lost the continental title for the second time in 2012 but returned to winning ways in 2014, 2016, 2018. At the 2011 and 2015 World Cups, they did not go past the group stage but reached the second round at the 2019 edition. Part of our failures was at London 2012 Olympics where Team Nigeria could not win a single medal. Even in the 2016 Rio Olympics, it as the Dream Team’s silver medal that saved the ugly situation for Team Nigeria. Postscript So in over 13 Olympics appearances, Nigeria has won three gold medals. This is indeed a miserable record when compared with what other smaller African nations like Kenya and Ethiopia have achieved. It must be mentioned here that Nigeria’s saving grace are the Paralympians who have remained very consistent in their performances. Most of these physically challenged athletes like Monday Emoghawve, Edith Nzuruike, Adekundo Adesoji, Eucharia Njideka and Yakubu Adesokan took turns to break and set new world records in their events. Although football has brought fame to Nigeria, the country is yet to fully realise her potentials in the game. In six appearances at the FIFA World Cup, Nigeria with its array of stars is yet to reach the semifinals. Off the field of play, Nigeria has not been left behind in the politics of international organisations as some notable Nigerians like the late Orok Oyo, Dotun Segun, Habu Gumel, Dr.Amos Adamu, Sani Ndanusa and Violet Nwajei-Odogwu, Awoture Eleaye and late Abraham Ordia, among others held executive positions in different international sports federations. Interestingly, Nigerians like Ndanusa, Gumel, Wahid Oshodi, Amaju Pinnick are actively involved in sports politics on the continent and the world.  Apart from winning some medals at the global stage, Nigeria has also played host to other nations on several occasions when she hosted international competitions like the 2nd and 8th All Africa Games (AAG), the 1999 FIFA U20 World Cup and the 2009 FIFA U17 World Cup. It is also encouraging to note that successive governments have shown interest in sports as the nation boasts of some sporting edifices like the M.K. O Abiola National Stadium, Abuja. Although most of these facilities like the National Stadium, Lagos have been left to decay, Nigerian athletes out of determination and dint of luck have continued to prove that all hope is not lost. However, most Nigerians still view the sector with mixed feelings because so much is promised by sports but so little is offered in terms of achievements. This is usually attributed to poor management of human and material resources. Unfortunately, there are no signs of immediate recovery as the present trend which has seen Nigeria missing out of international competitions is said to a source of great concern. Even as achievements in the sports sector have fallen short of expectations, it cannot be denied that there have been some glorious moments and if the sector is re-organised with the right people at the helm of affairs, more achievement would be made in the near future. There is no doubt that sports in Nigeria is on the decline but the entire world knows that Nigeria’s problem is not talents but how to harness and utilize the talents that abound in the nooks and crannies of the country. So for sports in Nigeria, there isn’t much to celebrate but there is certainly something to think about as the country clocks 59 years on Tuesday.

Ericsson has been co-operating voluntarily with investigations by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) regarding the company’s compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Ericsson makes a SEK 12 b. provision related to resolving the investigations that will impact the third quarter 2019 results, to cover an estimated monetary sanction of USD 1.0 b, plus other related costs. The process to find a resolution is still ongoing. The company has been co-operating voluntarily since 2013 with an investigation by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and, since 2015, with an investigation by the United States Department of Justice into its compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the process is still ongoing. The investigation covers a period ending Q1 2017 and revealed breaches of the company’s Code of Business Ethics and the FCPA in six countries: China, Djibouti, Indonesia, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Vietnam. The company previously communicated that the resolution of the investigations will result in material financial and other measures. While Ericsson cannot comment in detail on the ongoing process with the U.S. authorities, the company can with current visibility now estimate the cost and thus make a provision, which will impact the third quarter 2019 results by SEK 12 b. The provision constitutes the company’s current estimate of expenditure related to resolving the U.S. investigations, of which the combined monetary sanctions from SEC and DOJ is estimated at USD 1 b., and the remainder pertains to other costs related to resolving the investigation. The provision will be booked as Other Operating Expenses in the income statement of Segment Emerging Business and Other.

LAGOS – The Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN) has postponed its Annual General Congress (AGC) earlier scheduled to hold on Thursday, December 4, 2019 in Awka,Anambra. In a letter dated Friday, November 22, 2019 and signed by its Secretary General, Prince Adeniyi Beyioku and addressed to all States Athletics Associations, the AFN said it was constrained by circumstances beyond its control to postpone the AGC. ” On behalf of the board of the AFC, I am directed to inform you of the postponement of the AGC earlier scheduled for December 4,2019 in Awka,Anambra state due to circumstances beyond our control, ‘read the letter to the States Athletics Associations titled :Re-Invitation To Attend AGC of AFN. The AFN further informed that a new date will be communicated to the state associations and regretted the inconveniences the postponement may have caused. Our correspondent however gathered that the postponement may have been informed by the need to adhere to the letters of the constitution of the AFN and international best practice. A chairman of one of the state athletics associations in the South South region of Nigeria who preferred not to be named told our correspondent that many of the state athletics associations were shocked when they received the message for the December 4, 2019 AGC. “We knew for an AGC to be called, the AFN constitution stipulates a 60-day notice and the notice sent to us was dated November 5 which makes it just 29 days to the December 4 date, “said the member who expressed his gratitude to the AFN for correcting its own mistake.”

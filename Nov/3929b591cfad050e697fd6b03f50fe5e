LAGOS – The Nigerian Football Federation (NFF) has pledged to give Coach Gernot Rohr every support for him to succeed in his work as the manager of the Super Eagles. The football house, however, did not comment on the contract renewal of the coach. The question was coming following what looked like an ultimatum giving to the NFF by the coach that on January 1, 2020, he would quit the job if the football house failed to open up renewal talks. Although he would love to extend his contract, the former Bordeaux manager revealed that he has been approached by other Federations and would start talking to them if NFF fail to offer him a new deal before January. “I’m ready to discuss as I have other federations who want me but I tell them that my priority is to discuss with the NFF. “But after January 1, I’ll be free to sign where I want. So I think the next step is to wait to see what NFF is doing.” But speaking to DAILY INDEPENDENT on Monday, Seyi Akinwunmi, the 1st Vice President of the NFF, said that the football house would not renege in its responsibility of supporting Coach Rohr or any other national team manager to succeed, saying that contract renewal was a new focus entirely. “We are obliged to support the coach and any other coach for that matter and we will continue to do that,” he said. On contract renewal as the coach wanted, the football technocrat said the issue is not what he would talk on the pages of newspaper, assuring that the right thing would be done. “That issue is not for this talk; besides, we will make sure the right thing is done at the right time,” he concluded.

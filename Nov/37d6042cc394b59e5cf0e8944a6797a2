LAGOS – The national U23 team will file out today against their Zambian counterparts with one thing in their mind which is to win the game. Failure to get the three points may likely see the Imama Amapakabo tutored side bid the ongoing CAF U23 Cup of Nation good bye. In Nigeria’s opening game on Saturday, they succumbed to Ivory Coast 0-1. Ivory Coast’s Silas Gnaka converted a penalty after Olisa Ndah committed a foul that resulted in him being sent off, leaving Nigeria to play the final 20 minutes a man short. Later on that Saturday, South Africa – who came to Egypt with a severely depleted squad – drew 0-0 with Zambia in the second Group B match, leaving the defending champions, Nigeria, last in the group. Meanwhile, the Nigerian camp has been boosted by the arrival of Istanbul Basaksehir midfielder Okechukwu Azubuike and Mainz striker Taiwo Awoniyi, who were not earlier released by their clubs. Azubuike and Awoniyi were released late by their clubs due to involvement in the Turkish Super Lig and German Bundesliga, respectively. Zambia, on their own, have been boosted with the imminent arrival of KV Oostende forward, Fashion Sakala, and RB Salzburg’s Patson Daka, who has set the Austrian Bundesliga alight with 12 goals in 13 matches this season. Speaking of the match, Coach Amapakabo said: “We will throw everything into the game against Zambia because we have left ourselves no choice at this point. “I believe we have the team to not only overcome Zambia but go all the way in the tournament. “We stumbled against the Ivorians but we have learnt from that and we now look forward to rescuing our campaign against the Zambians and South Africans.”

The Okowa’s aide, who is a former Peoples Democratic Party PDP, Chairman of Burutu Council Area of Delta stated that, night and day never meets so as water and oil is always separated. While hailing the judgement, he noted that,Court of Appeal in Abuja has no choice but to  dismissed the case filed by the candidate of the (APC), Ogboru on the March 2019 Governorship Elections in Delta state for lacking in merit. Edeinmene held that the unanimous decision by a panel of five justices affirmed the decisions of the tribunal, which upheld the victory  of Okowa’s at the governorship election, which stressed shows that, the Judiciary was fair and just. “This judgement is victory for democracy because, the Judiciary has always proven that they are just and always committed to the course of justice and equity.

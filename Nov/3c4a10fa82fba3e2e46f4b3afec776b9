LAGOS – Senator Rochas Okorocha has taken a swipe at some Imo traditional rulers of Mbaise extraction, accusing them of desecrating the monarchy by their actions when they poured libations and invoked curses on sons of Mbaise for failing to support the state governor, Emeka Ihedioha. In a press statement made available to journalists on Tuesday by Sam Onwuemeodo, media assistant to the former governor, Okorocha maintained that traditional rulers from Mbaise, on Monday, gathered at the popular Ahiara Junction that connects the three local government areas of Ahiazu, Ezinihitte and Aboh and invoked the gods, poured libation and heavily cursed sons and daughters of Mbaise who had not supported Governor Ihedioha. The former governor stressed that when the late Sam Mbakwe was governor of the state, the traditional rulers from Obowo never did what the Mbaise traditional rulers had done, pointing out that neither did former governors like late Evans Enwerem, Achike Udenwa nor Ikedi Ohakim dabble into such fetish acts. “They said that the gods would come after all those supporting Uche Nwosu of Action Alliance, Ifeanyi Araraume of All Progressives Grand Aliance (APGA) and Hope Uzodinma of All Progressives Congress (APC) because those ‘gods’ have mouths but do not speak, have ears but do not hear, have nose but do not perceive, have legs but do not walk and those who make them and worship them, are like them. “Our own God is the creator of heaven and earth, the author of our faith and finisher of our concord that makes the difference,” he said. Okorocha wondered why the traditional rulers could not advise Ihedioha to do the work for which he was called as the governor of Imo State, rather than busy themselves chasing shadows. He maintained that the Mbaise traditional rulers were setting a very bad precedent and would not know the long term and short term implications of their disdainful action.

LAGOS – Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Mr. Sunday Dare has said the Team Nigeria will only take part in nine sports at next year’s Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan. The Minister said towards this, the ministry is on its toes to see that all the sports that qualified for the Games are well taken care of to achieve results. “Right now we are working on our teams to see that they qualify first. We are going to concentrate on the medal prospective sports. “We are monitoring our athletes both home and abroad to make sure they are in the right shape for the games,” he said Dare disclosed that a ministerial Committee for the Olympic Games will soon be inaugurated towards ensuring that Nigeria is well represented. He added that an Olympics Fund Raising Committee will also be floated with some philanthropists involved as government alone cannot do it. “Individual athlete will be adopted by each philanthropist that will be responsible for his or her training funds and other logistics,” he said. The Minister said the various sports going to Japan will go into camp that will be located in six geographical locations of the country in 90 days’ time. The final camping exercise will hold in Kisarazu City, Japan the organic city ahead of the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. It would be recalled that Dare last week signed the MoU with the Mayor of Kisarazu City, Yoshikuni Watanabe signaling direction of early preparation for the Olympic Games.

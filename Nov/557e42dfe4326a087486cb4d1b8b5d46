The Federal High Court, Abuja has fixed February 25 to deliver judgment in the N400 million fraud charge against former National Publicity Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party, (PDP) Olisa Metuh. Justice Okon Abang fixed the date on Tuesday after listening to the final written addresses by counsel in the matter. Metuh’s Defence counsel, Mr Abel Oziokor submitted that one of the offences Metuh was standing trial for was collecting money for a contract and not executing same. He, however, said that a prosecution witness, PW3, during his testimony, had told the court that he investigated Federal Government contracts awarded during the period but did not find Metuh’s name as a beneficiary of any contract. Oziokor also told the court that it was established that the office of the National Security Adviser disbursed the money for security services. He also said that Metuh used the money for the exact purpose and due process was followed to the letter. The counsel further argued that the prosecution failed to establish a predicate offence upon which the money laundering charge against Metuh could be sustained.

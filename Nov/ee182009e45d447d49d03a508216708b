Jogging in ranks, energetically clearing bricks, barriers, and debris in a choreographed action as swift as it was disciplined, opinions were divided over the sudden appearance of Chinese soldiers on Hong Kong’s streets on Saturday (Nov 16). The debut of plain-clothes soldiers from a Chinese PLA barracks in Kowloon Tong was welcomed by some as a timely demonstration of order and power, in a city caught in a near six-month crisis.

Lawmaker Claudia Mo urged the city to “stay alert” following the “political PR show”.

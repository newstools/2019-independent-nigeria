LAGOS – The Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA) has said that it installed the Category III Instrument Landing System (ILS) at runway 18Right of the Murtala Mohammed International Airport (MMIA), Lagos in order to improve the navigational facilities in the country. The agency said it also responded to the demands and clamour by airline operators who craved for better navigational aids for the industry. Capt. Fola Akinkuotu, Managing Director, NAMA, who made the declarations yesterday in Lagos at the trial run of the newly installed facilities, said the exercise, which started on Monday, indicated that the equipment is fully operational on test basis, even as all the ILS components – localiser, glide slope and Distance Measuring Equipment are propagating signals optimally. Akinkuotu said the alignment of the facility had already been done by the engineers. This, according to him was to ensure that the equipment aligned with the centre line of the runway and also that it is aligned with the descent path that will be comfortable to arrive the threshold at a good landing height to make a normal landing. “In a couple of weeks, we will bring a calibration aircraft to fly in and certify that the equipment is good to go.’’ He said according to the timelines, CAT III ILS would be available at both Lagos and Abuja airports by the third week of December 2019. “The CAT II ILSs we have right now are 800 meters visibility. With the CAT III system you will be able to come down lower and when you are closer to the runway you will be able to see it better. A CAT III operation is a precision approach at lower than CAT II minima.”

After a crazy Champions League game on Tuesday night against Ajax, the Blues are back in Premier League action at the weekend against Crystal Palace. The 4-4 draw in midweek would surely have taken something out of the players, with the intense nature of the match and the game being played at such a fast pace. It could mean a few changes for the Blues and Frank Lampard is going to have some decisions to make over who he puts in for the match against the Eagles. The Blues are coming off the back of a five-game winning run in the Premier League and it could be a great opportunity to continue the run ahead of the international break. But what are the changes that Lampard could make this weekend at Stamford Bridge? Emerson for Alonso It was not a good night on Tuesday for Marcos Alonso as he had a poor first half and then was taken off at half-time by Frank Lampard. The Spaniard has been the stand-in left-back with Emerson Palmieri having struggled with injuries this season, but the Italy international is certainly the number one choice. Against Ajax, Cesar Azpilicueta moved to left-back with Reece James coming on as the right-back, but it could be Emerson moving back into his role on the left. It is only a matter of time until James make his first Premier League start, but it might not be this weekend. Hudson-Odoi for Mount One worry for Frank Lampard and the Blues was seeing Mason Mount limp off in the 60th minute of Tuesdayâ€™s clash after a knock to his ankle. The England international was obviously in a lot of pain, and having played a lot of football this year already it could be a good chance to rest him. That might allowed Callum Hudson-Odoi to start again, with him moving out to the left wing and Christian Pulisic could move into the number 10 role in a 4-2-3-1. Lampard will be keen for his team to break down a stubborn Eagles side, and this could be the best way to do that.

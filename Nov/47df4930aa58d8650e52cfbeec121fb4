LAGOS – Coalition of All Support Group (COASG), a political pressure group, has said that the emergence of Deji Doherty as the Lagos State chairman of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) will deepen democracy in the state. The group had in a congratulatory message sent to Doherty, made available to journalists on Thursday,  stated that Lagos was gradually becoming one party state, with the crisis which had threatened the party during and after the last general elections which adversely affected its outing at the last poll. It maintained that Doherty, as a grassroots politician, would bring the party back to becoming a strong opposition to the All Progressives Congress (APC) in order to guarantee democracy in the state. Comrade Mark Iheanyi, chairman of the group, maintained that there would be no effective democracy without a strong opposition, stressing that as a political guru and an astute politician, Doherty, having taken over mantle of leadership of the major opposition party in the state, would better the lot of the state. “When you talk about stability, you would understand why Doherty is the best choice for the party. He has contested elections as governorship candidate of the party for about four times without jumping from one party to another; that is how you know a reliable person. He has the capacity to bring PDP together because of his great love for the party. “He is known for his doggedness and will always stand firm for what he believes in; he will bring the same spirit to the office. He will make the APC government accountable to the people, which is what makes democracy thrive,” he said. While congratulating Dohery, Iheanyi wished the new chairman God’s blessings and wisdom to take the plough and set for the unity and growth of the party in the state.

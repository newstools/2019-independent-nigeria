Lagos – Adegboye Onigbinde, former Super Eagles manager, has absolved Imama Amapakabo, the coach of the U23 national team currently campaigning at the ongoing CAF U23 African Cup of Nations, of any blame. The veteran coach and former CAF and FIFA instructor was reacting to the fall of Nigeria at their opening game against their Ivorian counterparts. After a goalless first half, Cote d’Ivoire, however, grabbed a winner in the 71st-minute after a penalty awarded by Egyptian referee, Mohamed Maarouf. That was after a Nigeria defender, lisa Ndah, was giving a red card in the 71st minute. While Amapakabo failed to advance Nigeria at the WAFU Championship in Senegal earlier in the year and also failed to qualify Nigeria for the 2020 African Nations Championship (CHAN), all with home base players, Nigerians expected that his squad currently campaigning in Egypt with predominantly foreign base players would click. However, it was once again a poor display as they succumbed to Cote d’Ivoire in their opening game on Saturday, raising a huge question on the coach’s technical depth. But Onigbinde, who has serially been a critic of poor system in Nigeria,  in a chat with DAILY INDPENDENT,  jumped to the coach’s defence, saying there was no proper system on ground to ensure continuous training and retraining of coaches in the country, noting that even developmental programmes to unearth quality talents were lacking in the country, wondering whether Nigerians were expecting magic. “It’s a shame Cote d’Ivoire beating us like that and you want me to blame the cocah. Yes I am a coach as well but what system has been put on ground to make sure that these coaches continue to be trained? “We have some domestic league players among them and what was their fitness and pedigree going to that competition? “The system here may not warrant a good coach performing. Instead of blaming the coach, look at the poor system we have in Nigeria and blame it,” he said.

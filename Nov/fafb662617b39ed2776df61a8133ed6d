Abuja – A Coalition of Civil Society group called Center For Liberty has called on the United States of America and United Kingdom ( UK ) to extend Visa ban to politicians and officials who may work to undermine the elections in Kogi and Bayelsa states. Besides, the group raised the alarm of plans by some people to cause havoc and disrupt the Saturday gubernatorial elections in the states. The group disclosed this on Thursday in Abuja while submitting a petition to the Ambassadors of the United States of America and the United Kingdom ( UK ) in Nigeria at their embassies. Addressing journalists after the meeting, the Co-convener, Ariyo-Dare Atoye said the plot to undermine the two elections was real and there have been reported incidents of violence and killings. According to the group, “We strongly advocate further extension of Visa restriction to the immediate family members of the affected politicians, individuals and officials responsible for undermining our elections”. The petition reads, ‘We wish to draw the attention of the US, UK, European Union and other development partners to the build-up of the forth-coming governorship elections in Kogi and Bayelsa, scheduled for November 16th, 2019, which is gradually assuming a worrying dimension. He added, “The plot to undermine the two elections are real and there have been reported incidents of violence and killings” Atoye expressed worry at the way in which the ruling government annexed the legislature, judiciary and prevailed on the media in a bid to foist a fascist state on Nigeria. He said “There is currently an ongoing effort to emasculate the social media in Nigeria, which is now the last-hold of the common man and the last impediment to a fascist state in Nigeria.”

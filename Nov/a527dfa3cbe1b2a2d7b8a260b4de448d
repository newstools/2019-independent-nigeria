LAGOS – Biodun Salami, All Progressives Congress (APC), Lagos State Assistant Publicity Secretary, has said that the party has been magnanimous to former Governor Akinwumi Ambode. Salami, while speaking with Daily Independent in an interview, said that he found it difficult to understand why anyone would insinuate that the party was unfair to the former governor because he was required to put the record straight on certain actions he took during his days as the helmsman of the state. “Why should some of his supporters say that he was being punished? Do they mean that the issues that he was being accused of did not happen? I don’t understand what they mean by that he was treated unjustly. “We should forget sentiments and talk about issues. If after the panel sits and it is discovered that he did not commit those things he was been accused of, then he would be exonerated, but if found guilty he should be made to face the law that is how this country should be run. “When you play by the rules of the game, you would not have problems. An allegation has been brought up against him. I am not his lawyer and I can’t say precisely what has happened but I am sure that the allegation is transparently clear; 820 buses were bought without due process, and he is so enlightened and far more enlightened than me to know what the law says,” he said. The APC chieftain maintained that Ambode should have gone through the Lagos Assembly before doing the procurement, but unfortunately he did not do that. He said that the case was in the court and he would comment on it. Salami said that the party had been very supportive of the former governor. According to him, the party assisted him to get to that position and was there for him through the period he held sway as governor. He stressed that if the governor had done what he should do, there would be no need for what was playing out now.

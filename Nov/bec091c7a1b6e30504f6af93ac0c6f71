The national coordinator of New Nigerian Democratic Evolution (NNDE), Comrade Francis Obule has condemned outright the proposed hate speech bill that was initiated by Senator Aliyu Sabi Abdullahi, the Senator representing Niger North Senatorial District at the National Assembly. Comrade Obule, who spoke to newsmen in Warri, Delta State gave reasons why the hate speech bill should not be entertained by the legislators, stressing that the bill was not only against human dignity but also meant to silent freedom of speech as guaranteed by the Constitution of Nigeria and the United Nations Charter of Bill of Rights. He affirmed that the hate speech bill was meant to protect looters, top government officials and also to silence opposition, stressing that the legislators are chasing shadow instead of substance. Comrade Obule, who is the pioneer chairman of DESOPADEC Indigenous Contractors Forum noted that during the various campaigns none of the legislators mentioned anything on hate speech, rather they promised to provide jobs, reduce unemployment rate in Nigeria, provide food on our table and reduce cost of living but we can see clearly now that most of them have failed in the promises they gave during their campaigns and have resort to the use of hate speech as a weapon to silence the masses who are ready to shout whenever the senators are derailing from their primary duty and their inability to fulfill their electoral campaign promises. He noted that such a draconian and unpopular bill should not be contemplated or be taken seriously by the apex chamber of the National Assembly. According to him “The only means which Nigerian[s can talk to them is through the media as a way of correcting them or notifying them about their promises but not to use it as means to abuse or insult them or other leaders, however, we will continue to remind them of their promises and lapses and refer them to the political manifesto they gave to Nigerians during their campaigns.”

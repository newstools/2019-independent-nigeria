The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has accused the All Progressives Congress (APC) of sending armed thugs to attack its leaders, including Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, and its candidate, Musa Wada, in Lokoja, Kogi state. PDP said that several “hooded APC thugs, armed with automatic rifles and other dangerous weapons, invaded the venue of the meeting which had Governor Makinde, Engr. Wada, his running mate, Hon. Samuel Aro, the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, as well as other party chieftains in attendance.” The opposition party stated this in a statement signed by its spokesperson, Kola Ologbondiyan.

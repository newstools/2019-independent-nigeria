Barcelona director Eric Abidal spoke over the weekend about Barcelona’s desire to land Neymar, insisting that he is still an option for the Catalan club. ‘A top player, who has a Barca philosophy and who is performing at a high level, will always be an option,’ the former full-back said. ‘From there, at the sports level we can make decisions, but the whole financial issue, there are things that you can reach and others that you cannot. ‘The future will say. If it continues at this level, because the season is very long, I will not say that it will be option No 1 but it can be a clear option.’

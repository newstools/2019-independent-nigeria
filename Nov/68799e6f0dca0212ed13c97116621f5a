LAGOS – Worried by the high level of violence and palpable tension ahead of Saturday’s gubernatorial election in Kogi State, Challenge Parenthood Initiative (CPI), an election observer group has called on security agencies to strategise and check all forms of violence and thuggery activities, give Kogi people hope of their safety. While speaking with Saturday INDEPENDENT on Friday, Eunice Abimbola Abogun, executive director of CPI and vice chairperson Kogi Network of Non-Governmental Organisations had stated that the atmosphere was tensed, tension high and palpable fear around the State. She said it was unfortunate that the areas that they thought were flashpoints were not the only places with security challenges, stressing that politicians had become too desperate and resorted to importation of thugs into the State. Abogun could be speaking from the point of view of a reported case of assault of Social Democratic Party (SDP) candidate for Saturday’s election, who was said to be assaulted in front of the Inspector General of Police (IGP) in Kogi State. “On Wednesday, the gubernatorial candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) was attacked and prevented from entering the venue of Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) stakeholders meeting venue, where the INEC chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, Inspector General of Police (IGP) and all gubernatorial candidates in the election were expected at the meeting. “The SDP candidate was prevented by political thugs, who she alleged were All Progressives Congress (APC) thugs. She was beaten and pushed to the floor. “We want to use this opportunity to call on security agencies to ensure the safety of Kogi people on Saturday and assure Kogi people that they would be given the necessary protection to encourage them to come out and exercise their franchise,” she said.

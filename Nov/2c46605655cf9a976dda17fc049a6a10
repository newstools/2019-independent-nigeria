The Ohio Air National Guard’s 178th Wing unit based in Springfield is being considered by the National Guard Bureau for a role in a new U.S. Space Force. “The fact that one of our squadrons in that group already contributes to space intelligence analysis, it might be a natural fit for us,” Brig. Gen. James Camp, assistant adjutant general for Air, Ohio National Guard, said Monday. “I think right now, the fact that they reached out to us directly by name and said, ‘Hey, we’re very interested in the skill set at the 178th ISR group, would you be interested in entertaining a space mission,’ I think that in and of itself is a very optimistic story,” Camp added, using the acronym for “intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance.” Powered by RubiQube Ad Network It was too soon to say when and how the wing would fit into an emerging Space Force, the one-star general cautioned. “I have to tell you, there are a lot of unanswered questions,” Camp said. At a change of command ceremony Sunday, Camp announced the Springfield Air National Guard unit was aiming for a role in the new Space Force. “I’m happy to say that it looks like in the very near future, our ISR group may switch to a space intel mission,” Camp said. With nearly 1,000 members, it is the 178th’s mission to conduct support for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance operations at the federal and state level. As part of that role, the wing consists of four intelligence squadrons supporting national and combatant command work at the National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC), based at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

The Lagos State government says it will begin enforcement of material testing at construction sites, to achieve its vision of zero tolerance for building collapse in the state. Acting General Manager, Lagos State Materials and Testing Laboratory (LSML), Mr Olalekan Ajani, disclosed this on Saturday, in Lagos. Ajani said the agency was passionate about forestalling incidences of building collapses, adding that the Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s administration had empowered the agency with increased workforce across all local governments and local council development areas. “Lagos State is stepping up operation in construction sites to see that builders comply with the quality assurance of the state to forestall cases of building collapse. “We want to ensure a zero incidence of building collapse through regular visits to the construction sites; this is the only way to save lives in conformity with the state’s extant laws. “Our officers are now recruited in all local governments, working and checking all the sites for compliance and enforcement; that is what we are stepping up now. “LSML officers are mandated to visit construction sites frequently now to ensure that builders have quality assurance certificate; and if anyone is found wanting, the site will be shut down,” he said. Ajani said that even completed structures would not be spared from supervision and quality control, as they would also undergo non-destructive tests.

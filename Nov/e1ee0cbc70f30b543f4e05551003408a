With continued shortfall in supply from major suppliers of onions due to the season of scarcity, prices of the commodity which started skyrocketing in July are yet to come down. The closure of surrounding borders by the Federal Government has not helped the situation, as neighbouring countries were finding it extremely hard to bring the produce into the Nigerian market. This, however, resulted to a sharp drop in the quantities of the produce supplied from major sources, the North, especially in this season of scarcity. However, in spite of the significant hike in the prices of onions by traders, consumers still patronise the commodity owing to the health benefits. Besides, there is hardly any delicacy prepared that onions would not be included because of its unique taste. Visits to various markets across some states by the Business and Market Intelligence Unit of SUNDAY INDEPENDENT revealed that the commodity was actually scarce as some traders who sell the commodity have swapped to another cheaper business owing to the huge amount of money involved in getting normal purchases. But the ones who are still in the business attributed the situation to high demand usually associated with off-season effect. Since prices of the commodity are influenced by seasonal factors, this year’s was not an exception but appeared to be more unfavourable as the produce from other countries could not enter into the Nigerian market due to closure of all borders. The situation saw the prices rising by over 50 and 30 percent in few markets between August and November 7, 2019. During the week, checks at the Ogbeogologo and Igbudu markets, Delta State, showed that prices of a 100kg bag of onions were at a rising trend. For example, a bag that was previously sold for between N18,000 and N20,000 in August grew by 50 percent, currently selling within the region of N27,000 and N30,000 depending on the market, size of the bag and the haggling power of the customer. Mallam Yisau Ibrahim, who trades in the commodity at the Ogbeogologo market, Asaba blamed the situation on insufficient supply arising from normal seasonal factors. That of Ose Market, Onitsha, was not different either, as a 100kg bag of onions that earlier attracted N18,000 increased to between N26,000 and N28,000, a 44 percent rise of which many of the traders blamed on high demand. At the Umuahia Main Market, prices of the commodity soared the more, especially with a 100kg bag currently ranging from N25,000 to N26,000 up from N16,000 formerly sold. Madam Uche, who retails the commodity at Umuahia Main Market, connected the hike to abrupt cut in supply due to the closure of all borders of which food items from neighbouring countries are prohibited in to the Nigerian market. For Achau Market, Kaduna, prices of onions also witnessed a slight increase despite the proximity, coupled with the fact that chunk of the produce in the markets emanates from Zaria and some Northern areas; for example, prices of a 100kg bag that previously attracted between N9,500 and N10,000 went up, ranging from N13,000 to 13,800 signifying  a 37 percent increase from the month of August. That of Wuse Market, Abuja, also went up further, particularly with the prices of a 100kg bag of the commodity currently going for between N18,000 and N22,000 up  from N13,500 sold before. But this depends on the specie and the bargaining power of the buyer. A large number of the traders at the Wuse Market, Abuja, blamed the situation to seasonal effect commonly related with the produce. In Oba Market, Benin City, Edo State, prices of a 100kg bag of onions rose further to N26,000 from N18,000 sold in the  month of August. A lady who simply identified herself as Justina, but trades in the commodity at the Oba Market, Benin City, in a chat with our Correspondent linked the hike to unavailability and increased demand. She was however, very hopeful that the prices would certainly decline in its season of abundance approaching next month. Visit to Lafenwa Market, Ogun State, revealed that prices of the onions were still at an upward trend as a bag which formerly went for between N18,500 and N20,000  grew to  between N27,000 and N30,000 of which many of the traders related to shortage in supply from its major sources. At the Bodija Market, Ibadan, prices of the commodity escalated further. For example, a 100kg bag of onions especially the violet type which previously went for between 16,000 and N18,000 soared, currently ranging from N25,000 to N26,000 while the dried ones attracted between N32,000 and N33,000 up from N25,000 initially sold. Mr. Salim Yaqub, who trades the commodity in large scale, connected the hike to scarcity usually associated with seasonal problems. According to him, prices of onions and all other produce are determined by season. In Lagos, visits to popular markets such as Mile 12 and Iddo, indicated that prices of onions were in short supply as only few trucks were sighted offloading the consignment. The onions available were from Zaria, thus making the commodity scarce and expensive due to increased demand. Prices of the commodity currently range from N28,000 to N34,000 up from between N22,000 and N30,000 sold last week. But this depends on the specie and the negotiating power of the customer. The dry ones prices are higher than the moist one and is currently selling within the region of N34,000 and N35,000 from N30,000 it attracted last week. The worst hit are consumers who bought in smaller quantities.

Lagos – Anthony Sani, the Secretary-General of Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Anthony on Saturday said Igbos must develop a winning formula by building bridges across sections of the country of they are serious about producing the President of Nigeria. Speaking in an interview with DAILY INDEPENDENT, Sani said most Igbos are only preoccupied with making money than focusing on strategies to adopt in getting the Presidency. Sani also said it is a wrong assumption for some Nigerians to claim only Igbos have not produced President since the return of democracy in 1999, adding that other ethnic extractions are yet to do so. “Igbos are not the only ethnic extraction that has not produced President of Nigeria since 1999. Nigeria has about 371 ethnic extractions who have qualified people to be president but most of them are yet to do so. “With special reference to the Igbos, I would say it is their inability to develop a winning game plan in a multiparty democracy. “Most Igbos are preoccupied with making money with their faith in limitless fungibility of money. I recall Arthur Nzeribe once said, if money made presidents, there would be no President Obasanjo. I can say the same thing of president Buhari both of whom were sandal-wearing Generals before becoming president. “Multiparty democracy provides for breaking of barriers and building of bridges across sections of the country. What is more, the constitution provides that both popular votes and spread must intersect for anybody to be president. “It is for Igbos to come together and develop their winning game plans in a multiparty democracy instead of playing the victim with jeremiads and being bellicose and percussive. This is because democracy is not a bullfight but a contest of ideas and reasons,” he said.

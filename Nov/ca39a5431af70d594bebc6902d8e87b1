Hurricane Energy PLC said Friday it is “far too early” to determine the success of the well test for the Warwick well in Block 204/30b-4 north of Shetland, Scotland. Responding to “media speculation”, Hurricane said testing for the Warwick well will begin “soon”. “The timing of testing is weather dependent. As such it is far too early to make any conclusions as to the success of the Warwick West well,” the company added. Hurricane said it will provide an update when testing begins and on completion of the testing. Shares in Hurricane Energy were 2.7% higher in London on Friday afternoon at 42.84 pence each.

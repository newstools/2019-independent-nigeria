The governor, however, tacitly admitted he sought medical attention though not as serious as was blown out of proportion by the opposition. According him, ”Yes, I needed to seek medical attention. It was nothing so serious as overblown because it is routine. But on my return, I needed to take some time off to strengthen the attention based on advise. It wasn’t as serious as people blew it. ”But basically, my stay back in Abuja was indeed not a serious period to even rest because I had to attend to a lot of issues that will move the state forward. ”I received in audience a word class Medical Foundation, Medicus International from Germany as I presided over the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for them to build a World class Medical city in Akure.”

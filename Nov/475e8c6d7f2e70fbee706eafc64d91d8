LAGOS – Chairman, Zinox Group, Leo Stan Ekeh has disclosed that budding entrepreneurs and business owners must retain a level of belief in Nigeria in order to scale their business. Ekeh also affirmed that growing a business in Nigeria’s peculiar business environment requires the essential ingredient of a firm faith in the country. He made this disclosure at The Kingdom Summit 2019, an International Marketplace and Leadership Conference organised by the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) at weekend. The event, with the theme – From Business Person to Nation Changer – was held at the premises of the RCCG The King’s Court in Victoria Island, Lagos. “You must not be discouraged by the challenges you face in business today. Also, you must not allow people discourage you with their negative projections. You must have faith in Nigeria in order to grow your business and scale. As a matter of fact, before I started out in business during undergraduate days in India and after my post-graduate in Cork City, I was clear that I was going to return to Nigeria. “Sometimes, I laugh when people say things were better in the past than they are today. When I returned to Nigeria to start up my first company, Task Systems Ltd., the society was completely analogue. The print and publishing industry, which I transitioned to digital publishing, was still relying on the old system of casting metal type at the time. This was why I was determined to create an IT identity for Nigeria. We eventually achieved this through Zinox. “It is on record that the Zinox Group pioneered electronic petrol dispensing pumps, Desktop Publishing and Computer Graphics, INEC Data Capture System, first internationally certified Computer brand – Zinox, pioneered e-Commerce in Africa, amongst other firsts. If we do not have faith, you will not have the mental capacity to research, incubate and achieve products that may add greater impetus to the economy.

Governor Okezie Victor Ikpeazu of Abia State has described his  victory at the Court of Appeal on Saturday as a clear reaffirmation of the mandate given to him and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) by the Abia electorate at the last elections. In his first official reaction to the judgement that revalidated his victory at the Abia State governorship poll, Ikpeazu said people’s mandate in an election is always sacrosanct. The appellate court on Saturday dismissed the appeal filed by Alex Oti, the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) governor candidate in the last election, describing it as lacking in merit. Ikpeazu noted after the judgement was delivered by the three-man panel of judges sitting in Owerri that “for the umpteenth time, the mandate freely given to me by the people of Abia State has received appellate judicial imprimatur,” and therefore thanked God for the victory. Recalling his tortuous judicial journey in defense of his mandate since 2015, Ikpeazu stated that had it not been for the grace of God, he wouldn’t have remained governor till date. He used the opportunity to thank the people of Abia State for remaining steadfast in their belief in the capacity of his administration to improve their lot. The Abia State chief executive specially thanked his legal team led by Wole Olanipekun for their industry and hard work while appreciating the learned justices of the Court of Appeal for “standing strong on the side of the rule of law and constitutionalism.” Observing what he called the “unanimity of the three-man panel with no dissenting voice,” Ikpeazu argued that their decision “lends further credence to the fact that I hold a mandate that is legally impregnable.” The governor renewed his counsel to his opponent to toe the path of political maturity, respect the popular will of the people of Abia State and join hands with him to move the state forward instead of engaging in fruitless litigations, assuring Otti that his doors were wide open to all citizens of the state who are willing to pursue the path of genuine cooperation.

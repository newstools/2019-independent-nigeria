About 250 members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Social Democratic Party (SDP) on Friday defected to the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC) in Iragbiji, Boripe Local Government Area of Osun State. The defectors, led by Alhaji Folorunso Akinola of PDP and Mr. Oni-Osun Adewale of SDP respectively, were received by both Governor Adegboyega Oyetola and the APC state chairman, Prince Gboyega Famodun, and  other members of the party’s state executives. Speaking at the official ‘Declaration and absorption’ of the new opposition members, Akinola said their decision to leave their former parties for APC was informed by the pro-masses policies and programmes of the state government. He said he and other members of the opposition in the council had seen the need to join hands with the administration of Governor Oyetola to move Osun State forward. Oyetola, in his remarks, expressed delight at the decision taken by the members of the opposition parties to defect to the APC. He reaffirmed his commitment to good governance, adding that his administration would not rest on its oars in investing in things that would make life meaningful and worthwhile for the people of the state.

LAGOS – Chief Charles Idahosa, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has said the Igbos cannot achieve presidency in 2023 because his party lacked presence in any of the five states in the South-East. Speaking in an interview with Sunday Independent, Idahosa said the Igbos had themselves to blame by ignoring President Muhammadu Buhari’s advice to vote for APC in the last presidential election to brighten their chances in 2023. The former Political Adviser to Comrade Adams Oshiomhole said he foresees a situation where the Igbos will vote massively for Atiku Abubakar, presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2019 general elections if he decides to contest in 2023. Idahosa, who blamed the Igbos for abandoning the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), the party founded by the late Dim Chukwuemeka Odimegwu-Ojukwu, said they would get the vice-presidency slot again in 2023. “Forget the Igbos! They have shot themselves in the leg. It is a very funny demand. Why will anyone want to give Igbos presidency when there is no APC in the zone at all?  The only party that could have given Igbos presidency is the APC. “Buhari told them, but they decided to vote PDP. Now, from all indications, they will rather support Atiku for presidency again because the vice- president position will still go the South-East. “I see Atiku running again because the 2019 presidential election is the nearest Atiku has come. So, I don’t think the Igbos deserve presidency because if they do, they ought to have planned properly. The late Emeka Ojukwu gave them APGA, but they threw it away. So, under which party will they get presidency?” he asked.

The campaign is running throughout November across print media and out-of-home sites, featuring the slogan “Brewed, Served & Enjoyed with Pride”. The brand said it aims to “bring London Pride to the forefront of its fans’ minds and generate excitement in cask ale”, reaching more than 2.5 million adult consumers.

Minister for Investment and Economic Development, Jerzy Kwieciński, said he expects Poland to reach EU average for household sizes by 2030. “The gap has shrunk significantly. I’m sure that in 10 years we will reach the EU average,” said Mr Kwieciński. The Minister pointed out that the average number of flats per 1000 residents increased in Poland from 363 in 2014 to 380 in 2018. The current EU average is 435 flats. According to Mr Kwieciński, in 2015 there were 147,000 flats under construction, while this year the number is predicted to reach 200,000. The Ministry also announced plans to simplify the building code. “We want things to be simpler and quicker. It is important for us to simplify the investment process in our country. That’s why we decided to introduce changes to the construction law,” said the Minister. The draft legislation would decrease the number of documents an investor has to submit for a building permit. “These changes will serve freedom, they will serve to speed up the investments which help citizens, but also help in implementing our government’s programmes,” said Artur Soboń, deputy Minister for Investment and Economic Development. The Ministry claims the changes will help connecting new buildings to the electricity grid and other utilities. The bill will also legalise buildings constructed in violation of the construction code, on the condition that their owners complete the necessary procedures. A building permit will no longer be required for ticket machines, vending machines and self-pickup lockers. The law also includes a tightening of the fire code.

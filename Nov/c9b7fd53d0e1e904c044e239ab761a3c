LAGOS – Team Nigeria will camp in Kisarazu City of Japan to prepare for the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo. This follows a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed by the Ministry of Youth and Sports Development with Japanese Mayor of Kisarazu City, Yoshokuni Watanabe in Abuja.. The Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Mr. Sunday Dare said on the occasion, that the MOU was in line with the ministry’s direction of early preparation for tournaments. “About three weeks ago, Nigeria started in earnest, its Olympic Games preparations. We had waited for the completion of the Doha Athletics Championship before officially starting our preparations. “We have less than nine months and where the pre-games camping will take place is critical to our preparations for Tokyo 2020. “I’m glad that we are able to follow up on the initiatives of previous Ministers and Ambassadors who have acted rightly on behalf of this country”, the sports minister said. The minister has stressed that the country will focus only on sports in which the country had competitive advantage, stating that next year’s Olympics would not be the usual jamboree witnessed in the recent past as efforts were on to ensure the country returned from Tokyo with medals. The 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo will run from July 24 to August 9 and Team Nigeria is one of the countries that will participate at the Games. It will be recalled that since the nation made its debut in 1952, Nigerian athletes have appeared in every edition of the Summer Olympic Games, with the exception of the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal because of the African boycott. At the Tokyo 2020, Team Nigeria athletes are expected to feature in wrestling, weightlifting, basketball, judo among other sports.

ADO-EKITI – The Director General of the Buhari/Osinbajo Campaign Council in Ekiti State in the 2019 presidential election, Dr. Olusegun Osinkolu, has bemoaned the deplorable state of federal roads in the state. In a statement in Ado Ekiti on Wednesday, the All Progressives Congress (APC), said virtually all the federal roads in the state need rehabilitation , urging the Minister of Works, Mr. Babatunde Raji Fashola to prioritise Ekiti in the rehabilitation agenda of the government , in this dry season. The APC leader appealed to the Federal Government to give Governor Kayode Fayemi clearance to rehabilitate some of these roads, in view of the new guidelines stopping the states from undertaking construction works on Federal roads. Osinkolu said the people of the state voted massively for President Muhammadu Buhari in the last presidential election owing to their unwavering belief that the Federal Government would reciprocate the gesture with democracy dividends. “Ekiti State has one of the worst federal roads in the state. Virtually all the existing federal roads need attention either through outright reconstruction or rehabilitation to ease transportation. “The Ado-Akure road, Ado-Aramoko-Efon, Ado-Ijan- Ikare, Ado-Ifaki-Otun and the worst and the most dangerous among them is Ifaki-Oye- Ikole-Omuo road.”

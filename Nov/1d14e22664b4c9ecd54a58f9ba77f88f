UGHELLI – Delta State Governor, Senator Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, has been commended by Delta Visionary Leaders Forum (DVLF) for the appointment of Pastor Austin Igbine as member of Delta State Board of Internal Revenue (DBIR) Chairman of DVLF, Hon. Ejovwoke Obiaguke, who made the commendation on behalf of the group in a statement, said the appointment of Pastor Igbine was in line with Okowa’s drive to increase the internal revenue base of the state towards actualising the ‘Stronger Delta’ vision. The group described the governor as a focused and pragmatic leader who had turned the fortunes of Delta State around for the better in the last four years, saying that injecting fresh blood into his government, which he said was a breath of fresh air, was a right step in the right direction. DVLF said the appointment of Igbine as a member of DBIR was a good omen for Deltans, especially the people of Delta South Senatorial District, as he had demonstrated times without number, that he was a true son of Isoko and Delta South in his previous political positions. The group appealed to Deltans to continue with their support for the Okowa administration because he meant well for the people of the state with his projects spread all over.

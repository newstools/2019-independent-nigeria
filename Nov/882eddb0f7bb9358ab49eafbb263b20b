The Ministry of Power has started the recovery and reactivation of some generation plants at Afam Power stations to restore the plants to full generating capacity, the Minister of Power Engr Sale Mamman has said. It would be recalled that only one of the five plants is currently working with an output of only 270 MW out of Afam installed capacity of about 1000MW of electricity. Engr Mamman , who made the disclosure to journalists during an inspection visit to Afam, stated that the Power project was still under the privatisation process, and that the government had approved funds to carry out major repairs on some of the plants. He also disclosed that some of the issues affecting the project have already been presented to Federal Executive Council for deliberations and approval. Engr Sale Mamman commended Afam community for loyalty and support while promising that they would be carried along in the privatisation process of the company. He also disclosed that the rehabilitation of the Afam road has also been taken up with the Federal government. Receiving the minister, the managing director and chief executive officer, Engr O.N. Obademi said the major problem confronting the Afam power project is the paucity of funds, adding that it has not received a single budgetary allocation or receipts since 2012. He revealed that of the five plants installed at various times in Afam only Afam IV was functional with an output of 110MW, while Afam V, installed in 2012 with capacity to generate 276MW was being overhauled.

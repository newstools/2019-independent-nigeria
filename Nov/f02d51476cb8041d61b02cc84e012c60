Aaron Connolly, Brighton & Hove Albion forward has recovered from a groin injury and will be available for Saturday’s English Premier League (EPL) match at table-toppers Liverpool. The Republic of Ireland international picked up the injury during Brighton’s 3-1 loss at Manchester United on November 10 and missed international games against New Zealand and Denmark earlier this month. “Aaron Connolly is back in the squad and training now,” Brighton manager Graham Potter told reporters. The 19-year-old became the first teenager to start a Premier League game for Brighton when he featured in the 4-0 defeat by champions Manchester City in August, going on to appear in nine league games so far this season. He entered the record books again as their first teenage player to score in the competition, notching a brace in their 3-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur in October.

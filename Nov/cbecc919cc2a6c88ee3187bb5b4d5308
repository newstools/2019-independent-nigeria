Overwhelmed at the ongoing installations on the 650,000bpd capacity Dangote Petroleum refinery and petrochemical projects, the Kano Professionals Forum, who visited the sites in Lagos, have described the investments as huge and mind boggling. The forum is a congregation of men who have attained the peak of their various professional callings and have dedicated their experience to helping the society. Mr. Munzali Jibril, Leader of the team, a Professor Emeritus, who spoke on behalf of the forum members said: “The Dangote refinery and fertiliser project is incredible. It’s unbelievable. The scale of the two projects is simply mind boggling. “It is consistent with what we know about the vision of this company. It is always aspiring to do the biggest in the world, and not to be complacent, once target is achieved then they set a new target.” Mr. Jibril added: “As a people who come from the same state as Alhaji Aliko Dangote, we are very proud of his vision, of his achievements and the way he has been growing the company from strength to strength. We can only pray for more of the divine grace that has seen him this far to be bestowed upon him.” Speaking on how the refinery and petrochemical projects will help the Nigerian economy, he said: “Once the refinery project is completed, for instance, it will be more than twice greater than the entire installed capacity of all the existing refineries in the country. “It really makes you think that if an individual can do this, what have our leaders been doing? It is also gratifying to note that all our domestic needs will be met by this factory, and that there will be excess capacity which will be exported and foreign exchange will be earned.

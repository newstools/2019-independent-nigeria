With the determination of the Federal Government not to re-open surrounding borders so as to prevent smugglers from bringing in all manners of expired commodities including food items such as rice and frozen foods into the Nigerian market, prices of these food items have continued to skyrocket. However, despite the enforcement by the Nigerian Customs, foreign rice and frozen foods still find their way into the country but at very exorbitant rates. Even then, it is difficult to get foreign rice to buy as most traders do not display it for fear of being seized by men of the Nigerian Customs Service. The ban has therefore, created scarcity of the food items as the demand seemed to be more than supply. Consequently consumers have to make do with the local rice. However, the situation has not really favoured the common folks as local rice merchant seize the opportunity to hike the prices significantly such that affordability has become a big struggle to many. Consumers who have penchant for foreign items still patronise imported rice despite the amount. Traders are also affected adversely as a large number of them can no longer afford to sustain their normal purchases because of the high cost. Visits to various markets across some states indicated that prices of local rice had been on the rise since the closure of borders, a situation which left consumers with no choice than to lament. Prices of local rice went up by over 10 percent from October to November 14, 2019 owing to scarcity. Checks at the Wuse Market, Abuja, revealed that prices of a 50kg bag of local rice sold for between N16,500 and N17,000 last month grew further, currently going for between N17,500 and N18,500 depending on the quality and the bargaining power of the customer. few shops that had foreign rice sold it for between N24,000 and N25,000 from N19,000 sold initially. Mr. Ibeh Afam, who trades in grains at the Wuse Market, Abuja, blamed the hike on insufficient supply as a result of increased demand. For Achau Market, Kaduna, the situation was similar with prices of a 50kg bag of local rice currently selling for between N17,000 and N17,500 up from N16,000 sold previously while that of foreign rice attracted between N19,800 to N20,000 That of Ogbeogologo Market, Asaba, Delta State, soared the more especially when compared with what was sold earlier. For example, a 50kg bag of local rice sold for N18,000 in September went up, currently ranging from N19,500 to N24,000 depending on the quality. Likewise, the foreign rice, as a 50kg which previously went for  N23,000  soared, selling within the region of N26,500 and N27,000 depending on the haggling power of the customer. Many of the traders at the Ogbeogologo Market, Asaba, linked the situation to closure of adjoining borders by the Federal Government without making adequate preparation for the masses. At the Ose Market, Onitsha, prices of local and foreign rice were on the high side with a 50kg bag of local rice  going for between N18,500 and N22,000 against N17,000 earlier sold, signifying a 12 percent increase. That of foreign rice also grew to between N24,000 and N25,000 from N19,000 initially sold. Mr. Odidong Emma, who retails the commodity at the Ose Market, Onitsha, linked the persistent hike on local rice to abrupt cut in supply while border closure was responsible for that of foreign rice. The same could be mentioned for that Oba Market, Benin City, Edo State, as prices of the commodity rose further. For example, prices of a 50kg bag of local rice that were previously sold  for N17,000 escalated to between N18,500 to N23,000, depending on the quality, a situation which many of the traders attributed to severe scarcity. That of foreign rice was a no go area as few traders that had them in stock sold a 50kg bag for between N28,000 and N30,000 up from N19,500 previously sold. At the Lafenwa Market, Ogun State, prices of local rice were still at an upward trend as a 50kg bag increased the more to between N18,000 and N19,500 from N16,500 initially sold as well as imported rice, currently ranging from N23,500 to N25,000. Mr. Sulaiman Afolabi, a trader at the Lafenwa Market, Ogun State, said unavailability was responsible for the hike. This is just as Osuji, another trader, shared the same view but principally blamed the hike on the insensitivity of the Federal Government towards the welfare of the masses. For Bodija Market, the trend was not different as prices of a 50kg bag of local rice rose further to between N18,500 and N20,000 from N17,800 sold in the previous month. That of imported rice, although scarce, attracted between N25,000 and N26,000 up from N22,000 earlier sold. Many of the traders linked the situation to unavailability arising from a drastic shortfall in supply. For Lagos, the situation was not different as visits to popular markets such as Mile 12, Daleko, Ogba, and Oshodi revealed that prices of the commodity had skyrocketed further. For example, prices of a 50kg bag of local rice formerly sold for between N17,500 and N19,000 increased, currently selling between N18,500 and N22,000, depending on the quality. The foreign rice also grew further to between N27,000 and N28,000 up from N24,000 sold before. Findings also showed that majority of consumers can no longer afford to buy a bag of rice but instead had to go for small measures such as ‘derica’ or paint bucket owing to the exorbitant price. The situation saw consumers lamenting about the high cost of living as they were left with no choice but to appeal to government at all levels to subsidise the cost of production to assuage their sufferings.

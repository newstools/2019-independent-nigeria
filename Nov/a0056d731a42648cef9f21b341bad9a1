Abuja – The former chairman Senate Committee on Local and Foreign Debt in the 8th Senate, Senator Shehu Sani, has said they turned down the $30 billion loan request to save Nigeria from sinking into the dark gully of a perpetual debt trap. He said that the action was aimed at averting a situation where the country would be recolonised by creditor banks. He disclosed this in a statement on Friday in Abuja while reacting to the loan request submitted by President Muhammadu Buhari to the National Assembly. Sani said the current escalation of borrowing would plunge the country into debt slavery and move us from landlords to tenants. Sani said, “They will always tell you that even America is borrowing and I don’t know how rational is it to keep on borrowing because another country is borrowing. “We turned down the FG loan request for $30 billion to save Nigeria from sinking into the dark gully of a perpetual debt trap. We don’t want our country to be recolonised by creditor banks.” He added that the action to reject the request was in good faith and act of patriotism. The president had on Thursday re-sent the $29.96 billion 2016-2018 external borrowing plan to the Senate for its consideration and approval amidst condemnation from Nigerians.

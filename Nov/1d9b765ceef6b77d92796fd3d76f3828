Palestinian Foreign Ministry on Monday congratulated Jordan on raising its flag and marking full sovereignty of Baqoura and Ghumar on the borders with Israel. “We reiterate the position of our people and leadership in standing by the brotherly Jordanian nation, and voices high appreciation of Jordan’s courageous positions that always support our people’s rights,” the ministry said in a statement. On Sunday, Jordan declared the end of a lease agreement with Israel and prevented Israelis from entering the territory, NAN reports via Xinhua. The agreement, which allowed Israeli farmers to work in the borderline area for 25 years, was part of the 1994 peace deal between Jordan and Israel. In Oct. 2018, Jordan officially informed Israel of its decision not to renew an agreement that leases part of its lands to Israel.

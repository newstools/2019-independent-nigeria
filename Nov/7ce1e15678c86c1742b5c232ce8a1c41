Arsene Wenger is back in football. The Frenchman has spent the last year-and-a-half working as a pundit for various media outlets, having left his position as Arsenal boss in the summer of 2018. But after links with numerous other clubs, namely Bayern Munich most recently, Wenger has decided that he is done in the dugout and has instead taken up a new position at FIFA. Wenger has been unveiled world football’s governing body’s new Chief of Global Football Development. According to FIFA’s official website, Wenger will be “chiefly responsible for overseeing and driving the growth and development of the sport for both men and women around the world”. He said: “I very much look forward to taking on this extremely important challenge, not only because I have always been interested in analysing football from a broader perspective but also because FIFA’s mission as world football’s governing body is truly global. “I believe that the new FIFA we have seen emerging in recent years has the sport itself at the very heart of its objectives and is determined to develop the game in its many different components. I know I can contribute to this objective and will put all my energy into this.” And the Arsenal fans, it seems, could not be happier for him. AFC BAM  Arsene Wenger ruler of world football

This is actually an amazing appointment. Wenger has a lot of respect globally and FIFA doesn’t (with all of the corruption). This actually might be a perfect fit. 15

Hurts that we will most likely not see Arséne Wenger manage a game again. But then, the man is larger than life & bigger than football. So happy to see him happy doing what he loves! Football needs you and welcomes you back le Prof ♥️#OneArseneWenger #Legend 58

The interesting thing now will be to see how the Arsenal legend can change football from within in his new role.

Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr has strongly hinted that as many as six young players are in contention to be named in the starting line-up when his side tackle Benin in an Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifier on Wednesday evening, according to Goal.com reports. Leganes’ Chidozie Awaziem is battling Ola Aina for a starting spot at right-back, while Samuel Chukwueze, Joe Aribo, Samuel Kalu and Victor Osimhen will be given a chance against the Squirrels provided they prove their fitness in the last training session on Tuesday evening. Quizzed about the young players likely to start vs Benin, Rohr told reporters including allnigeriasoccer.com: ”I don’t know how many young players will start because I have to see how they are after the travelling yesterday. “What is sure is that we will have at least Awaziem or Ola, we will have Aribo if he is ready but he is not U23, we will have Osimhen who played on Saturday night, yesterday he was okay so I think he’ll be ready. “We have Chukwueze, he played only 45 minutes in his club so it is possible to start the game. Kalu played on Friday which is good so he has a chance to start.” As for Nantes’ Moses Simon, Rohr suggested that the winger may be rested as he has played too many games for his French club this season. “Simon Moses played a lot, all the games for Nantes, but losing all of them, the four last games. Perhaps he needs a little bit of rest and play the second game, it is possible. “We will check in the training how many of them will be ready, but I like to play with young and fresh players, this is our football – go forward to attack, to score the goals and to be all the time able to play our football with one, two, three touches with quick strikers. “The young people are able to recover quickly, that’s why I am not afraid of the fitness for tomorrow.”

Two North Korean men suspected of killing 16 crew members on board their squid fishing boat have been repatriated to the isolated country they had tried to flee because they were deemed too dangerous to be given asylum, officials in Seoul have said. The men in their 20s admitted that they and another man had killed the vessel’s captain because of his harsh treatment of the crew as they sailed in the waters off the Russian coast. They then killed the protesting crew members afterwards one at a time and dumped the bodies overboard, Yonhap news agency reported.

Two fishermen from the secretive country who killed their fellow crew members to escape to the south have been handed back to Pyongyang. One of the trio was arrested when he returned to the north, spurring the other two to flee on their boat. The men were seized by the South Korean navy after they had breached a maritime border with the south. The BBC reported that South Korea usually grants asylum to defectors, but the nature of the crimes the pair were accused of meant that authorities considered them to be too dangerous to stay. The pair said they wanted to resettle in South Korea, but South Korean authorities determined they only wanted to avoid North Korean arrest. “The government decided to expel them as they had committed grave, non-political crimes such as murder and were not subject to our protection under the law,” South Korea’s Unification Ministry spokesperson, Lee Sang-min said at a press briefing, according to Yonhap.

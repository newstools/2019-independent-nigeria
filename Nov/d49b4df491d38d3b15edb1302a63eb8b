ABUJA – Rt. Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, Speaker, House of Representatives, has tasked the national leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Youth Wing to come up with a comprehensive agenda for the Nigerian youths. The Speaker said the House would be willing to key into the agenda once the APC youth wing is able to bring it up, noting that the House recognises the importance of the youth. Gbajabiamila, said he believed in youth inclusiveness in governance, noting that the Nigerian youths have great potential that if well harnessed, could help the country a great deal. The speaker stated these when the APC Youth Wing led by the National Youth Leader, Sadiq Abubakar, paid him a courtesy call in his office on Tuesday. He said, “I thank you for finding it worthy of visiting the people’s House. As you said, 60 to 70 per cent of the population comprises youth, so when you come together, you’ll do a lot of things. If we don’t forget, it was the youths that came together to put in the first black president in America. History was made.”

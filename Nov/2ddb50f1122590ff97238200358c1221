LAGOS – Forum of State Chairmen of the All Progressives Congress (APC), and Forum of Non National Working Committee, National Executive Council (NEC) members have passed a vote of confidence on the national chairman of the party, Adams Oshiomhole. Both forum, in a statement on Saturday, also urged aggrieved members in the party to stop attacking the national chairman as advised by President Muhammadu Buhari at the just concluded NEC meeting of the party. While describing the statement by the members, which called on the Oshiomhole to resign, as laughable and uncalled for, the two forum passed a vote of confidence on the national chairman, admonishing aggrieved members to be loyal to the party rather than allowing themselves to be used by desperate politicians. The statement, signed by Ali Bukar Dalori, Chairman Forum of APC State Chairmen and Nelson Alapa, Chairman Forum of Non-NWC NEC members, said, “We want to state categorically that we held a very successful NEC meeting today where our dear President, Muhammadu Buhari stressed the need for party discipline and supremacy of the party. “The meaning is that our party members must subject themselves to the organs of the party particularly when they are angry with any issue so as to find solution to the problems. But we have found out that some of our colleagues have refused to subject themselves to these organs rather embarking on activities capable of destabilizing the party, which our President kicked against today. “This statement by few of these our colleagues is ill-intended because if actually they have issues with the party, they would have raised it today at NEC where Mr. President and other leaders of the party were seated.

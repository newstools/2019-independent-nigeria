YENAGOA – Monday Bubou-Obolo, the Speaker, Bayelsa State House of Assembly, has denied reports of his purported defection from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC). He described his purported defection as “a lie from the pit of hell and the height of desperation from the opposition party, APC.” Bubou-Obolo, who spoke on his reported defection on Tuesday in Yenagoa, said that he remained a true and committed member of the PDP. The speaker urged the party supporters, particularly in Southern Ijaw local Government Area, to discountenance the “fake news” as the PDP would defeat the APC in the governorship poll. “There was never any time that I imagined or contemplated the idea let alone defecting to the APC,” he said. Also, the chairman of Southern Ijaw LGA, Nigeria Kia, dismissed reports purporting that he had defected from the PDP to the APC.

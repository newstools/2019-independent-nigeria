ABUJA – A steel manufacturer has said the closure of Nigerian land borders is yielding positive impact on the steel industry as local steel manufacturers can now sell their stocks and service their bank loans. Dr. Kamorudeen Yusuf, the chief executive officer, Kam Holdings Ltd and the Chairman Basic Metal, Iron & Steel Fabricated Products told journalists in an interview in Abuja that the closure of the steel is also blocking huge financial leakages’ that otherwise would have been lost to smugglers. “I can tell you that between 2016 and t July 2019, Nigeria has lost over 2 million tones of steel” adding that the value is worth over N504bn, about $1.7bn.So we have seen a lot of positive impact on the border closure, we are selling our stock and we are now able to service our loans from the banks” he stated. Dr. Yusuf, who backed the border closure also noted that a lot of steel companies in Nigeria were shutting, and throwing thousands of youths into the job market due to activities of smugglers. “I can tell you that the best thing that has ever happened to Nigeria is the border closure. The border closure will enable us realize ourselves as a nation. We are currently losing huge employment due to smuggling of steel into Nigeria. We are not getting employments for our youth” he noted.

Preparations for the maiden National Advertising Conference, have reached top gear, the Advertising Practitioners Council of Nigeria (APCON), organisers of the conference has disclosed. APCON disclosed this in Lagos at a joint press briefing it jointly addressed with representatives of the various industry sectoral groups, saying the occasion, the biggest ever advertising event in the country’s history, would hold at Abuja’s Transcorp Hilton Hotel, between November 25 and 27. Mrs. Ijedi Iyoha, APCON’s Scting Registrar, who spoke at the press briefing, said the national advertising conference would have as theme, “Advertising in the post-digital age: The profession, the business and Nigeria’s socio-economic development.” Iyoha said the conference would draw the attention of the government, policy makers, business community and the public to the importance of advertising. “The National Advertising Conference is an initiative of the Advertising Practitioners Council of Nigeria, which identified the need for the conference as one way of raising the professional standing of advertising practice in Nigeria and compelling the attention of the government, business leaders and policy makers as well as the general public to the impact and value of advertising. “You are no doubt familiar with the fact that the Advertising industry in Nigeria is structured around sectoral associations which, apart from self-regulating their member-organisations, cater to the interests of organisations which belong to their respective specialised areas of practice. “All of these associations have embraced the National Advertising conference and have their members represented in the Conference Planning Committee,” she said.

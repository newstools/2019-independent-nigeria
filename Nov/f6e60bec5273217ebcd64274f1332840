ADO-EKITI – Two Secondary School Students have been confirmed dead by the Police in a failed swimming expedition in Ado-Ekiti. It was gathered that the incident occurred at the popular Ureje River Ado-Ekiti on Friday. The victims were said to be students of Ado Grammar school, few metres to the river. Police Public Relations Officer, Ekiti Command, DSP Caleb Ikechukwu, said the corpses of the dead students had been deposited in the morgue. “We learnt the students went to the river to swim and got drowned. Their bodies had been taken to the mortuary,” he said. Ikechukwu said other students who were part of the swimming expedition would help the police in conducting investigation into the pathetic incident. DAILY INDEPENDENT gathered on Sunday that the two students died at a deeper portion of Ureje River which stretched from Ajilosun and flowed down to Odo Ado region of the capital city. He said about seven students were reported to have scaled the fence when academic works were ongoing to swim in the river, where two of them were drowned. “The academic works were ongoing when they left school. They went to the deeper side of Ureje river to swim and two of them were trapped in the mud and they died. One of the survivors said four of them jumped into the river but before long he sensed that the two victims were no longer floating on the water. “Those on the river cliff had to run to a farmer working around the river. It was the man who called on some swimmers farming in the area to come and rescue two that were still afloat before bringing out those that were already dead,” he said. The source added that the farmers later ran to the school compound at about noon to report the incident to the teachers. The development was said to have evoked cries and wailings among the staff and students.

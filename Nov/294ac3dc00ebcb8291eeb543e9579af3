In the week two matches that went down the country last weekend, it was mixed fortunes for both Rangers International and Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries (MFM) Football Club of Lagos. Playing before their fans at the Soccer Temple, Agege, the Olukoya Boys were on the verge of losing their first home game of the season when FC IfeanyiUbah led early in their game through Christian Nnaji in the sixth minute. But the Lagos side piled pressure on their guests and deservedly got the equaliser towards the tail end of the first half when Adeniji Kabir found the back of the net. Even though it was the same draw for Rangers at the newly promoted Adamawa United, the Flying Antelopes led in Yola before the hosts rallied to equalise. Rangers led through Dauda Madaki in the 57th minute and the home side leveled in the 74th minute via Sadiq Lawan. But on Sunday, both MFM and Rangers will go head to head at the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium, Enugu. The last time both sides met was in 2018 during the match-day 18 of the game at the same Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium and the match ended goalless. Meanwhile, of the five times both sides have met since 2016, Rangers won two times, MFM won one while two ended in draws. MFM are joint third on the log with FC IfeanyiUbah on four points from two games while the Flying Antelopes are twelfth on the log with a point from one game after staying the match-day one due to continental engagement.

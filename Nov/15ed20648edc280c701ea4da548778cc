Abuja – The Federal Government has been urged to reduce Value Added Tax (VAT) to two percent and also to give five years tax holiday for pioneer status on indigenous renewable energy businesses in the country. Godwin Uyi Ojo, the Executive Director of Environmental Rights Action/Friends of the Earth Nigeria (ERA/FoEN), who made this call in Abuja, noted that access to clean modern energy services was an enormous challenge facing the African continent because energy is fundamental for socio-economic development and poverty reduction. According to him, “there is need to urgently decentralise energy protection and supply to allow government, civil society groups, communities and the private sector to participate in the energy sector supply chain.” Calling for elimination of high tariffs in renewable energy, Ojo said, “the diverse sources of tax is worrisome with five percent stamp duty, five percent on solar panels, 25 percent on batteries and inverters and other sundry taxes, which raises the tax burden to about 30 percent on products. “We strongly propose that lowering taxes on renewable energy products will go a long way in the promotion of energy access for all. Therefore, the proposed hike on the Value Added Tax (VAT) from five percent to 7.5 percent in Nigeria, if at all implemented should not be extended to solar lighting equipment and clean energy cook stoves.” He noted that across Africa, energy demands outstripped supply, adding that the situation is worse in Nigeria. “In Nigeria, about 70 percent of the 200 million people depend solely on fuel wood for energy for heating and cooking,” he said. The Civil Society Organisation, has, however, implored the National Assembly to make laws for more relax fiscal policies for renewable energy projects in the country.

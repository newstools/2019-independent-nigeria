Lagos -Elder statesman and the Second Republic lawmaker, Junaid Mohammed on Wednesday said the Federal Government should ignore the condition given by Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) for returning to the country. Kanu who recently lost his mother, Ugoeze Nnenne Kanu and is seeking to return to Nigeria for the funeral had said that he was ready to face trial if his safety would be guaranteed by the court. However, speaking in a chat, Junaid said Kanu who committed a criminal offence by jumping bail has no right to give the federal government any condition for his return to the county to face trial. “First and foremost, who is he? What is IPOB itself? One, he jumped bail which is a criminal offence. Now he is saying his mother is dead and he must be allowed to come home”.
“He is now giving the federal government conditions for him to return to the country. Let him burn to ashes and go to hell”.
“I don’t know why the media is giving unnecessary coverage and attention to scoundrels who are just agitators whipping up sentiments to destabilise the country”.

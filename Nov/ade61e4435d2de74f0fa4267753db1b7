Yola – Governor Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri of Adamawa State on Wednesday announced the demotion of the head of the civil service and many permanent secretaries with immediate effect as new reforms take place in the state. Fintiri took the decision when he received the report of the Technical Committee for Evaluation of the Civil Service in Yola. All permanent secretaries who were not on level 17 before their appointments were dropped to their former grade levels. A group had urged the incoming administration to investigate the appointment of 35 permanent secretaries by the Bindow government. A statement by Governor Fintiri said the Adamawa State government would also gradually phase out the office of the deputy permanent secretary as the office is not enshrined in the scheme of the civil service. He expressed worry that the civil service in the state had been bastardised to favour a few, adding that his administration would do all it could to restore the glory of the scheme. The governor also directed that the embargo on employment be partially lifted, promising that the government would soon recruit young talents in areas of needs. He said a committee would soon be constituted to come up with a white paper based on the recommendations of the technical committee for subsequent implementation. He thanked members of the committee for a thorough job, describing them as “competent and experienced hands”. Speaking earlier, Benson Jailani, chairman of the technical committee, said that they carried out a thorough investigation to bring out factual reports and recommendations. Jailani advised the government to ensure full implementation of the committee’s recommendations to sanitise the state’s civil service for efficiency.

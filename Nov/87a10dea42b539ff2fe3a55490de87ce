Nine of the seafarers were kidnapped off Cotonou on a Norwegian-flagged ship, named MV Bonita on Saturday, while four were kidnapped on Monday aboard a Greek oil tanker named Elka Aristotle off Lome. The Norwegian ship owner, J.J. Ugland, said the vessel was boarded by armed pirates while at anchor before the kidnap, while the remaining crew notified local authorities, that the vessel docked at the port city of Cotonou later on Saturday. The ship was carrying a cargo of gypsum, a mineral commonly used as fertilizer. Citing safety reasons, the Norwegian ship owner did not reveal the crew’s nationalities or how many had avoided capture. “The Ugland Emergency Response Team are handling this situation as per contingency plans, and they are in contact with relevant authorities. The families of the crew members have been contacted and will be kept informed by Ugland,” the company said in its terse statement released on Sunday. With regards to the abduction on the Greek tanker, authorities said two of the four kidnapped crew members are Filipinos, one is Greek and one is Georgian.

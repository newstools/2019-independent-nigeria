Manuel Burga, the former Peru football supremo who escaped judicial punishment in the FIFAGate scandal, has been hit with a life ban from football even so by FIFA. The ethics commission of the world governing body has acted, nearly two years after Burga was cleared on a corruption charge in a New York court in December 2017, after the scandal which shook FIFA to its core and resulted in more than 40 US indictments for senior international officials. Life bans have also been imposed by FIFA on former CONMEBOL general secretaries Eduardo Deluca and José Luis Meiszner. The latter was also a former GS of the Argentinian federation. All three were fined CHF 1m though the sum is academic and is not expected to be either repaid or reclaimed. Burga was released by the US judicial system in December 2017 when the one charge laid against him in a joint trial with Brazilian Jose Maria Marin and Paraguayan Juan Angel Napout was deemed not proven after the jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict. The same trial led to jail terms for Jose Maria Marin, former president of the Brazilian CBF, and Juan Angel Napout, ex-president of South American governing body CONMEBOL. Burga, who did crosswords and read historical fiction during the court deliberations, flew home to Peru after the end of the case despite US prosecutors’ insistence that they remained determined to pursue him over further charges.

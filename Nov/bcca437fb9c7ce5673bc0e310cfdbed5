The Development Bank of Nigeria (DBN) is partnering with the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) to explore ways to build the capacity of Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and support them in enlisting on the floor of the exchange. Speaking during the closing gong ceremony at the Exchange, Tony Okpanachi, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), DBN, explained that the proposed collaboration with the NSE would involve sourcing or prospecting for MSME companies. Okpanachi added that the collaboration was line with the NSE’s objective of assisting MSMEs to become listed companies in the stock market. He added that the bank was working with them to build their capacity as well as collaborate with them to make an impact in that segment. He said: “We would explore ways of working effectively with NSE on how we can make impact in the Micro Small and Medium Enterprises in terms of capital raising and equity. “The Development Bank of Nigeria is a wholesale institution but a lot of MSMEs require equity to function and grow optimally. Equally, this partnership is in line with the NSE’s objective of trying to bring MSMEs to the stock market.” There are lots of interests in the MSMEs segment of the economy, but many entrepreneurs see cost and the disclosure of their financial record as an infringement of their ownership. The NSE has come up with a lot of initiatives to ameliorate these challenges and this should encourage MSMEs. Okpanachi further revealed that DBN has plans of getting listed on the exchange in the long term so as to raise capital beyond its current funding. He said: “Ultimately, our long-term plan is to be able to list on the NSE. This is not immediate on the horizon, but in the long term, there will an opportunity for us to raise capital beyond the current funding we have at the moment.”

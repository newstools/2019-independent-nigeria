The German airline’s chief executive, Carsten Spohr, called on trade union Ufo for a new round of talks in the dispute over pay and conditions. Further action threatened Ufo spokesman Nicoley Baublies said the union was open to discussions but not to ending  the two-day strike. “If the talks don’t work out, we will have to announce on Monday that there will be more strikes,” Baublies told reporters at Munich airport.

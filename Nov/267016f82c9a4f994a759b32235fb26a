North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ordered an artillery firing drill near the disputed border in the sea off the western coast, state-run media reported Monday, prompting a protest from South Korea’s military. The images of Kim surrounded by soldiers and examining a strategic map on a camouflaged observation post came amid rising tensions on the divided peninsula as nuclear talks with the United States show no public signs of revival. The drill occurred on the Chagrin islet as Kim made an unannounced inspection of a “defense detachment on the western front,” according to the Korean Central News Agency. “He indicated the target for Gun 2 of the coastal artillery company on combat duty and gave an order to fire,” KCNA said, adding that the troops “fully showed their gun firing skills they cultivated in their day-to-day training to delight the Supreme Leader.”

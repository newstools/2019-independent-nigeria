Super Eagles’ coach, Gernot Rohr has thrown a bait of instant promotion to the senior national team for players in the Under-23 squad, should they do well at this month’s African championship in Egypt. Although Rohr stated that he was only at the team’s camp in Ismailia, Egypt on a ‘solidarity visit’ to boost their morale ahead of their opening match against Cote d’Ivoire, which also serves as qualifiers for the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan, he went on to hint at vast opportunities for outstanding players in the team. He stated categorically that there are chances of promotion to the senior national team for any of the lads that do well during the championship, where they play Cote d’Ivoire, Zambia and South Africa in Group B. DAILY INDEPENDENT gathered that while addressing the players at their Mercure Hotel abode in Ismaila, Rohr urged them to believe fully in their abilities individually and collectively, which he reckoned is the best approach they can employ in making Nigeria proud and gain spots in the senior national team. “I’m here on a solidarity visit. This team is full of potential and I will be here to watch your first game against Cote d’Ivoire on Saturday. “ I hope you will give all your best to make sure the team achieves its aim in this AFCON U23 tournament. I believe some of you will join me at the Super Eagles someday”, he said.

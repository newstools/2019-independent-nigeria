Paulo Dybala scored from a near-impossible angle to give Juventus victory over Atletico Madrid on Tuesday and secure first place in UEFA Champions League Group D, according to Dailymail.co.uk reports. On the stroke of half-time, Dybala curled in a free-kick from near the by-line. The shot was so powerful that goalkeeper Jan Oblak didn’t have enough time to raise his arms before the ball travelled inside the far post. “It was a great goal, considering from where I took it,” Dybala said. “It seemed difficult.” Juventus, who had already qualified for the knockout stage, now have an insurmountable 13 points at the top of their group. Atletico, who would have qualified with a win, are next with seven points, just one point ahead of Bayer Leverkusen in third. They beat Lokomotiv Moscow 2-0 in the other group game on Tuesday night. Substitute Federico Bernardeschi nearly made it 2-0 for Juventus with a long, low shot that hit the post after the hour mark. In the final round of group matches Juventus visits Leverkusen and Atletico hosts Lokomotiv.

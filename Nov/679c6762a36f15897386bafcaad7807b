Ghana will revoke four petroleum exploration licences from companies that are not developing the assets, the country’s deputy minister for petroleum said on Wednesday. Mohammed Amin Adam told journalists in Cape Town that the country will take aggressive action to ensure that its petroleum assets are developed, according to Reuters. The licences were identified for termination after a review of 14 licence awards that were made in recent years. “Four of them are lined up for termination,” he said. The government has not yet notified the companies involved.

LAGOS – The Super Eagles of Nigeria have moved up four places in the most recent FIFA Ranking released by world football governing body. The Super Eagles, who were 35th in the last ranking, have moved up to 31st in the ranking released on Thursday, November 28 after the country gathered 1493 points this month. Despite the rise in the world ranking, Nigeria remain on the third position in the African ranking behind Senegal who are 20th in the world and Tunisia who occupy the 27th position. African champions Algeria (35) and Morocco (43) are also in the top five positions. Ghana (47), Egypt (51), Cameroon (53), Mali (56), Congo Democratic Republic (56) complete Africa’s top 10. It would be recalled that the Super Eagles in the last month got two wins out of two in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifiers, although the victories weren’t the only factors that contributed to the rise. The Super Eagles came from a goal down to defeat the Squirrels of Benin Republic 2-1 at the Godswill Akpabio International Stadium, Uyo on November 13 and four days later, November 17 bashed the Crocodiles of Lesotho 4-2, also from a goal down. Meanwhile, Belgium remains the best country in world football followed by world champions France, Brazil, England and Uruguay. Croatia, Portugal, Spain, Argentina and Colombia complete the top 10. The next FIFA rankings will be released on Thursday, December 19.

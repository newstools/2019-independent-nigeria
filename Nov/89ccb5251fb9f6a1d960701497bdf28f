European Council President Donald Tusk handed over the reins to his successor Charles Michel on Friday, as the European Union (EU) completes a change of leadership following EU-wide elections in May. “Europe is the best place on earth, at least as long as it remains a continent of freedom and rule of law … inhabited by a community aware of its history and culture,” Tusk said, before symbolically handing Michel the bell used at summits to call EU leaders to order, NAN reports via dpa. “I’m sure you, dear Charles, will use all your talents and virtues to maintain our unity,” he added. Michel, who recently stepped down as Belgian prime minister, said he would take a “common-sense approach to problem-solving with innovation and efficiency.”

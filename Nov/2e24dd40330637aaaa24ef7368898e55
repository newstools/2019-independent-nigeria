The team has been under the leadership of Evah Magala, President of the Uganda Ladies Golf Union (ULGU) and the newly elected All Africa Challenge Trophy (AACT) Trustee for East & Central Africa; incidentally, she was the overall winner in 2018. The Ugandans however, may not find the competition which teed off on Wednesday rosy this time around as other countries in the likes of Ghana, Zambia, and Zimbabwe among others are said to have presented very strong field as well for the 54 holes event. Host Nigeria who came second in the 2018 edition have some of their top players as Evelyn Oyome; Rachael Danjuma and Amina Wilfred in fiery form at the moment – it is expected that they will not only post strong opposition, they would want to impress as host nation by ending tops.

Liverpool defender, Virgil van Dijk has stayed very coy when asked if Chelsea can challenge for the EPL title this season by the Liverpool Echo. Chelsea are currently eight points behind Liverpool as things stand in the EPL table. Van Dijk and Liverpool established an eight point lead at the top of the EPL table after they beat Manchester City on Sunday. City are no longer Liverpool’s closest rivals in the current standings, with Chelsea and Leicester City both above Pep Guardiola’s men. And Van Dijk kept his cards close to his chest, when it was asked if Frank Lampard’s side could prove to be a threat. “Can Leicester and Chelsea challenge? I don’t know, that is something for you guys to put out in the media,” Van Dijk said.

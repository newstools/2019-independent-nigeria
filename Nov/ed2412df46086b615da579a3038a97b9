LAGOS – Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Lagos State governor, has commended the state’s public servants for their commitment to duty and efforts to improve service delivery despite tough times. Sanwo-Olu gave the commendation while speaking at the public presentation of “5 Decades of Excellent Public Service in Lagos: 1967-2017,” a compendium by the Association of Lagos State Retired Heads of Service and Permanent Secretaries (ALARHOSPS) at the Adeyemi Bero Auditorium, Alausa, Ikeja. The governor who was represented by Dr. Obafemi Hamzat, his Deputy, said that there was no gainsaying that the public service contributed immensely to the successes that had been achieved over the years, stressing that public service translates government policies, laws and social services into the daily work that keeps democracy going. He said, “Today the Lagos State Public Service has the reputation of being the most progressive Public Service in Nigeria. This could not have been made possible without the strong foundation which successive Heads of Service and Permanent Secretaries some of whom are seated here worked so hard to lay and build upon,” he said. Hakeem Muri-Okunola, Head of Service in the state while speaking said that the state has continued to be the foremost state in the Federation in terms of growth and development. “I can proudly say without fear of contradiction that one of our key strengths is this forum, which has enabled Lagos State to leverage on the wealth of experience of its past technocrats and further enhance consistency in the policy profile of the state.”

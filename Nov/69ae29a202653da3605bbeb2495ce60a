Practitioners of Advertising in Nigeria are gearing up to brainstorm for what promises to be the most eventful and momentous gathering of Advertising professionals in the history of the profession in Abuja, Joe-Eugene Onuorah, Deputy Director, Registration and Professional Development, APCON, has said He also stated that the Advertising professionals are converging in Abuja, to chart common grounds in confronting some of the challenges facing the profession as it continues to evolve from Monday, November 25, to Wednesday, November 27, 2019 for the National Advertising Conference holding at the Transcorp Hilton Hotel. According to Onuorah, the 2019 National Advertising Conference presents a good opportunity to discuss all of these issues and conflicts in an atmosphere that engenders honest appreciation of the viewpoints of all the stakeholders. The discussions will be guided by the theme, “Advertising in the post-digital age: the profession, the business and Nigeria’s socio-economic development”. The conference, he noted is the first of such event, bringing together professionals from the various specializations of the marketing communications practice and scholarship to share perspectives on the sustained development of the profession as well as chart common grounds in confronting some of the challenges facing the profession as it continues to evolve. “The conference is an initiative by APCON whose current management has successfully rallied leaders and members of the profession across sectoral affiliations and very significantly, advertising scholars in tertiary institutions, to join hands in organizing the conference. “Because of the level of consultations and organization preceding the conference and perhaps, because it is the first time the profession is hosting a national professional conference of a world-class standard, there has been an overwhelming expression and demonstration of passion, enthusiasm and excitement by Advertising practitioners as well as individuals and organisations who have been associated with advertising, to participate in the conference. “At the moment, the Conference Planning Committee and the Local Organising Committee are upbeat and making necessary contacts and arrangements to satisfy the huge expectations of the members of the profession and the larger public, whose marketing communications needs have been so creatively satiated by Advertising professionals, over the years. “Going by the wide range of consultations across the marketing communications industry preceding the conference and the painstaking planning of the conference, there is every reason to expect that the National Advertising Conference will be an event to remember for a long time after”, he said. It would be recalled that the 2019 edition of the Register of Advertising Practitioners lists over eight thousand practitioners in the various professional categories of Student, Associate, Full Membership and Fellows of the profession. The advertising profession is composed of practitioners in the different areas of socialisations.  These include: strategy and creative agencies/consultancies, media planning and buying agencies, platform owners and managers who provide and manage mass media outlets used to expose advertisements to desired audiences, activation and experiential agencies whose forte is creating and managing opportunities for brand direct/physical experience with prospects, among other specialisations.

At least eight US citizens with ties to Utah — including two mothers and five children — were reportedly shot dead by drug cartels in northern Mexico on Monday. The victims, who hold dual US-Mexico citizenship, were allegedly caught in the crossfire of two cartels in the Mexican border state of Sonora — near where they worship with Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network “It is with heavy hearts and unspeakable sadness we inform you that the 2 missing Mothers… along with many of their precious INNOCENT children have been slaughtered and gone to their Rest,” a relative, Lafe Langford Jr., wrote Monday on Facebook. The shooting victims included Maria Rhonita Miller, her four children, along with two other women and one of their daughters, the Tribune said. Family members said that 12 more people were missing. The remains of Miller and her children were found inside the family’s burned out, bullet-ridden Chevy Suburban. “We need this to be shared and the whole world to witness the atrocious inhumane and barbaric acts that were committed against us today,” Langford Jr. wrote along with a video of the vehicle.

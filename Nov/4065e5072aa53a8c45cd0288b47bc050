LAGOS – Coach Gernot Rohr has pegged January 1 as the day he would cease to be the coach of the Super Eagles if the Nigerian Football Federation (NFF) fails to open up a renewal talks with him regarding his contract with the former African champions. The coach said this much while discussing with the media recently, saying he has avalanche of federations jostling for his signature, even as he admitted that he had told all of them that he was waiting on the NFF to initiate a discussion. Although he would love to extend his contract, the former Bordeaux manager revealed he has been approached by other Federations and would start talking to them if NFF fail to offer him a new deal before January. “I’m ready to discuss as I have other federations who want me but I tell them that my priority is to discuss with the NFF. “But after January 1, I’ll be free to sign where I want. So I think the next step is to wait to see what NFF is doing.” Rohr was appointed as Super Eagles manager in 2016 and has overseen qualifications for two major events with a game to spare, while he also led the team to a third place finish at the 2019 Africa Cup Of Nations.

Hashtag #RIPPriyankaReddy is trending number 1 on Twitter as a 26-year-old doctor’s charred body was recovered in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad. The victim went missing while on her way to a clinic on Wednesday night and her body was recovered on Thursday. Since the doctor’s charred body was recovered, netizens have been demanding a speedy investigation to nab the killers and calling for the death penalty for them. The doctor (name withheld for legal reasons) went missing on Wednesday night, the 27th of November, and her family subsequently lodged a police complaint, Sputnik News reports. The next day, her charred body was found on the outskirts of Hyderabad near a toll plaza by villagers. The city police suspected she might have been raped and burnt to death, allegedly by a group of individuals. Angry netizens have been quick to swamp Twitter asking “how long these types of crimes will continue in the country” and also demanding “Quick convictions and capital punishment”. The victim’s sister, the complainant, told us that two people offered to help her sister but couldn’t as all the shops were shut at that hour. However, when the complainant tried calling her after an hour her phone was switched off following which she approached us”, said a senior police officer. Police officials also stated that they are checking the CCTV footage of the area to get clues about the accused. The National Commission for Women (NCW) has sent a member to Hyderabad to assist the family and take it up with the police. NCW’s Chairperson Rekha Sharma assured that they won’t leave any stone unturned until these perpetrators get the punishment they deserve. According to the latest National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report, a total of 32,559 rapes were reported in India in 2017.

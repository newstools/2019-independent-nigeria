Two persons including a woman, on Tuesday, appeared before an Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court for allegedly defrauding a man of N3,075,000 million on the false pretence of selling a plot of land for him. The defendants are; Olalekan Ojo, 52, estate agent at 6, Pasadena St., Alagbado and Olayinka Oyeleke, a woman trader at 20, Adurayemi Close, Alagbado, both in Lagos. They are being tried for conspiracy, stealing, obtaining money by false pretence and forgery. The prosecutor, Supol Raji Akeem, told the court that they committed the offences on Oct. 2 at Alagbado, Lagos. Akeem said that the defendants obtained three million and seventy-five thousand nairas from the complainant, Mr Olabode Ijalana on the false pretence of selling a plot of land at Alagbado, Lagos for him. “They forged the land documents and presented them to the complainant. “The complainant was on the land when the original owner of the land showed up and it was then he knew that he had been duped,” he said. The offences according to the prosecutor, contravened Sections 287, 314, 365 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The defendants, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. The Chief Magistrate, Mrs O. A Layinka, granted the defendants to bail of one million nairas each with two sureties in like sum. Layinka adjourned the case until Nov. 26 for mention.

ABUJA– Federal legislators in the House of Representatives have raised alarm on the poor condition of Ende Junction-Ore-Ilie-Ilosin/Ogbomoso road in Osun State, South West Nigeria. Consequently, the House has passed a resolution mandating the committees on Works and Federal Road Maintenance Agency (FERMA) to liaise with the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing, as well as FERMA with a view to carrying out the rehabilitation of the road. The resolution also called on the relevant agencies to expedite action on the construction of the abandoned bridge connecting Ilie to adjoining Communities all within Osun State. Hon. Afolabi Rasheed Olalekan (APC, Osun) moved the motion in the floor of the House calling attention to the deplorable state of Ikirun-Eko Ende Junction-Ore- Ilie-Iosin/Ogbomoso Road and the abandoned Ilie bridge connecting the town to Ikirun, Eko Ajala, Eko Ende, Ore, Olowosoke, Agbeye and Ilie to Ogbomoso in Oyo State. Explaining further, the lawmaker said: “Another contract for augmentation of the subsisting contract for additional work and review of the rates for construction of the bridge was awarded by the then Federal Ministry of Power, Works and Housing to Messrs MM & IF Integrated Nigeria Limited at the cost of N2, 546, 757, 559.10 in 2018 with an expected date of completion in December 2020, and yet the contractor has not mobilized to site”. He expressed concerns over the absence of a connecting bridge along the dilapidated road which was aggravating environmental degradation and erosion scourge in the vicinity because the accumulated rainwater is not channeled properly and therefore ends up flowing into people’s farmlands and homes. The representative noted that the continued abandonment of the aforementioned bridge has enormous adverse effects on the affected communities as it is vital in serving as a link between the adjoining communities, adding that its current state inhibits movement and transportation of agricultural produce from the predominantly farming communities to the urban centers. Barring further debate on the matter die to its infrastructural nature, the motion was referred to the relevant committees for urgent legislative actions.

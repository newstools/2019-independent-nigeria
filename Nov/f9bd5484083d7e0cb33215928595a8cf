ABUJA – Ex-militants in the Niger Delta region under the aegis of the National Coalition of Niger Delta Ex-Agitators (NCNDE-A) have warned the presidency and the Niger Delta Ministry to halt alleged plans to end the tenure of Professor Charles Dokubo, chairman, Presidential Amnesty Programme (PAP), saying that he has done far better than his predecessor. With controversies still surrounding the constitution of the Niger Delta Development  Corporation (NDDC) board, stakeholders principally affected by the amnesty programme fear that it might spread to the leadership of PAP. Explaining this worry, Israel Eshanekpe, aka Akpodoro, coordinator, NCNDE-A, said his group was aware of plans by some politicians to effect changes in the PAP administration, vowing that such would be resisted. He said: “Our group is solidly behind the Professor Dokubo owing to the fact that he has been able to keep the peace in the Niger Delta region since coming to office,” noting that his administration had never witnessed any crisis in the region. He maintained that the peace in the region was not by accident, but by the expertise displayed by the coordinator.

Pep Guardiola is happy in Manchester and under contract at Manchester City until 2021, his agent has reiterated. The former Barcelona and Bayern Munich coach faces an uphill battle to secure a third consecutive Premier League title this season with leaders Liverpool nine points ahead and unbeaten after their 3-1 victory over the Blues. A refusal to rule out coaching in Italy in future sparked more speculation about the manager’s future and reports that Bayern would be interested in a reunion were legitimised by new president Herbert Hainer, who mentioned his name when discussing long-term successors to the recently-sacked Niko Kovac. Guardiola has never spent more than four years at any of his clubs but his current contract at the Etihad would take him to five and a further renewal is not out of the question either. The City coach’s representative, Josep Maria Orobitg, said that nobody from any club had been in contact and while he did admit that anything can happen in football – something that Guardiola himself often brings up when asked about the future – a recent conversation has been enough to put aside any doubts. “I only spoke with Pep last Wednesday, and everything is the same: he feels good at Manchester City and also in the city of Manchester, and he has a contract until June 30, 2021,” he told Spox .

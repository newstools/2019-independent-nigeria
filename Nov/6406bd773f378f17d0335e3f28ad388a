Oil prices rose yesterday extending gains from the previous session, as an industry report indicated a fall in US crude stockpiles last week added to positive comments by the US Federal Reserve head on the US economy. The US West Texas Intermediate crude was up 20 cents, or 0.4 per cent, at $57.32 a barrel after rising 0.6 per cent on Wednesday, while the Brent futures were up 17 cents, or 0.3 per cent at $62.54 a barrel, having risen 0.5 per cent in the previous session. It would be recalled that the Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday the US economy would see a “sustained expansion” with the full impact of recent interest rate cuts still to be felt, boosting hopes for increased demand for crude. Powell’s “rosy view of the US economy reinforces the view that the Fed sees the economy is on a positive track,” said Stephen Innes, chief Asia market strategist at AxiTrader. US crude inventories fell by 541,000 barrels in the week to November 8 to 440 million, data from the American Petroleum Institute, API, an industry group, showed on Wednesday, compared with analysts’ expectations for an increase of 1.6 million barrels. Concerns have eased over a US recession, although an economic rebound is also not expected any time soon, according to a Reuters poll of economists released on Thursday. The poll also showed that economists believe the US-China trade war is unlikely to see a permanent truce over the coming year, which may further impact global growth and demand for oil, putting a cap on prices. Still, OPEC, Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo said global economic fundamentals remained strong and that he remained confident the United States and China would reach a trade deal.

ABUJA â€“ A group under the aegis of Accountable Leadership for Better Nigeria Initiative ( ALBNI ) has called on the Speaker of the Imo State House of Assembly, Chiji Collins to show proof of Doctorate Degree he claimed to have obtained from an Italian University. The group also urged the Speaker to explain the circumstances surrounding his exemption from participation in the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC). The group made the request in a press statement issued on Thursday in Abuja and signed by the Executive Director, Remi Adebayo. The group said Mr. Collins was not qualified to enjoy an exemption from participating in the compulsory national service scheme at age 24 because he obtained the certificate ahead of his thirtieth birthday as a ground for which suitable individual could be exempted according to the NYSC Decree. But when Daily Independent sought for the reaction of the Speaker on the allegations he denied discrepancy in his academic record, saying all documents regarding his studentship up to doctorate were intact and unblemished.

Wealth management technology provider Finantix has opened a new office in Australia to support its Asia-Pacific expansion. Located in Sydney, the office will be led by two local industry experts Martin McCabe and Todd Yarrow. Commenting on the expansion, Finantix APAC director Damien Piper said: “The country’s sophisticated financial services sector and ideal position as a key hub for the Asia-Pacific region makes Australia a very attractive market. “In addition, the wealth management sector has identified automation as an opportunity to do more with less as a response to rising expectations by Australian consumers. “This means that the potential for technology to assist with the remediation of the underlying pain points remains largely unrealized, representing an important growth opportunity for us.” McCabe, who has spent over two decades in financial technology sales, joins the company as the sales country manager for Australia. On the other hand, Yarrow will serve as the senior business development executive for Australia. Piper said: “We are very excited to welcome Martin and Todd to the Finantix family. They both bring a wealth of experience and knowledge that will be paramount in creating closer client relationships in Australia and more broadly in the Asia-Pacific region.”

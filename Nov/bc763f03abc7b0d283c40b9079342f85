ABUJA – The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has suspended the deadline placed on regularisation for shareholders that opened accounts for the purchase of shares with different names. This was part of the outcome of the third Capital Market Committee (CMC) meeting which held in Lagos over the weekend. Acting Director-General of SEC, Ms Mary Uduk said this will enable other shareholders that are having challenges with their details to come up and regularize their holdings, noting that, the commission has discovered that some shareholders are avoiding it due to the fear of prosecution. According to her, “The Multiple Subscription Committee presented the status of its ongoing engagement with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and Committee of Heads of Banking Operation to display multiple accounts regularization banners in the banking halls all over the country. “The Committee also reported that CMOs have commenced the filing of a report on regularized accounts with the Commission, quarterly. Given the relevance of this exercise and the need to create more awareness, the Committee requested for an extension of the deadline of multiple accounts regularization”.

Mfon Udoh, the prolific forward of Akwa United, will be making a return to Enyimba International of Aba as the Peoples Elephants play host to the Promise Keepers in one of the week three matches of the infant Nigeria Professional Football League. While Udoh can rightly be said to be one of the top performers in the domestic league, it is also right to argue that the former Calabar Rovers forward made his name while starring for the Peoples Elephants. For instance, while playing at Enyimba, he emerged the top scorer of the league in the 2013/2014 season; he won the monthly League Bloggers Award for 2013 and was honoured as the Nigerian Player of the Year in 2014. On the continent and while playing for Enyimba in the CAF Champions League in 2016, Udoh emerged the continent’s top scorer with nine goals. The feat was achieved even as Enyimba were eliminated at the semifinal by Al Ahly of Egypt. Meanwhile, the match between the two sides will always be titanic. The last time both sides met was last season’s Super 6 game at the Agege Stadium. Needing outright win to secure the league title among the six clubs that participated at the event, Enyimba rose to the occasion, trouncing Akwa United 3-0, with their former captain, Udoh, fully involved for Akwa United. He was just a week into his wedding then. However, speaking to SATURDAY INDEPENDENT, Udoh, who declined to say much on the encounter, said the match will be just like any other one, with no special preparation. “It is just like any other game; we are professional s and our job involves movement from one end to the other, so we hope to give Enyimba a big fight,” he said. Of the eight times both sides have met since 2015, Enyimba have won on three occasions, lost two times while the remaining fixtures ended in draws.

LAGOS – The Super Eagles of Nigeria came from a goal down to beat the Squirrels of Benin Republic 2-1 in their first Group qualifiers for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) played at the Godswill Akpabio Stadium, Uyo. The Squirrels gave the Super Eagles a scare in the early stages of the game as they went ahead in the fifth minute of play. A sloppy defending by the Super Eagles defenders allowed a free Stephane Sessegnon to slot the ball past a stranded Daniel Akpeyi in the box. It looks like the Kaizer Chiefs goalkeeper couldn’t do anything to stop Sessegnon from handing Benin the lead there. But after soaking up the pressure for the better part of the first half, the visitors made some defensive errors, including the penalty they conceded on the stroke of half-time when Ola Aina was upended in the box. Victor Osimhen made no mistake from the spot kick as he leveled scores for the Super Eagles to end the first half 1-1. On resumption of the second half, Nigeria struggle to break down the Benin defence but no goal to show for their efforts. The dominance is there but credit to Benin for holding on and defending in numbers. This is frustrating the Super Eagles. Samuel Kalu waltzed his way into the box taking apart three defenders and slotted from close range for the second goal for the Super Eagles. It was a complete turnaround with an individual effort. Meanwhile, the Super Eagles will on Saturday in Maseru take on the Likoena of Lesotho in their second qualifier in a match that promises to be thrilling and explosive after the Likoena did themselves a huge favour after a late equalizer against the Lone Stars of Sierra Leone in the group’s second match. The match ended 1-

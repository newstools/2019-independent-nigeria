A mother of four, Hassana Sale, has been discovered and rescued from a family-organised prison after having been locked in a dark room for two years in Kaduna by her siblings in order to separate her from her husband and children. Sale reportedly regained her freedom at Rigasa, Kaduna, Kaduna State in the northern part of Nigeria through the intervention of a Kaduna-based NGO called Arida Relief Foundation and the Kaduna State Police Command. Background information has revealed that the victim was deprived of her freedom by her elder brother; one Malam Lawal Sale over her intention to go back and join her husband and children in their matrimonial home. Founder of the NGO, Hajiya Rabi Salisu, explained that the woman became depressed when she was divorced by her husband.  However, due to her love for the children, she had made it a habit to visit the children daily; a habit which angered her brother who decided on the incarceration punishment. “She used to visit the children on a daily basis; so the elder brother and some of her relatives decided to lock her up in a dark room for two years. So that she will not go back to her ex-husband. We have taken her to the hospital and when she becomes stable; she would be handed over to the state Ministry of Human Service and Social Development to pursue the matter,” she said.

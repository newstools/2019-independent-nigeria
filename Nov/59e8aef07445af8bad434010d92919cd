Super Eagles technical adviser, Gernot Rohr is focused on delivering the six-points against the Squirrels of Benin Republic and the Crocodiles of Lesotho in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifying matches this week in Uyo and next week in Maseru. Nigeria will face Benin on Wednesday, November 14 at the Nest of Champions, Uyo before confronting Lesotho three days later in an attempt to kick start their campaign on a bright note. With some of the players already in camp, the German tactician said the players are in high spirits and prepared to make the country proud. “The game against Benin remains our topmost priority in kick starting our 2021 Africa Cup of Nations campaign.” “We are working towards ensuring that we pick the maximum point before thinking Lesotho a few days later. We are hoping the players will stay injury-free this weekend so that we can have a full house that will be ready to overcome Benin. “I have spoken with some of the invited players and they understand the importance of this very encounter to our qualification for 2021 AFCON.”

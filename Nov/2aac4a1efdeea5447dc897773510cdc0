LAGOS – As the country joins the world to mark the 30th anniversary of the Child Right Convention (CRC), Nigerian youths have decried lack of access to quality healthcare, education and other essential services required to achieve their full potentials. The youths said they had been worried over Nigeria’s preparedness in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 without the Federal Government creating the needed opportunities for young persons to develop in a safe environment. Speaking during a youth dialogue under the ‘Naija Youth Talk’ programme supported by United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) in Lagos State, weekend, some young persons demanded the government take action to see the country of their dreams. On health, Mmesoma Okonkwo, bemoaned difficulty in accessing healthcare in the rural areas where health seekers travel long distances to reach health centre as well as pay exorbitant amount for treatment. She urged the government to build health centres closer to the people, to make it easier  for people to receive quality healthcare services, even as she called on private sectors to use their platforms to educate young people as well as support good health provision which is also a part of SDGs.

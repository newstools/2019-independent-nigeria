LAGOS – The minister of Transportation, Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi, has  said that the Federal Government was on the move to build a new Sea Port in Pessu area of Warri, Delta state. According to Amaechi, the new port will cost about $800 million. Disclosing this at Uvwie during the empowerment for 1,700 women and youths with starter packs, micro-enterprise enhancement loan and resettlement packages, under the National Directorate of Employment empowerment programme, Amaechi, asked the youth of the community to ensure that the project was done smoothly. His words, “We are building a brand new Sea Port in Pessu, it will cost 800 million dollars. When you stop them from working you are losing such a huge investment where the entire community can be contractors, some can supply sand. “There is also the Bonny sea Port that is coming. The best thing to do is to allow the development. Imagine the companies that have left Warri, let the Sea Port project go on smoothly “, he appealed

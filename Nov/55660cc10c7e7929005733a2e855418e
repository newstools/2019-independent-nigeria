During his playing career Yaya Toure came up against some of the best players in the world. Three years at Barcelona and eight at Manchester City meant the 36-year-old competed against the best talents seen in the game but, while he has plenty to pick from when it comes to choosing his toughest opponent, it’s a surprise Manchester United man who tops his list. Asked by The Times who his most difficult opponent was he replied: “Nemanja Matic was complicated. He’s not quick but he’s so strong, clever. All the rest of the opponents, because I always looked at them carefully before games, I get their weakness.” Matic has fallen down the pecking order at Old Trafford this season and has lost his place in the starting XI to Scott McTominay. Consequently, the Serbia international is open to a move away from the club in January as Toure eyes a move back to the Premier League having left City last year. “I didn’t do enough. I missed winning the Champions League with City. There’s a lot of pressure. The Champions League is all the great teams, they are clever, they have this sharpness,” Toure said about his one regret at leaving City. “I saw the game against Atalanta, when City drew, and Kyle Walker was keeper. Unbelievable. He made a save. I don’t want to go in goal. Too difficult. “I just want people to give me a chance, and they’ll not be disappointed. I will carry on playing, maybe a few years. Premier League, Championship, depends, but being a manager is something I’m looking forward to a lot. I will start my badges. My big brother Leon is going to help me with that. I want to be close to my family.”

As every facet of the economy moves towards digital platforms, Tanzania is now looking to establish an Information Technology professionals board. The board will register all IT professionals in the country for the purpose of monitoring, controlling and securing the countryâ€™s cyber space while speeding up the uptake of technology. This is in keeping with the National ICT Policy 2016 developed to support the Tanzania Development Vision 2025, which recognises that ICT is central to a competitive economic transformation. An ICT Commission that was established in 2016 was given powers by the government to develop a pool of ICT professionals through targeted programmes. The Minister for Works, Transport Communications, Isack Kamwelwe, said recently that although the government is still in the process of formulating legislation to regulate the work of IT professionals, the objective of the ICT professionals board is to undertake matters such as registration, licensing and monitoring. Areas of focus Other areas of focus for the board include data access rights, privacy protection, computer fraud and crime, security and privacy of e-transactions, establishment of rules governing e-transactions, and delivery of e-opportunities to the wider population.

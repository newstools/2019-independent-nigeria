Abuja â€“ Justice Okon Abang of the Federal High Court, Abuja has granted bail to a British national, James Richard Nolan, to the tune of N500 million with a serving senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, who is not facing criminal charge in court, as surety in the like sum. Nolan, a signatory to Process and Industrial Development Limited (P&ID), is allegedly involved in the P&ID deal which made a British court enter a $9.6 billion judgment against Nigeria. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) had on October 21, arraigned Nolan and Adam Quinn (at large), both British nationals, over their alleged complicity in the $9.6 billion judgment against Nigeria. P&ID, an Irish engineering company, had secured the controversial judgment against Nigeria following the non-execution of a 20-year gas supply processing agreement the company had with the Federal Government. The defendants, both directors of Goidel Resources Limited, a designated non-financial institution, and ICIL Limited, were arraigned on a 16-count charge bordering on money laundering. Delivering ruling on the bail application of Nolan on Thursday, the court ordered the Nigeria Immigration Service to provide original passport and passport number of Nolan. The senator, according to the court, must own a developed landed property in Maitama with certificate of occupancy and relevant documents duly certified by the FCDA, and the chief registrar of the court must in writing ascertain the validity of the documents. Justice Abang directed that the surety must appear in court on all days of trial alongside the applicant, and must tender evidence of tax clearance for three years. The court held that where the surety failed to abide by the terms, the bail would be rescinded, adding that the applicant must submit his international passport to the registrar of the court.

LAGOS â€“ Reflecting on the comment by Adams Oshiomhole, national chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC) during its National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting, that all the 16 senators who dumped the party shortly before the 2019 general elections would not return to Senate, Ifagbemi Awamaridi, Lagos State gubernatorial candidate of Labour Party in the last general elections, said that the comment is weighty and a strong indication that the ruling party decides who wins election in the country. Ifagbemi, while speaking with Daily Independent on Tuesday, said wondered why the former governor of Edo State could say that those senators would not return because the electorate used their permanent voters cards (PVCs) to vote them out, knowing well that the elections were neither credible nor free and fair, especially in the last election in Kogi and Bayelsa states where Nigerians lost their lives because they wanted to chose their leaders. The Labour Party chieftain maintained that the ruling party, apart from manipulating elections, also manipulated the Judiciary, stressing that Oshiomhole had insisted that Dino Melaye would not return to the Senate for betraying his party at the 11th hour when he and others led by former Senate President, Bukola Saraki, dumped the APC.

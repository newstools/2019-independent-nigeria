Bauchi – The Bauchi State Government has sacked heads of administration of the twenty local government areas of the state even as it has banned the financing of funeral service introduced by the previous administration. This was part of the decisions made yesterday during the State Executive Council meeting presided by Governor Bala Mohammed held at the Government House, Bauchi. Addressing newsmen over the outcome of the meeting, the Commissioner of Information and Communication, Dr Ladan Salihu, explained that the decision to relieve the appointment of local government heads of administration was to allow the smooth conduct of workers BVN verification exercise in the respective local government. He said that the ongoing verification exercise was yielding positive results, as it would block all financial leakages, thereby boosting the revenue of the state. “The suspension of the funding of burial services by the state government is to stop the looting of public funds in the name of humanitarian services. Over N2 billion was claimed to have been spent on the funding of such services by the immediate past administration. “Instead of using public funds for such services, the state government has decided to sponsor the monthly provision of woods being used in graveyards across the state capital while members of the state cabinet will take charge of the provision of woods in their respective local government. “We will designate our little resources and channel them to critical areas of needs such as infrastructure, health, education and others” he said He said that during the meeting, the council deliberated on the proposed 2020 budget, which would be presented to the state House of Assembly next week.

Adekunle Akinlade, candidate of the Allied People’s Movement (APM) in the March 9, 2019 governorship election in Ogun State, has said he will challenge the verdict of the Court Appeal, which dismissed his petition against the election of Governor Dapo Abiodun of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Akinlade, who spoke on Saturday while addressing party supporters in Abeokuta, who thanked his supporters for their encouragement since the commencement of the pre-election process on October 2, 2018, said the move to challenge the judgment at at the Supreme Court became imperative to retrieve the mandate, which he believed was validly given to him by the people of Ogun State. “As you all know, we rightfully decided to challenge the governorship election results of March 9, 2019. Subsequently, the election petition tribunal and the Court of Appeal dismissed our petition on the grounds that the cornerstone of our case was a pre-election matter, thus, statute-barred. “Our conviction and believe in the legal system is unshaken despite the two previous judgments. Yesterday (Friday), November 15, 2019, elders and leaders across the state met and unanimously agreed that we must approach the Supreme Court to further test the strength of our case. “Our counsel have studied reasons alluded by the Court of Appeal for upholding the rulings of the lower court and advised us accordingly. I, therefore, state that we shall be approaching the Supreme Court for justice,” he said.

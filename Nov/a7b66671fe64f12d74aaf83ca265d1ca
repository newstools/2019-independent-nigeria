A group, Badagry Indigenes’ Professional (BIP), has called on Federal Government to institute an independent panel of inquiry into allegations of mismanagement at the Administrative Staff College of Nigeria (ASCON), Topo, Badagry, Lagos State. Addressing newsmen on Friday in Badagry, President of the group, Richard Fasinu, said that the panel should look into the prescribed retirement age of 60 years or 35 years of service and eight-year directorship tenure at the college. “They should also find out the logjam created by the 18 directors who are caught in the web of ratio 60 /35/ 8 which has technically stalled new employment and promotion of several eligible staff of the college. “This has also brought many of ASCON programmes to its knees,” he said. The group said that allegations of mismanagement at the college, which was published by a national daily, was yet to be investigated by the College Board Chairman, Mr Nduka Anyanwu. “This amounted to throwing away the bath water and the baby without calling for an emergency meeting of the board to look into those weighty allegations. “We all live in this town and we have people working in ASCON and everybody knows all is not well with the college,” the group said. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the briefing was attended by civil society groups, students, women groups, unionists and community leaders in Badagry.

UMUAHIA – As Abia State begins the second round of child immunisation against measles today, the state government on Wednesday said that its decision to start another round of the scheme is not only to forestall disability among infants in the state, but to save lives of children under the age of two. Fielding questions from DAILY INDEPENDENT in Umuahia on Wednesday, the Executive Secretary, Abia State Primary Healthcare Development Agency (ASPHDA), Dr. Chinagozi Adindu explained that the second phase of the immunisation would cover children from age group of zero to 23 months. According to him, the children to be involved are those not captured during the first phase of the exercise that started from zero-month to nine months. Initially, he remarked, the government had made the immunisation to cover children from zero to nine months, and that when the government found out through a research that some children immunized before they clocked nine could still be susceptible to measles, it then extended the coverage to 23 months. Describing measles as a deadly disease that kills thousands of children annually, Adindu said the state government has taken delivery of vaccines for the second phase pointing out that the vaccines would be available in the 914 primary healthcare centres across Abia State. He therefore charged parents particularly mothers to avail their children below the age of 23 months the opportunity of receiving the vaccines since it is free of charge and that the government may even use force to compel parents to access the vaccines. His word, “the state government may use force because some parents, out of religious or cultural reasons, may decide to deny their children below that age the opportunity of being vaccinated: which means that their ignorance today may result to many disabilities tomorrow”. On how a mother could dictate whether her child is suffering from sickness, Adindu explained that when a child shows signs such as high fever, redness of eyes, running nose and rash, such a child should immediately be taken to the nearest health facility for treatment.

ABUJA – The federal government has challenged commissioners for Budget and Economic Planning to devise alternative ways of revenue generation for sustainable development of the nation’s economy. Prince Clem Agba, Minister of State Budget and National Planning, gave this charge on the occasion of the forum of commissioners of Budget and Economic Planning, Community of Practice COP which held recently in Abuja. He urged the economic planners to re- prioritise states’ needs and address the core areas to ensure effective and efficient usage of the revenue, maintaining that “we are not putting sufficient money in the right sectors of our economy” He also decried the nation’s continuous dependence on oil, as Nigeria’s major source of revenue, saying that “due to current environmental global uncertainties and volatility, it has become imperative that we do not continue to hold onto the erroneous belief that oil will continue to provide an endless source of revenue for the nation”

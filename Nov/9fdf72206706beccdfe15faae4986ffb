Lagos – Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State has expressed concerns over the increased number of road crashes on roads linking the state, stating that his administration was set to review the implementation of road insurance scheme so as to provide succour to accident victims. He stated this at the 2019 Ember Month Mega Rally tagged; ‘Road Safety is a State of Mind, Road Traffic Crash is Absence of Mind’, organised by Ogun State Sector Command of the Federal Road Safety Corps  (FRSC), in conjunction with Shell Nigeria Gas Limited. The governor, speaking through Noimot Salako-Oyedele, his deputy, said the ember months have become very notorious in the country, as this year’s statistic was worrisome. He applauded the initiative of FRSC to combat the trend, which he said was timely. While commending the corps for the enforcement of traffic laws and implored drivers to see the agency as partner in progress by obeying traffic rules and regulations, he assured that his government would ensure that roads across the State were in good conditions. Clement Oladele, the sector commander, FRSC, Ogun State Command, earlier in his remarks said the command had recorded a total of 617 road crashes in the state as at November 10, 2019, with 301 deaths, noting that this propelled the sector to double her operations to stem the trend. He stated that the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing has agreed to remove all traffic diversions along the Lagos- Ibadan Expressway by December 15, as well as carry out 24 hours surveillance on the roads and major highways in the State, as part of measures to prevent end of the year crashes. According to him, arrangements have been concluded to deploy 1700 regular and special marshals, 35 patrol vehicles, four life support ambulances, five patrol bikes and a heavy duty tow truck, to support a robust ember months special patrol operations. He expressed confidence that, with these measures, end of the year road crashes would be minimal this year.

The world’s biggest catering firm, which provides meals for office workers, armed forces and school children in 45 countries, said it expects 2020 organic revenue growth around the mid-point of its 4-6% guidance range. The lackluster outlook took the shine off a 4.7% rise in underlying operating profit to 1.88 billion pounds for the year ended Sept. 30, helped by growth in North America and the UK defense and sports and leisure businesses. “Consumer confidence (in Europe) continues to decline and a number of key clients, notably in manufacturing, automotive and financial services, have reduced their headcount in recent months,” the company said in a statement. Catering for business and industry brings in 39% of revenue with Compass counting Alphabet Inc’s Google (GOOGL.O), Boeing Co (BA.N), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Chevron Corp (CVX.N) among its clients. Chief Executive Officer Dominic Blakemore said Compass’ overall expectations for 2020 were positive but it remained cautious about economic conditions in Europe.

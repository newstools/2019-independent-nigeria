LAGOS – As the Ogun State Command of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) commends its ember-month road safety campaign, it has appealed to the motorists to bear with the Federal Government over the current situation of roads across the country. Speaking at the commencement of the campaign organised by the Ifo Command on Monday, Clement Oladele, Ogun Sector Commander of FRSC, said that the Federal Government was working tirelessly to ensure that bad roads received quality attention across the country. Represented by Bridget Asekhauno, Ogun FRSC Head of Administration and Human Resource at the campaign tagged: “Road Safety is a State of Mind; Road Crashes is an Absence of Mind. Stay Alert, Stay Alive,” Oladele said, “The FRSC has received assurances from the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing that the contractors would soon return to site”. He implored motorists to adhere strictly to the stipulated speed limit at construction zones and exercise patience at the bad portions of the roads to avoid unnecessary crashes.

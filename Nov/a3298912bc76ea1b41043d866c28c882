ABEOKUTA – Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State, on Thursday, fired a note of warning to university teachers that his administration would bring down the full weight of the law on lecturers who take advantage of their students or sexually harassed them. His administration, he said, would not condone any form of sexual immorality or other vices in any of Ogun State-owned institutions of higher learning. The governor made this known at the 11th convocation ceremony of Tai Solarin University of Education (TASUED), Ijagun, Ijebu-Ode, saying the much talked about whistle blower going around the higher institution on sexual harassment is a thing of shame that shouldn’t happen in any tertiary institution where discipline is taken seriously. Abiodun commended the vice chancellor of the institution, Professor Abayomi Arigbabu, for the sensitisation and warnings embarked upon on the pages of national dallies, saying the zero tolerance of the institution is a pointer that indiscipline from any staff will not be condoned. “Government notes with pride the sensitisation and warning publication by the vice chancellor of this great institution, this government will not close its eyes to indiscipline and unwholesome attitude on the part of any staff.” Abiodun also commended TASUED for maintaining uninterrupted academic calendar and for being the most peaceful tertiary institution in the country. He added that in order for school curriculum to be relevant to the dynamics of the 21st century, the state government had begun to match “the gown with the town” to make both mutually beneficial.” This marriage between town and gown is being operationalised, according to Abiodun, to provide a platform that creates and strengthens regular interface between the industry and the academia so as to ensure that the curricular equips the products of tertiary institutions in the state with the required competencies. He noted that institutions of higher learning should continually incorporate in their various school curriculums the needs of the people which he said will eventually power the development of the individual and the society.

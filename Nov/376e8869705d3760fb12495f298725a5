Barcelona players – past and present – who have won European titles will be paid lifetime salaries by the club thanks to Lionel Messi. It was the Argentine’s goal in 2009’s UEFA Champions League (UCL) final against Manchester United that convinced then-president Joan Laporta to set up the scheme. More than 290 players are set to be given the salary, benefitting from Laporta’s promise. One of those is Juan Carlos Heredia, who won the Cup Winners’ Cup in 1979. He’s now opened up about the reward and explained how Messi made it possible. “When Barcelona won the UCL final in Rome against Manchester United with a goal from Messi, the club president declared that all those who were European champions with Barcelona were going to receive a salary for life. And he fulfilled it,” Heredia told The Tactical Room. As well as winning the European Cup a decade ago, Barca have secured four more UCL titles, four Cup Winners’ Cups and three Fairs Cups throughout their history. Their latest triumph came in 2015 but since then, the continent’s biggest prize has not returned to Camp Nou. But Messi, the man who secured his fellow club legends a lifetime salary, has also made it clear he intends to lift the UCL again. Messi has promised to win the UCL again. After taking the captain’s armband from Andres Iniesta in 2018, the Argentine made a speech to supporters promising to do everything to win the trophy. “Although last year we won La Liga and the Copa del Rey, we all got stung in the UCL,” Messi said in August 2018. “We promise that we will do everything possible so that this beautiful cup returns to the Camp Nou again.”

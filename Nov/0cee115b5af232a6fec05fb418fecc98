Ughelli – The Executive Chairman of Egbema and Gbaramatu Communities Development Foundation (EGCDF), Jude Ebitimi Ukori, has revealed that the Global Memorandum of Understanding (GMoU) sponsored by Chevron Nigeria Limited has been reviewed upward by 18 percent to accommodate more developmental projects in the area. Speaking during a town hall meeting to boost and strengthen EGCDF’s cordial relationship with the communities, Ukori said the upward review was part of issues reviewed during the renegotiation of the GMoU document that governs their relationship with Chevron Nigeria Limited and the Delta State Government. He said the meeting was in line with the EGCDF core values of transparency and accountability as they believe in the efficiency of two-way communication as it provides understanding and promotes peace and unity amongst stakeholders of the communities. Ukori noted that CNL has approved the building of a block of hostel for Maritime University, Okerenkoko, and increase in the amount payable to secondary school scholarship beneficiaries from N20,000 to N30,000 starting from 2019/2020 academic sessions.

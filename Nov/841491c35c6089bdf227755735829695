Unai Emery’s position is under scrutiny after a run of just two wins from their last 10 Premier League games, according to Bbc.com reports. However, Arsenal head of football Raul Sanllehi and managing director Vinai Venkatesham say they have no immediate plans to make a change of manager. “We firmly believe Unai is the right man for the job,” they told Arsenal staff at a meeting. “We are as disappointed as everyone else with both our results and performances at this stage of the season. “We share the frustration with our fans, Unai, players and all our staff as they are not at the level we want or expect. Things need to improve to meet our objectives for the season. “We are all working intensively behind the scenes to turn things around and are confident we will. “We never take our fantastic support for granted. We hope we can all stick together and get behind the team in this challenging period, as together we are stronger.”

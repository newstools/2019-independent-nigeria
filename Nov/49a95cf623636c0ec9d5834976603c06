LAGOS – Engr. Musa Kida, President of the Nigeria Basketball Federation (NBBF) has expressed optimism of D’Tigress qualifying for the 2020 Olympic Games billed for Tokyo despite the team grouped alongside world number one, United States of America (USA). In a brief ceremony held in Switzerland on Wednesday, the reigning African Champions, Nigeria will face USA, Serbia and Mozambique in the battle for a spot at the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo. D’Tigress will play in Belgrade after being drawn in Group A. Reacting to the draw, Kida said qualification for the 2020 Olympics is possible despite admitting that it was a difficult draw. “Being drawn against world number one (USA) and seven (Serbia) surely will not make the job easy but I am optimistic that qualification for the Olympics is possible. “The men have already qualified and all eyes are on our women to also join their counterparts in Tokyo. D’Tigress are the reigning African Champions and we hope this will count for something when they start the qualifiers,” he said. He however hammered on the need for early preparation for the team if they are to stand a chance in the group. “We know that tournament of this magnitude costs money, time and proper planning. We are going to be working with the Ministry of Sports and the Honorable Minister, Hon Sunday Dare to ensure that we return to the Olympic Games,” Kida said. DAILY INDEPENDENT gathered that the last time Nigeria met USA was at the quarterfinals of the FIBA Women’s World Cup in Spain where the D’Tigress lost 41-70 points against the team that later went on to win the trophy.

A total of 10 teams will join USA (World Champions) and host- Japan from the OQT to be played from February 6 to 9, 2020 across four countries- China, Serbia, France and Belgium.

UMUAHIA – Ahead of National Sports Festival (NSF) in Benin, Edo State next year, physically challenged athletes under Abia State Sports Council (ASSC) have cried out to the state government over challenges facing the State Team to the annual sporting event. The Edo 2020 is scheduled to hold from March 20 to April 1, while the state will feature in 26 events of the 33 listed for the festival. Speaking on condition of anonymity to DAILY INDEPENDENT in Umuahia, Tuesday, some of the athletes highlighted their challenges to include mobility, training equipment and other logistics, including motivation. According to one of them who pointed out that the coaster bus they have was donated to the ASSC by the then governor of the state, now senator representing Abia North, Orji Uzor Kalu in 2000 and queried, “How can we do sports without a vehicle?” The athletes who have commenced training in earnest lamented that in most cases, the physically challenged among them were carried to the venue of the competition on the back of their fellow athletes, thereby exposing them to contempt and ridicule by athletes from other states. They also groused over absence of facilities and equipment for training, adding that this also constitutes a major draw back for them. According to a disabled athlete who is also a gold medalist in an international event, lack of award and appreciation by the state government has demoralized winner-athletes, pointing out that after Abuja 2018, other states rewarded their athletes, “and up till now, Abia State Government has not deemed it fit to appreciate and reward Abia contingent. We are no longer motivated to win laurels”.

LAGOS – MTN Group has expressed optimism for the future of financial transactions via mobile services. The telecoms giant’s CEO and president, Rob Shuter, in his keynote discussion around digital inclusivity at the AfricaCom 2019 conference in Cape Town, South Africa on Wednesday, said MTN doesn’t think of itself as a telco anymore. He elaborated, stating that the reason for the potential shift is because the company has a strategy to push out its business across three fronts that are telco-specific and fintech. MTN Group as around 32 million 30- day active Mobile Money customers. According to him, “I think we’re a scale player in fintech already. The third aspect of the strategy is to be a scale player in some narrowly defined digital services, particularly media, messaging and mobile advertising.” Looking at the intersection of these three things, we say that it’s basically our strategy to be a digital operator, said Shuter. In July, the JSE-listed group named Yolanda Cuba as group chief digital and fintech officer. In this role, she will lead the group’s strategic expansion of its financial services and digital solutions efforts and transformation into a digital operator, said the company. According to Shuter, MTN has a shared belief that everybody deserves the benefits of a modern connected life. “Looking across our markets, of our 244 million customers, only around 87 million are using their mobile device for Internet services. This means about two-thirds are living in a 2G voice and SMS world.

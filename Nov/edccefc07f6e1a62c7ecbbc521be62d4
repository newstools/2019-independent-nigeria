There are indications that workers at the Federal level and Lagos State will begin to benefit from the recently signed N30,000 Minimum Wage by President Muhammadu Buhari by December this year. The Association of the Senior Civil Servants of Nigeria (ASCSN) made the disclosure yesterday at its National Executive Council (NEC) meeting in Abeokuta. Recall that the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and the Trade Union Congress (TUC) last month after the completion of the consequential adjustment at the federal level charged the states to commence their negotiations and ensure that they wrapped it up by December. Bobboi Bala Kaigama, ASCSN’s President at the NEC meeting, said the states that are yet to commence negotiations should take a clue from Kaduna state that has commenced payment even before the consequential adjustment was concluded at the federal level. He, however, warned that it would move to states in January to shut down the erring ones who fail to conclude the consequential negotiation by the December deadline issued by the two labour centres. “At the states level, we know the game they want to play and we are ready for them. Labour will take joint action against those states. The law of Minimum Wage is explicit, unlike before, now defaulting states can be prosecuted. This time around they have no escape route”, he said. The ASCSN President noted that Kaduna state government has played safe because its paying more than what was negotiated at the federal inspite that it commenced payment early. He, however, warned that by January, the union will start taking stock to get the defaulting states and take appropriate action against them. On the payment of the consequential adjustment at the federal and Lagos State, the Secretary General of the Association, Bashir Alade Lawal said the union has it on good authority that workers would be paid in December.

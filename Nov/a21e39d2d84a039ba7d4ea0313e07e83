This season has provided a lot of positive talking points and one of them is the hitherto unheard away wins, particularly in the start of hostilities, happening even before the match-day three crackers get underway this weekend. On the strength of away wins, two clubs, Plateau United and Wikki Tourists, have set themselves apart from the rest. Both sides have won two games each in as many matches and they sit pretty at the top of the log. Plateau United started the season with a home game against former champions, Lobi Stars. The Peace Boys defeated Lobi Stars 3-1 with Silas Nenrot, Solomon Kwambe and Amos Gyang grabbing the goals for them, while Sikiru Alimi got the solitary and consolatory strike for the visitors. In their second game of the season, Plateau United travelled to face Jigawa Golden Stars and at the end of the hostilities, it was the visitors that had the last laugh as they pegged their hosts with a 34th minute goal scored by Nenrot Silas. On their own, Wikki Tourists defeated Jigawa Golden Stars in the match-day one of the season, piping them 2-1, as Saidu Abdullahi and Mohammed Guda were on the score sheet, even as Lala Abdullahi got the first goal of the game for the visitors in the 15th minute. In their second game last Sunday, they travelled to Lafia where they engaged Nasarawa United. At the end of the game, it was Wikki that went home with the three points through Sixtus Forsahâ€™s 80th minute goals. Meanwhile, come this weekend, the tide will certainly change at the top of the log as the two sides go head to head and the match will be taking place at the refurbished Jos Township Stadium. From their head-to-head, both sides are equal on winnings from 2016. With five meetings between them, there have been two wins apiece with one draw separating them.

OSOGBO â€“ Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, has promised to deploy all apparatus of government in the state to eliminate open defecation. Speaking at a campaign against open defecation in Osogbo, Osun State, Governor Oyetola called on the residents of the state to refrain from the practice of open defecation. This is coming even as Kafayat Oyetola, wife of the governor, hinted that she would lead the campaign across the nooks and crannies for proper monitoring and effectiveness. Governor Oyetola said that open defecation and other unhygienic practices are of serious concern to his administration and, Ileri Oluwa Development Initiative, the pet project of his wife. He admonished residents of the state to join hands with the government and organisation to eliminate open defecation in all the nooks and cranny of the state. While describing the act as uncivilised and inimical to good health, Oyetola noted that the practice also pollutes the environment and exposes people to diseases and ill health, which can result to death if not promptly and properly managed.

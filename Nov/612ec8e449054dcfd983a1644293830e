Ibadan – Oyo State Governor, Engineer Seyi Makinde, has pledged to rehabilitate the Awotan Dumpsite off Apete/Akufo Road to prevent environmental hazard in the area. The Governor made the pledge while speaking during a visit for an on-the-spot assessment of the site in Awotan, Apete, Ibadan, assuring the residents of the area and contractors at the dumpsite that all the identified challenges at the site will be addressed by the Government. A statement signed by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Mr. Taiwo Adisa, quoted the Governor as saying that the Apete/Awotan axis would witness huge government presence in 2020 fiscal year. According to the Governor, the Apete/Akufo road will be fixed in 2020, as it has been captured in the 2020 Budget. He also said that the road would benefit from the planned uplift of the Akufo Farm Settlement, which government is about to transform to Farm Estate. According to him, the project would begin in the New Year. The Governor said: “I assure the people and the contractor at this dumpsite that all the challenges outlined to us will be addressed as soon as possible. We recognise the environmental impact on our people, especially with the potable water facilities within about two kilometres radius of the dumpsite. “The Chairman of the Oyo State Road Maintenance Agency (OYSTROMA) is here. We will make sure the road is fixed soon because it leads to Akufo Farm Settlement. And you know we have said that the money we will spend on the rehabilitation of the road has been captured in the 2020 budget. “Also, we are upgrading the farm settlement to Farm Estate and I can assure you that the work will commence in January. But we can only achieve all of these with your support and cooperation. We want you to organize yourselves because jobs will begin to come close to you in this area. Organize yourselves and your children for the job opportunities on the way.”

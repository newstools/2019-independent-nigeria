LAGOS – The Nasarawa State Government has promised to come to the aid of Nasarawa United for them to pay the N4.3 million fine clamped on the club by the Nigerian Professional Football League (NPFL). Recall that the Solid Miners claimed that they deserved a penalty in their week 3 match against Plateau United which ended 1-1. Consequently, some of the officials were molested while the club’s media officer, Eche Amos, went on a press release, castigating the handling of the match. The League Management Company (LMC), organisers of the league, came down hard on the club, fining them a whopping N4, 250,000 (US$11,700) for breaches of league rules. The fine includes 1,250,000 naira ($3,500) compensation for the match officials. Club spokesman Eche was also fined $300 and cautioned for ‘releasing or causing to be released, a written press statement unfairly criticising match officials, a conduct deemed capable of bringing the League to disrepute’. However, speaking to DAILY INDEPENDENT, a club official, who is also an official of the state government, who preferred anonymity, said that the state government has promised to offset the fine and promised to make sure the club stays out of any form of trouble. “We are unduly treated because the way and manner the match was handled left much to be desired.

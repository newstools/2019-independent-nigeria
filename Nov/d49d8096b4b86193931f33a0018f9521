Global payments giant, Visa, is paying $200 million for 20% stake in Interswitch, Nigeria’s largest electronic payments company, according to reports. The investment places a billion-dollar valuation on 17-year old Interswitch and is a major boon ahead of a proposed initial public offering slated for the London Stock Exchange next year. While Visa’s stake purchase would confirm Interswitch’s unicorn status, the company was reportedly set to be valued at as much as $1.5 billion ahead of a planned IPO next year. The company’s previous plans for a 2016 IPO were scrapped amid a recession in Nigeria. Interswitch would not be the first Africa-focused tech company to achieve the billion-dollar so-called unicorn status. Jumia, the e-commerce company, led by a mix of international executives and investors listed for over $1.4 billion in April. The backing from Visa is the latest in a string of moves by global payments companies backing African fintech companies and seeking high-growth bets in emerging markets. The fundamental importance of the services that fintech companies provide—from powering payments, facilitating savings and ensuring financial inclusion for the unbanked to tackling access to credit for small businesses and individuals—underlines why the sector holds longterm appeal for investors. And, by most metrics, Interswitch represents significant value proposition given its established strength as an early-day and major player in financial technology with operations in over 20 African countries.

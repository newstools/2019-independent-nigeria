AWKA – The police in Awka has recovered the decomposed body of a 65-year-old medical doctor believed to have died in his sleep three months before his death was noticed. The body of the medical doctor, Dr. Gilbert Afam Gini, was discovered by the property manager of an apartment he rented at No. 26 Igweze Street in the Kwata area of the state capital. The State Police Public Relations officer, Mohammed Haruna, who confirmed the story said that on Wednesday, November 26, at about 1:20 p.m. the manager of the property, Duke Onyebuchi Ezeonwuka, a lawyer, and manager of ‘God’s Own Plaza’ at No. 26 Igweze Street, Kwata junction, Awka, reported to the police at ‘B’ Division after he visited the plaza located at No. 9 Eze Crescent Ezinifite, Okpuno. The property, the police said belonged to one Ugochukwu Okafor, a native of Okeani Village, Oko, in Orumba North local council area. Dr. Gini, a native of Abacha in Idemili North local council had rented two of the 4-flat one storey building for both clinic and residential purposes. When the property manager arrived, however, there was no sign of life in both the clinic and the living apartment and all the doors were locked from within. When he called the phone number, it was switched off. Initially, according to Mohammed, the manager thought the doctor had traveled only to perceive a foul odour from one of the rooms. This prompted him to invite neighbours who assisted him to open the window through which they saw the decomposed body in the room.

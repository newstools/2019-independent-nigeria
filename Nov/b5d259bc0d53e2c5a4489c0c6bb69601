Babcock University has recorded another landmark as the institution produced the best graduating student in the 2019 final examination of the Nigerian Law School. A press release by the university’s Director of Communication and Marketing, Joshua Suleiman, gave the name of the student as Mayowa Mubashir Abiru. His performances in the various subjects were declared outstanding. By the achievement, Abiru automatically qualifies as the law school star prize winner for the Overall-Best Graduating Student for the Year 2019. Mayowa graduated from Babcock University in the 2018 academic session with second class upper. Meanwhile, Babcock University produced 10 students with First Class in the same Bar Examination this year. Professor Ademola Tayo, the President Vice Chancellor of the university, has congratulated the students and their faculty for the feat, noting that Babcock University would continue to strive for excellence in every aspect of her programmes. “It is for this reason that the university was founded to be an academic entity of excellence, offering value in cutting-edge and functional education to her students.” Babcock University has consistently produced award winners at the Nigerian Law School since 2012 when Alao Adeleke, a law graduate of the University, made First Class at the Law School. In 2015 and 2016, Babcock University came first at the Law School. Ali Bologi, one of Babcock University students that made First Class, emerged third overall best student in Professional Ethics in 2015. In the same year 2015, Bukoye Temitayo made First Class and was third overall best nationwide. Babcock University was second best in 2017 at the Nigerian Law School.

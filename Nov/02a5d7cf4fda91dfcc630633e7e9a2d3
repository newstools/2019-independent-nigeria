UMUAHIA – Miss Oluchi Okala, the young lady from Ohafia LGA of Abia State who made a first class in both at the Abia State University (ABSU), Uturu and the Nigerian Law School, Abuja has bagged a scholarship from the state government to PhD level. Miss Okala will also be employed by the university as a graduate assistant in its Faculty of Law. Governor Okezie Ikpeazu, who gave the directive in Umuahia after the young lawyer was called to the bar, last week, directed the Vice Chancellor of the University to immediately offer Okala Oluchi, the post of graduate assistant in the Faculty of Law of the Abia State University, Uturu. In addition, the Abia governor announced a cash reward of N1million to her. According to a statement from the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Mr Onyebuchi Omemanka, Ikpeazu, as a strong believer that “any Abian who excels and brings honour to the state in any given endeavour deserves the collective accolades of the government and people of the state” has decided to encourage her to earn more laurels. “In this case of Oluchi Okala”, the governor added, “her academic feats have put not only our state university but indeed, our state in positive light. She is the reason why our state university’s name appears on the list of universities that produced first class graduates of the Nigerian Law School this session. “That she sustained her first class performance at the university and the law school, speaks to the quality of teaching at the Abia State University and the State in general”, he observed.

The PPRO said, “There is nothing like that in the community. Actually, we received reports from the community of disappearance of organs last Saturday. “Immediately, the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) in Guma LGA visited the affected community, with the aim of taking the victims for medical examination, no one came out. “So, there is nothing like organ disappearance in the community.” she insisted.

At least three people were killed in renewed anti-government protests in Guinea, an opposition party said on Friday. The deaths occurred as opposition supporters marched on Thursday against President Alpha Condeâ€™s plans to amend the constitution to run for a third term, the National Front for the Defence of the Constitution (FNDC) said in a statement, NAN reports via dpa. Opposition leaders say security forces have killed at least 17 people since mid-October.
Human rights group Amnesty International places the death toll of those killed in various anti-government protests since 2015 at about 70. Moreover, hundreds of people, including small children, have been injured by members of the security forces using live ammunition, batons and tear gas canisters, according to Amnesty. Conde is due to step down in 2020, at the end of his second five-year presidential term, but has indicated plans to amend the constitution to allow him to run for re-election. The 81-year-old came to power in 2010, and was re-elected in 2015, promising to strengthen democracy and fight corruption in the country of roughly 13 million people.
But he and his son have since then been implicated in numerous corruption scandals, largely linked to the mining industry, and has been suspected of election rigging. Guinea is rich in bauxite, iron ore and diamonds but also mines gold, nickel and uranium.

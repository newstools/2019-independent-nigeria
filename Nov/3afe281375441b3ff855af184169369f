At least eight Iraqi anti-government protesters were killed early on Thursday as security forces opened fire to disperse a demonstration in the southern city of Nassiriya, medical sources said. Another 22 people were wounded, the sources said. They said the incident took place before dawn on Thursday. Meanwhile, Iran has condemned the burning of its consulate in southern Iraq by anti-government protesters hours earlier. Iran’s official IRNA news agency said Thursday that Abbas Mousavi, a foreign ministry spokesman, called for a “responsible, strong and effective” response from Iraq’s government.

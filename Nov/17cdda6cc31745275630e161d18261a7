LAGOS – Ikeja Viva L’Amour Lions Club has been applauded for the free diabetes screening for the pupils of Covent Primary School, Maryland, as well as some adults within the environs. Margaret Prebei, a parent and class six teacher in the school, expressed appreciation on behalf of the children and other beneficiaries after the free exercise. Speaking with Daily Independent, she said that the club had done a great service to humanity, especially the kids who eat anything, anyhow, without considering the side effect or health implications of what they consume. “I would like to say a big thank to the club. This is a good gesture and a noble service to our children. Most parents never thought of making their children available for this type of test but with what they have done today, it would afford parents to know the status of the children. “Every child who was screened today would go back to his or her parents with the outcome of the test. If there is any issue or anything to be corrected, today’s screening would provide ample opportunity for quick action. “Targeting the children is a good action in the right direction. The issue of diabetes is a matter that needs to be nipped at the bud. They have done well. May the Lord continue to bless them,” she prayed. The club’s President, Lion Folashade Ashafa, said that children would take the greater share of the club’s projects in this lion year. “Just as we did last month on free eyes test, donations of eye glasses and drugs, today, we have screened over 120 pupils and 30 adults. This is our calling and we shall continue in every area we can to make life better for our society,” the president assured.

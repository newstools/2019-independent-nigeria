The present poor performance of Rangers International of Enugu in the Nigerian top flight is still eliciting reactions from different quarters on the need to move the team forward. Christian Chukwu, former coach and captain of the club in this regard, has challenged the Enugu State Government to stand firm in support of the club. He added that the interim coach, Sylvanus Okpala, should also be supported to succeed while his service lasts in the prosecution of the on-going Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) which is still very fresh. According to Chukwu who has been in and out of Rangers management in recent times, “Rangers are in a dire situation at the moment; to lose three matches at a go is really not a charring news; but whatever the case maybe, I can only sincerely plead with the state government not to relent in supporting the team like it has been doing.” “Also I would want the entire team to work harmoniously to ensure Okpala succeeds; it is not going to be easy, but all hands must be on deck; the players must be committed too; all stakeholders must support the team to succeed – Rangers means so much to us,” Chukwu said. It would be recalled that the club Management on Sunday sacked coach Benedict Ugwu and the entire technical crew. The Enugu State Commissioner for Youths and Sports, Vitus Okechi, made the announcement after Rangers lost 2-0 to minnows Akwa Starlets (Dakkada) FC of Akwa Ibom at home. Ugwu was appointed in July as caretaker coach after the expiration of the contract of Gbenga Ogunbote. The latter served the club from 2017 to July 2019.

Steven Gerrard insists he’s not expecting many new signings at Rangers in January. The Ibrox manager spoke to the media this morning following his side’s 2-2 draw with Feyenoord last night. That draw puts them on the verge of qualification to the last 32 of the Europa League, with Rangers needing at least a point from their final game against Young Boys to go through. And ahead of his side’s clash with Hearts at Ibrox on Sunday, Gerrard has spoken about what January could have in store for his team. According to the former Liverpool midfielder, he’s not expecting much change in his squad: Rangers Football Club

@RangersFC
 SG: We are on the same page with the Chairman and the board with where the squad is at. I don’t think there will be much change in terms of incomings in January. Of course, if the right player becomes available we would be interested. 124

Gerrard’s team are in the Betfred Cup final against Celtic at the start of the league, joint on points with Celtic at the top of the Premiership table and on the verge of the Europa League last 32 – so it can’t get much better at the moment.

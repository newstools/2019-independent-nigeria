LAGOS – Oliver Niyungeko, Burundi coach, believes that they have what it takes to contain Super Eagles when they meet at the forthcoming Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt. The coach, who spoke to CAFonline on the expectations of his side, noted that they had put the celebration over their maiden qualification behind and were now focused on playing well at the championship. As a result, the coach expressed the confidence that they would compete favourably against Nigeria in Group B as well as other countries pooled alongside them. “As much as we can celebrate, we can’t do it forever. The qualification is now behind us and the work has begun for us. We have to prepare and work hard to do well in the tournament,” Niyungeko told CAFonline. com. “My target is to ensure we do our best. We are not here to show weakness or participate. We are here to compete and show that our qualification was no fluke. There are 24 teams and each has equal chance and we are also part of that with an equal chance. “It is possible to reach any target we set and I believe in my players and that we can work hard and do well in this tournament. “It is a very tough group because apart from Madagascar; Nigeria and Guinea are teams who have experience playing in this competition. We will do our best, take a match at a time and represent Burundi in the best way we can.”

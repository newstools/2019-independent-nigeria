ABUJA – The Minister of Finance, Mrs. Zainab Shamsuna Ahmed, yesterday disclosed that Nigeria’s external reserve now stands at $44.69bn as at May 13, 2019, which grew from $28.3 billion in 2015. The minister made this known in her opening remarks at the quarterly World Press Conference, held in Abuja. She said similarly, Year-on-Year inflation rates continue to improve from a high rate of 18.7 per cent in January 2017 to 11.37 per cent in April 2019. Ahmed also disclosed that states would soon receive their outstanding balance of the Paris Club debts refunds based on the verification made on a total sum of N649.434bn by the ministry. “For the final phase of the Paris Club debts refunds, the total sum of N649.434bn was verified by the ministry as the outstanding balance to be refunded to the State Governments. “The payments made by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) as at March 2019, was N691.560bn. The increase in CBN payments partly arose from exchange rate differential at the point of payment. Although some States still have outstanding balances, which will be refunded in due course,” she said. According to her through the implementation of policies in the Economic Recovery & Growth Plan (ERGP), which the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration had developed in 2017 led to the economy’s exit from recession and move upwards on a path of sustainable, inclusive and diversified growth. She further maintained that it was the resolve of the ministry to address the long standing issue of “unsatisfactory revenue performance” in Nigeria, particularly in the non-oil sector, in order to ensure appropriate financing for critical sectors such as health, education, and infrastructure, and ultimately of co-creating a Nigeria where no one is left behind. She said: “Our External Reserves on the other hand, grew from $28.3bn in 2015 to US $44.69bn as at May 13, 2019 representing significant improvement that has helped stabilise the economy, including our currency exchange rates. Our Foreign Exchange (FX) market remained relatively stable from 2017 with the convergence of the NIFEX and NAFEX windows witnessed by November 2018. “Let me first underscore the vital role of domestic revenue mobilisation for continued economic success and inclusive growth in Nigeria. Indeed, President Muhammadu Buhari underscored the urgent need for improved revenue performance during his 2019 Budget Speech, and he directed the acceleration of all revenue initiatives.

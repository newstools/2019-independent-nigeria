Ahead of Saturday’s DFB-Pokal finale, Bayern Munich right back Joshua Kimmich acknowledged how dangerous of a scorer Timo Werner can be for RB Leipzig to Bundesliga.com. Werner, of course, will be one of the key players that Kimmich will have to try and contain if Bayern wants to secure a domestic double. He’s unbelievably quick, has a tremendous nose for goal and is a great finisher. He doesn’t take long to finish things off. He can score with his right, left and his head. Kimmich and Werner are teammates for Germany, but also have a bit of a history together. Werner was in the youth ranks with VfB Stuttgart from 2002 through 2016 before he moved to RB Leipzig, while Kimmich spent 2007 through 2013 at Stuttgart before he made his move to the burgeoning East German power in 2013. Kimmich later moved to Bayern in 2015. During his stay with Leipzig, which was only in Germany’s third division at the time, Kimmich knew the club was headed in the right direction. I expected they would get promoted to the Bundesliga and that they would do well there. But that they have become a top club so quickly is surprising for everyone. The 24-year-old Kimmich and the 23-year-old Werner look likely to have a long international career playing together for Die Mannschaft, but perhaps Bayern could push the friendly twosome closer together with an acquisition of Werner?

ADO-EKITI – Otunba Bisi Egbeyemi, Ekiti State Deputy Governor, has described last Friday’s Supreme Court verdict which validated Governor Kayode Fayemi’s election as “victory for all Ekiti people.” Egbeyemi also said that the emergence of Fayemi as the Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF) chairman is an opportunity to attract more federal presence to Ekiti. He called on the people in the state, especially politicians across political parties, to join hands with Fayemi in taking the state to an enviable height. In a statement on Sunday by his Special Assistant (Media), Odunayo Ogunmola, Egbeyemi urged politicians still aggrieved with Fayemi’s victory to sheathe their swords saying, “Politics of bitterness would not take the state to enviable position.” The Deputy Governor said Fayemi was ready to welcome ideas that could make the state attain a pride of place in the comity of states in Nigeria.

Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu, former Abia State governor and Senator-elect, Abia North Senatorial District, has urged Nigerians to sustain their support for the President Muhammadu Buhari’s Federal Government, adding that the second term of the administration will be used to consolidate on the achievements of the first. He said the efforts of President Buhari had manifested in all ramifications, stressing that the political class must desist from making inflammatory utterances capable of causing disharmony among Nigerians. Kalu, who faulted perpetrators of hate campaign for using political, religious and ethnic sentiments to mislead the unsuspecting public, urged Nigerians to resist politicians with no proven track record of achievements. While acknowledging the growing popularity of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the South East, Kalu urged the party’s leadership to consider Ndigbo for key appointments in all arms of government. In a statement signed by his media office on Tuesday, Kalu expressed appreciation to Nigerians for voting en masse for Buhari, adding that the future of Nigeria would be bright under the current administration. He said: “As Nigeria records another feat with the swearing in of President Muhammadu Buhari for a second term in office as Nigeria’s President, I am optimistic that this historic milestone will translate into a better life for Nigerians. “I equally salute the returning and new governors, who are being sworn in today as chief exceutives of their respective states. “The elections are over and it is now time for serious governance. The political class must live up to expectations at all levels of government.

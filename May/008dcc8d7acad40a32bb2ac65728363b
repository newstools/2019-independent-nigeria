LAGOS – The Nigerian U20 national team, the Flying Eagles, have arrived Poland on Sunday for the FIFA U20 World Cup due to start on Thursday. According to information from Ademola Olajire, the director of communications of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), the team arrived the Polish city of Katowice after rounding off a three-week residential training at Bad Gogging on the outskirts of Munich in Germany on Saturday. The Flying Eagles, Olajire noted, flew out of Germany via Munich on Sunday morning. They are to embark on the final leg of their preparations for the U-20 World Cup there in Katowice ahead of their opening Group D match on Friday against Qatar. “While in Bad Gogging, the team played four friendly games. These are a 3-3 draw with Freiburg U19s, a 1-2 loss to Saudi Arabia U20s, a 3-1 win over AFR Aelen and a 1-1 draw with Red Bull Salzburg. “These were to help in preparing them as they seek to win the FIFA U-20 World Cup for the first time,” Olajire said. The Flying Eagles are two-time runners-up at the competition in 1989 and 2005, and took the bronze medals at the 1985 finals. The statement quoted the team captain, Ikouwem Udoh- Utin, as saying that the camping exercise in Germany has helped the team to blend very well. “Our time in Germany has really helped us to come together as a group, blend with one another, as well as learn new things from our coaches. “It has been a wonderful experience in camp, because the boys now understand one another better and we have perfected our plans as we go into the tournament. “We want to make Nigeria proud in Poland and we will do our best not to disappoint Nigerians “Our aim is to go all out and win the trophy for Nigeria. We also want to thank the NFF and Nigerians for their support and we will go there and represent Nigeria well,” Utin said.

LAGOS – A co-defendant of a suspected kidnap kingpin, Chukwudumeme Onwuamadike alias Evans, yesterday told an Igbosere High Court in Lagos how he undergone a surgery that allegedly failed in the prison. The defendant, Linus Okpara, is standing trial alongside suspected billionaire kidnap kingpin, Evans, and others and they are presently being remanded at the kirikiri Maximum Security prison. Okpara is the third of four defendants in the second attempted murder, conspiracy to kidnap and selling of firearms charge filed against them by the Lagos State Government before Justice Adedayo Akintoye. At the last adjourned date, Okpara’s new counsel, Mr C. J. Jiakponna, informed the court that his client had a bail application because of an unresolved health challenge. The judge adjourned till yesterday for Jiakponna to serve prosecution counsel, Mr Y. G. Oshoala, the application. At the resume of The proceedings, neither Jiakponna nor any member of the defence team was available, and the judge stood down proceedings at 09:22am to wait for them. At about 10:05am when the court reconvened, Jiakponna did not move the bail application. He however moved another application seeking an order compelling the Medical Director of the Kirikiri Maximum Security Prison to issue a medical report on Okpara’s state of health. “The application had a failed operation which might require treatment at an outside hospital. If, at the end of the day, the medical report says he can be managed in the prison, we will not be able to move his (bail) application. “We urge your lordship to grant this application. The law places a high premium on a human’s life.” The prosecution did not challenge him.

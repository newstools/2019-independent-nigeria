LAGOS – The Ijaw Youth Congress (IYC) Worldwide on Wednesday warned the Bini ethnic nationality over alleged continued encroachment of Gelegelegbene lands by the Oba of Benin and his subjects, saying the silent war of aggression against the Ijaws in Edo State, particularly the people of Gelegelegbene, was getting to an alarming rate that the Ijaw nation Would no longer fold its arms anymore. Barrister Pereotubo R. Oweilaemi, President, IYC Worldwide, in a statement made available to DAILY INDEPENDENT on Wednesday, maintained that the alleged unprovoked trespassing of the Gelegelegbene lands by the Bini monarch on daily basis was a declaration of fratricidal war against the Ijaw nation, which would no longer be tolerated.

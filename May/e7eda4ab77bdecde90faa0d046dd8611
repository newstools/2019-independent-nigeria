The operatives of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Lagos State command have busted a syndicate of illicit drug merchants who attempted to move a large consignment of Cannabis Sativa into Lagos. The command we gathered had on Friday May 3, 2019 at about 1.30pm intercepted a 20 foot MAN Diesel truck with Registration No. JJJ 959 XN laden with 150 bags of Cannabis Sativa with the estimated street value worth over N20 million, weighing 2.139 tons concealed in a fake compartment of the truck. According to the Acting State Commander, Barrister Frederick Ezeorah, two male suspects; Monday Michael, the driver, aged 46 years and Alex Adieli his conductor aged 43, were also apprehended on their way from Ondo State to Lagos. He said the suspect during interrogation by NDLEA officials said he has been in the illicit dealings for years without being caught. He appealed to NDLEA to be left off the hook as he will desist from the business. According to Ezeorah, the achievement came as a result of intelligence gathered over a period of time on the criminal activities of the suspects who specialise in bringing such illicit substances into Lagos State. He added that the consequences of trafficking in illicit drugs and abuse of dangerous substances must be the concern of every well-meaning Nigerians; the effect knows no bound and anybody can be a victim of its dangerous health and mental implications, violence and its associated crimes. The commander while commending the operatives who arrested the suspects described the seizure as a panacea for peace and positive step towards eradicating illicit drugs from circulation.

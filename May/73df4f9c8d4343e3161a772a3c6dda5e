LAGOS – Sunday Oliseh, former Super Eagles captain and chief coach, has expressed sadness over exit of one of his former clubs, Ajax Amsterdam of Holland in the semifinals of this year’s UEFA Champions League (UCL). Oliseh admitted it was sad seeing the Dutch side fall 3-2 at home against Tottenham Hotspurs, who overturned a 1-0 loss they suffered against Ajax in the first leg, and the English Premier League (EPL) outfit moved into the final, in which they will face EPL title contenders, Liverpool on June 1. The 2019 UCL at Wanda Metropolitana in Madrid, Spain will be an all-England final but, while acknowledging that Spurs deserved their win on Wednesday, Oliseh admitted he was sad to see it happen. “Credit to Pochettino’s Tottenham for the fighting spirit and above all, the second half tactical change that defeated Ajax. “Sad for my dear Ajax, what a horrible way to lose a champion’s league semi-final. What a superb Year of football!” he posted. Oliseh confessed that Ajax’s defeat by Spurs in the second leg of their last-four fixture at Johan Cruyff Arena was horrible for Erik ten Hag’s side, especially as they started the game impressively with first-half goals from Matthijs de Ligt and Hakim Ziyech. However, Spurs roared back and turned the apple cart with a second-half hat-trick by Lucas Moura, much to the utter dismay of Oliseh, who hit eight goals in 54 appearances during two years with the Dutch side.

ONITSHA – Three persons among the victims of the collapsed four storey building in Onitsha are still trapped under the rubbles as rescue workers are finding it difficult to locate them. The building located at Ogalonye/ Ezenwa Street, Onitsha was under construction before it collapsed on Wednesday afternoon leaving some of the workers trapped under the rubble. As at 8pm on Wednesday, rescue workers and sympathisers were still crowded in the area where a rescue operation was ongoing. Two victims were believed to have been rescued alive by rescue workers and immediately taken to the hospital for prompt medical attention. A victim believed to have died under the rubbles was transferred into a waiting hospital ambulance as at 8:15pm of the day of the incident. When our reporter arrived the scene to ascertain the latest development on Thursday morning, thousands of sympathisers made up of school children, artisans and mostly traders stayed behind discussing the incident. Though, an excavator which assisted in the rescue operation of the victims was still on the site, no feasible activities was seen going on. One of the persons interviewed at the scene told our reporter that the driver had worked tirelessly throughout the previous night and might have possibly gone to rest. The source also disclosed that the rescue operators might be finding it difficult to ascertain the exact location of the people still trapped under the rubbles and were afraid of mutilating the victims’ bodies either dead or alive as the rescue workers do not possess the necessary technology to carry out a perfect rescue operation.

IBADAN – About 65 teachers of the University of Ibadan Staff School, Ibadan, have protested against the removal of their names from the payroll of the university workforce. The peaceful protest was led by the chairman, Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities (SSANU), UI chapter, Wale Akinremi, in company of his Non-Academic Staff Union (NASU) counterpart, Malachi Etim. Akinremi, who said about 65 teachers were currently affected, further disclosed that the union took up the matter after a congress resolution, and had written a letter in May 2019, in that direction to the institution’s Vice Chancellor, Professor Idowu Olayinka. He added that when the management tarried in honouring the letter or even acknowledged it, they resolved to public protest to press home their demand, adding that they were ready to work with the management to finally lay the matter to rest. Akinremi said: “the whole scenario emanated from a letter from the Federal Government, which was misinterpreted to remove teachers of staff school from pay roll of federal universities. “The same Federal Government took us to the industrial court and specifically in suit number NICN/ ABJ/82/2016, judgement dated December 5, 2016, the court ruled in favour of the staff unions upholding that the university shall bear the full capital and recurrent costs of university staff primary schools.

Hilary Duff has announced she is engaged to her boyfriend, Matthew Koma. In a report through her.ie, the singer and actress took to Instagram on Thursday to confirm the news, sharing a series of sweet photos (which also showed off her ring). “He asked me to be his wife,” she captioned the series of photos, alongside a red heart emoji. Koma shared the same series of photos on his own account, telling his followers he had “asked my best friend to marry me.” The couple first got together in early 2017, before splitting in March that year. They rekindled things a few months later, and have been going strong since then. In June last year, the 31-year-old announced that she and Koma were expecting their first child together. Their daughter, Banks, was born in October last year. The actress confirmed Banks’ arrival with an adorable photo of the three of them, praising her as “absolute magic.”

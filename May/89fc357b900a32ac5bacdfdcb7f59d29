A new report by Nigeria’s telecommunications industry regulator, Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), shows that the digital transformation giants, Globacom, have remained the preferred data operator in the industry. The report, which is NCC’s assessment of the industry’s internet subscriber Data for March 2019, indicated that Globacom added nearly one million new subscribers that month. According to the data published on the website of NCC, Globacom recorded the highest number of internet subscribers for the month with 950,115 new internet users. Thus the service provider’s internet subscription in March moved to 28,436,386 from 27,486,271 in February. The NCC data equally showed that MTN and Airtel also recorded gains in March, with Airtel adding 351,657 new internet users in the month under review and MTN recording an increase of 13,552 subscribers for the month. 9mobile, in contrast, continued to record losses in its internet subscriber base as it lost 166,542 users in March. A general overview of the NCC data showed that internet users in Nigeria increased to 115,938,225 in March from 114,725,357 recorded in February. This indicates an increase of 1,212,868 new subscribers in one month. This means Globacom accounted for over 78 percent of the growth.

LAGOS – The Net Work On Police Reforms in Nigeria (NOPRIN) has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to assent to the Police Reform Bill. NOPRIN also urged the House of Representatives to fast-track the bill and quickly transmit to the President, saying that passage of the bill into law will curb police brutality and reduce to the barest minimum the excesses and ills in the force. Okechukwu Nwanguma, National Coordinator, NOPRIN in an interview with Saturday INDEPENDENT said the passage of the bill became necessary due to police brutality, which he added was a longstanding problem in Nigeria. According to him, this problem has in recent times assumed epidemic proportions. “It is increasing in both frequency and in the number of citizens killed through torture or reckless misuse of firearms by police officers. Between June 4, 2018 when police in Abuja killed Linda Nkechi Igwetu, the female National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) member, just one day to her passing out, and April 13, 2019 when the police in Lagos again killed Ada Ifeanyi, 20, in the company of her male friend who was also shot by the same policeman who eventually fled and was declared wanted by the Lagos State Police Command.”

Washington Post opinion columnist Dana Milbank wrote Wednesday that the White House has been quietly and insidiously yanking press credentials from the majority of the press corps on the basis of a White House attendance policy so stringent even the President may not meet it. According to Milbank, the standard is that the reporter must have been at the White House in person at least 90 of the past 180 days, an unrealistic standard given normal travel needs and the scarcity of official press room briefings. In a report through talkingpointsmemo.com, the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Some reporters have successfully fought to be reinstated under an “exception,” meaning that they essentially can work until Trump no longer wants them around. Milbank’s appeal was unsuccessful. “The Post requested exceptions for its seven White House reporters and for me, saying that this access is essential to our work (in my case, I often write “sketches” describing the White House scene),” he wrote. “The White House press office granted exceptions to the other seven, but not to me. I strongly suspect it’s because I’m a Trump critic.”

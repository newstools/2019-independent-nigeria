LAGOS – Ibadan, the Oyo State capital can now boast of Inland Dry Port (IDP) and the development that follows such massive project. The project became a reality with the State Government’s provision of large expanse of land for it. Abiola Ajimobi, the Oyo State outgoing Governor, who handed over the vital documents for the 90 hectares of land approved for the construction of the project to Rotimi Amaechi, the Minister of Transport, at the Council Chamber of the Governor’s Office in Ibadan, in respect of the land located at Olorisa-Oko village in Akinyele Local Government Area of Oyo State, said the state is “out to bring more good news to the people in the next few years”.

Amaechi , while receiving the document noted that the port project was conceived to decongest the Apapa Seaport, ease gridlock on the Apapa expressway and engender massive employment as well as improve the government’s Internally Generated Revenue. Amaechi said while some containers and commercial goods would be transported through the ongoing standard gauge railway to Ibadan to ease the gridlock in Apapa and boost employment opportunities in Oyo state, he however warned that the state should be prepared for the attendant traffic gridlock that may come with it.

Mr Isiyaku Bala Tilde, SEC Acting Executive Commissioner Operations, was quoted by the statement as saying that streamlining the process was a major milestone. “Streamlining the issuance process with the listing process of the NSE is a major milestone for the Commission in its quest to create an enabling environment capable of attracting New Listings. “One of our core values is leading by example, and we hope that other stakeholders will also look inward to explore similar initiatives which will ensure quick time to market of securities in our market. “We have no doubt that the streamlined process will enhance the competitiveness of the Nigerian capital market as a global investment destination,” tilde said.

Political forces in Sudan are planning to establish a parliamentary republic with expanded powers of the government and parliament for a transitional period, a spokesman for the opposition Forces for the Declaration of Freedom and Change, Satia Alhaj, said on Friday. Alhaj also said that talks between Sudan’s Transitional Military Council and opposition movement Forces for the Declaration of Freedom and Change on the makeup of the future sovereign council for governing the country were not suspended but stopped. He added that the opposition alliance is capable of making Sudanese people’s wishes come true, as it is supported by at least 8 million people in the country. On 15 May, the TMC and the opposition agreed on a three-year transitional period. Sudan experienced a military coup on 11 April following four months of anti-government protests. President Omar Bashir, who had been in power for 30 years, was overthrown and then imprisoned. The TMC came to power and pledged to hold a new election within two years. However, the opposition did not approve of this plan and called on the TMC to immediately hand over power to civilian structures.

Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Lagos – Following their 2-0 loss to the U20 in their second group match on Monday, the Flying Eagles will today play Ukraine in a must win match if they must qualify for the next round of the competition in Poland. While Nigeria beat Qatar 4-0 in the opening game, USA lost their 1-2 to Ukraine. Ukraine top Group D with six points after wins over America and Qatar and Nigeria are second with three points and +2 goals aggregate while the United States are third with three points and +1 goals difference and Qatar are last with no point and -5 goals difference. A win for Nigeria will all but throw the group open because FIFA rule considers goals difference before head-to-head. Ukraine have +2 goals aggregate – the same with Nigeria –  and must avoid a defeat against the Flying Eagles to be assured of qualification. Meanwhile, a win for Nigeria will all but guarantee Nigeria’s passage to the next round of the competition and expectedly, the Americans will be expected to lord it over the group’s whipping boys, Qatar. Speaking ahead of the match today, Coach Paul Aigbogun said that the Nigerians lads would go all out to get the qualification into the next round by beating Ukraine. “We apologise for the defeat (to USA) but we are assuring Nigerians that they shall see an improved team against Ukraine. “The boys were not happy with their performance and they were all distraught after the game. They have been told what they must improve on. It was not that they were totally poor against USA, but the goals they scored against us had a telling effect on them and they were unable to recover.”

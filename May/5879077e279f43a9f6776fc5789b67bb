Powered by RubiQube Ad Network A nurse, Mrs Ebele (surname withheld) on Thursday narrated to an Ikeja Sexual Offences and Domestic Violence Court how her male housekeeper allegedly defiled her six-year-old daughter and seven-year-old niece. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the nurse made the claim while giving evidence at the trial of the housekeeper, Bright Izuchukwu, aged 27. Izuchukwu is facing a two-count charge of defilement, contrary to Section 137 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The nurse, who was led in evidence by prosecution counsel, Mrs Arinola Momoh-Ayokanbi, told the court that she employed the defendant from December 2016 to June 2018 at her home in Festac Town, Lagos. She said that the defendant used his knowledge of the location of a Close Circuit Television (CCTV) installed in house to avoid being captured when he committed the crime. She said: “I laid Izuchukwu off because he was not performing his duties. I always gave my daughter sex education and from time to time, I ask my daughter whether anyone touched her private parts. “On the 17 or 18 July 2018, I asked her if anyone touched her private part. She said Izuchukwu used to place her on his laps and insert his fingers into her private part and he subsequently inserted his penis into her vagina.”

ADO-EKITI – The Director General , Buhari/ Osinbajo Campaign Council in the 2019 general elections,Dr Olusegun Osinkolu, has berated some members of the All Progressives Congress(APC) in Ekiti for attacking Governor Kayode Fayemi over political appointments made so far . Speaking in Ado Ekiti ,the APC chieftain said Governor Fayemi had shown high level of respect ,tolerance and magnanimity in the way and manner he handled issues relating to appointments . Inspite of initial bad blood occasioned by last governorship primaries where about 40 aspirants participated ,Osinkolu argued the governor was able to extend olive branch to all caucuses in the party . He applauded Governor Kayode Fayemi for promoting unity in the party by spreading political appointments across the party. “ In my opinion and contrary to what some believed , Governor Fayemi had proved to be leader to all in APC. His appointments have gone round all the known caucuses.In spite of the bad blood the May 12, 2018 governorship primary elicited among the 33 contenders, over ten of them have been elected or appointed through Governor Fayemi’s influence in the party.

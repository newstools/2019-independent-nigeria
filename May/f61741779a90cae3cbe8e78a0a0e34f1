BAUCHI – A High Court sitting in Bauchi yesterday restrained Governor Mohammad Abubakar of Bauchi State from awarding a N4.5 billion contract under the state’s Universal Basic Education Board a few days to the end of his tenure. Justice S. I. Zadawa, the the presiding judge, granted an order of interim injunction in a suit filed by two plaintiffs – the Body of Bauchi Lawyers of Conscience and the Bauchi Assembly of Youths Political Actors. The two plaintiffs had prayed the court to stop the defendants from awarding the contract saying “it is an unprogressive action” and a planned financial trap for the incoming administration of Senator Bala Mohammed, who would be inaugurated as the next governor on May 29.

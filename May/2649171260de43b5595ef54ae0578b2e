Music, video and copyright technology intellectual property rights company One Media iP Group has on Thursday, told shareholders that it was pleased with continued development following a year of “strategic progress” in 2018. In a report through sharecast, the AIM-traded firm, which was holding its annual general meeting, said that its strategy was the continued expansion of its catalogue of music rights. Chairman Ian Dunleavy said it had made two initial acquisitions in the current year, which he said further broadened the breadth and depth of content in the One Media library to include Spanish and country music. “These genres have proven global followings, particularly in Latin America, which has seen the highest rate of music revenue growth globally for four consecutive years according to research by the IFPI,” he told investors. “We look forward to the future with confidence, as our pipeline of deals continues to expand and we expect the pace of our music rights acquisitions to accelerate.”

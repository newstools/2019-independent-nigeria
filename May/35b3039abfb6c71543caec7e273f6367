CHARLES ONYEKAMUO AWKA – The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has described as worrisome the fact that over 70 percent of traders in the Nigerian markets do not know of the Federal Government’s policy on NCC or their rights as telecom consumers in the country. Banji Ojo, Head, Consumer Protection and Advocacy Consumer Affairs Bureau of NCC, made the disclosure during telecommunication awareness campaign his organisation held for traders at the Onitsha main market in Anambra State on Thursday. The campaign was organised in partnership with African Entrepreneurial and Human Development Initiative (AEDI) to sensitise traders in Onitsha on government’s policy on NCC and their rights as telecom consumers. According to Ojo, their findings from the questionnaires administered on traders at Karu Market in Abuja and Kano main market in Kano state revealed that traders in major markets nationwide were ignorant of the policies of government on NCC, which regulates the operations of telecommunication companies in Nigeria and their rights on such things as rights to quality service, to be heard and fair complaint process, accurate, clearly worded and organized bills, action on dispute charges, safety to choose and be informed among others. For these reasons, the regulatory body, he said, decided to take the awareness campaign to the traders in their markets because they also discovered that these trades hardly spare the time or leave their shops to read the government policies or attend to many of the programmes like the Town Hall meeting or the NCC consumer parliament where these issues are explained.

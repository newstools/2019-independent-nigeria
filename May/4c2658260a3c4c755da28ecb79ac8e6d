BENIN – The 7th Edition of Okpekpe International Road Race scheduled for May 25th, 2019 may not hold, following plans by the people of Apana Community in Etsako West Local Government Area of Edo state to stop the Race, over what they described as “erroneous tagging” of the event. Apana people, who are demanding the reflection of their community name on the Race banners and emblem, stated that, the take-off point of the event form major part of their land hence the need to name it, ‘Apana/Okpekpe Road Race’ and not ‘Okpekpe Road Race’, as it is currently being used. The race is an annual event that gathers world-class athletes from around the world for a 10-kilometre distance. It is an IAAF Silver Label race with the sum of N45m as total prize money for this year’s event. In a petition to the State Government, signed by Notary Public, Apeiye Becon Clement Esq. on behalf of the community, the community called for correction of what they termed “error”, to avert future dispute between Apana and Okpekpe Communities. According to the petition, “Wishing to further place on record is the fact that Apana Uzairue is the closest community on the ground that we share boundary with Okpekpe Clan and this boundary determines the boundary between Uzairue Clan and Okpekpe Clan and Etsako West local government and Etsako East Local Government. “Flowing from the above stated fact, Okpekpe Clan is claiming that the take-off of the race is now the boundary between Apana-Uzairue and Okpekpe Clan, and this is not true as the take-off of the race form part of Apana-Uzairue, Etsako West Local Government Area as such is calling on your intervention to avoid a breach of peace.” An indigene in the community, Elder Thomas Ipogah however stated that, after series of reminder on the petition to concerned authorities, with no response, the community may resort to disrupt the race take-off.

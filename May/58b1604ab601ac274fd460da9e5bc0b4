Powered by RubiQube Ad Network LAGOS – Switch, a revolutionary new app, which eliminates transaction fees on transfers, has been launched in Nigeria. The application, which was unveiled on Monday in Lagos, the management said would erase all the fees charged on financial transfer. Mrs. Seun Runsewe, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Switch, in an interview with journalists at the unveiling said that the app was available to Nigerians in the United Kingdom, United States and the Nigerian market with plans to expand its application to other countries in the future. Runsewe explained that Switch is a naira savings account with 10 per cent interest on savings and providing access to a range of new lending, investment and insurance opportunities in Nigeria, with better rates. She added that plans are also on for the app to start rolling out a multicurrency savings feature before the end of the year, thereby giving UK and US users the benefit of having and operating a Great Britain Pound (GBP), United States Dollars (USD) and Euro denominated account, alongside their naira accounts. She insisted that the free and easy-to-use app is the only facilitator of completely free money transfers between the UK and Nigeria. She explained that the World Bank in its 2017 statistics reported that Nigerians living abroad repatriated a total sum of $22bn in 2017, representing a 16.4 per cent increase from the amount returned in 2016.

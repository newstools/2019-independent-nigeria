James Arthur has encouraged men suffering with mental health issues to speak out following the tragic death of Love Island’s Mike Thalassitis. The X Factor winner has bravely opened up about suffering panic attacks and mental health issues, whilst sharing his sadness over Mike’s death. Speaking exclusively to Mirror Online backstage at Radio 1’s Big Weekend, he said: “It’s tragic and people need to speak up more if they’re having problems. “There seems to be an attitude around men that if you speak about your mental health you’re admitting weakness and that’s not the case.” He later apologised and was welcomed back to Syco two years later. He told us: “It does feel different this time because I’ve stopped worrying as much and am just enjoying making the music I want to make.” Mike died in March at the age of 26 in a suspected suicide. Following his tragic death, there have been calls from a number of reality stars, including X Factor’s Lucy Spraggan, have called for better aftercare for contestants leaving shows of that nature. * Catch all the action from Radio 1’s Big Weekend in Middlesbrough across TV, radio and online on the May bank holiday weekend .

With the onset of its season of scarcity, prices of fresh tomatoes and pepper which started escalating before the Easter celebrations have not declined, but instead on steady rise. The absence of fresh tomatoes from neighbouring countries such as Ghana, Cameroun and Niger Republic has also not helped the situation either, as they are also experiencing off-season effect. The steady rise on the prices of the produce had an adverse effect on Lagos consumers last Saturday, as they had to pay through their noses to buy the produce. Besides, they were not available as only few traders had them in stock. The law of demand and supply had to come into play, dictating the prices of the produce. Many of the traders said they were not taken aback at the development, stressing that the produce are usually expensive during the planting season. During the week, visits to some markets across the states by the Business and Market Intelligence Unit of SUNDAY INDEPENDENT indicated that prices of the produce  in most of the markets visited, soared significantly, especially when compared with what they  were  sold between April and May 9, 2019. Reasons for the increase in the prices of the produce were attributed to seasonal factors, high demand resulting from scarcity and their unavailability. At the Ogbeogologo and Igbudu markets, Delta State, prices of the produce soared sharply as a big basket of               fresh tomatoes attracted between N18,000 and N22,000, up from  between N12,500 and N13,500 initially sold, while that of fresh pepper increased, currently selling within the region of N14,500 and N15,000 as against between N8,500 and N9,000 sold previously. Prices, however, depend on the size of the basket, specie and the haggling power of the buyer. Mallam Yakub Idrisu, who sells the produce at the Ogbeogologo Market, Asaba, linked the situation to inadequate supply. For that of Nkwo Nnewi Market, the situation was not different as prices of a big basket of fresh tomatoes that were formerly sold for between N12,800 and N13,500 rose to between N18,500 and N19,500, of which many of the traders attributed to high demand and  high cost of logistics. That of a bag of fresh pepper also witnessed the same trend, increasing to N15,500 from N13,000 earlier sold. At the Ose Mraket, Onitsha, prices of a basket of fresh tomatoes currently goes for N17,000 as against  between N11,500 and N12,000 sold before. That of fresh pepper which formerly attracted between N9,500 and N10,000 rose to N14,000 within the review week. Madam Regina Azu, who retails the produce at the Ose Market, Onitsha, in a chat with SUNDAY INDEPENDENT connected the hike to off-season effect. In Achau Market, Kaduna, prices of the produce were at an upward trend, especially with the prices of a basket of fresh tomatoes currently going for between N6,000 and N6,500 as against N5,000 sold last month. While that of a bag of fresh pepper that previously went for between N7,500 and N7,000 escalated, currently ranging from N9,700 to N10,000. Mr. Garba Ameen, who trades in the produce, blamed the increase to scarcity and high demand usually associated with the season of lack. In Wuse Market, Abuja, prices of fresh tomatoes were also on a steady rise since the Easter celebrations. For example, prices of a basket of fresh tomatoes that previously went for between N3,500 and N4,000 attracted  between N6,000 and N6,700. Likewise that of fresh pepper, increasing to between N9,500 and N10,000 from N7,000 initially sold. Many of the traders in Wuse market, Abuja, ascribed the increase to shortfall in supply. The same could be said for Tella Market, Taraba State, as a big basket of fresh tomatoes that was earlier sold for between N2,500 and N3,000  attracted N5,500 in the week under review. Most of the traders related the situation to seasonal factors coupled with the commencement of Ramadan fast by Muslims faithful also triggered the prices. At the Lafenwa Market, Ogun State, prices of a big basket of fresh tomatoes that were  formerly sold for between N8,000 and N8,500 increased by over 10 percent, currently ranging from N9,000 to N9,500 depending on the size of the basket and haggling power of the customer. Also, that of a bag of fresh pepper, escalated to between N11,500 and N11,000 from N9,000 previously sold. Mr. Akeem Oreoluwa, who sells the produce at the Lafenwa Market, Ogun State, attributed the hike to inadequate supply, resulting from scarcity and off-season effect. For Bodija Market, Ibadan, the situation was not different, especially with prices of a basket of fresh tomatoes currently going for between N6,500 and N7,500 up from between N4,500 and N5,500 sold a fortnight ago. This, however, depends on the size of the basket, specie and bargaining power of the buyer. Similarly, that of a bag of fresh pepper also skyrocketed, currently selling for between N11,000 and N11,500 as against N10,000 sold earlier. Many of the traders connected the hike to high demand owing to inadequate supply from the North. In Lagos, visit to popular Mile 12 market; revealed that the produce was not adequately supplied as only few trucks were sighted offloading. The effect of the increase was also evident in the purchases of traders as some of them could no longer continue with their normal supplies. Prices of fresh tomatoes and pepper worsened the more to the dismay of consumers. For example, prices of a basket of fresh tomatoes previously sold for between N4,500  and N5,000 grew to between N6,500 and N7,000 within the review week while that of fresh pepper also snowballed  to between N12,000 and N13,000 from N11,000 initially sold. Mr. Gbenga Anisere, who sells the produce at the Mile 12 Market, blamed the situation to scarcity and high cost of transportation.

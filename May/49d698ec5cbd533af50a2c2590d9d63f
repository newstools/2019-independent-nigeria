Lagos – Henry Nwosu and Ike Shorunmu, two former Super Eagles players have hailed the composition of the list released on Tuesday by Coach Gernot Rohr for the forthcoming Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt. The list saw the return of Captain John Mikel Obi, as well as Leicester City’s Kelechi Iheanacho, even as Ogenyi Onazi was conspicuously missing. The 1980 Africa Cup of Nations winner, Nwosu, said that since it was the prerogative of the coach to name the players he was comfortable to work with, it was imperative that he be supported with the list, while also saying that it was a nice list. “The coach has made his choice and me as a person, it is a nice list because it contains virtually our best players right now. We need to support him,” he said. Ike Shorunmu, the former goalkeeper of the team, said it was a nice composition. He noted that the return of Mikel to the team was a good development because the Middleborough captain, he acknowledged, would bring his wealth of experience into the team. “It is a good list from all angle one wants to look at it. Is there any Nigerian top performer that is not there? I don’t think so, so we have to applaud the coach and the NFF. I particularly like the return of Mikel because he is one player with a lot of experience and we are going to feel it in Egypt,” he said.

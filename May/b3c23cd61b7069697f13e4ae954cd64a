ABEOKUTA – Governor Ibikunle Amosun of Ogun State, on Thursday, said the ongoing construction work along IBB Boulverd, Kuto, Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, was to make the inauguration of the governor-elect, Dapo Abiodun, convenient. Amosun, in a press statement signed by his Special Adviser on Information and Strategy, Rotimi Durojaiye, said the intention of the state government was contrary to the allegation making the rounds that the construction was to make the inauguration process unsuccessful. Amosun said the closure of the road was also to ensure rapid work on the axis to allow free passage of President Muhammadu Buhari, who is bid to visit the state on Friday for project commissioning. He said the incoming administration was the first to benefit from the gesture with a seamless inauguration lecture held, Thursday, at the June 12 Cultural Center in the same axis. The governor also took a swipe at the office of the Police Public Relations Officer of the Ogun State Command over a recent press statement allegedly unraveling a planned disruption of the inauguration. While describing the statement as reckless, Amosun said the police have been engaged and would hope that they are not a tool in the hand of the fifth columnists. The statement read, “The attention of the Ogun State Government has been drawn to several unfounded allegations and innuendos trending in the public space with regard to the upcoming inauguration of the new administration. “Two of such unsavoury allegations are worthy of mention here. The first was that government deliberately blocked the road and approach leading to the June 12 Cultural Centre venue of pre-Inauguration activities. “The second, rather more reckless, was the story credited the Police Public Relations Officer, Ogun State Command, that the police had uncovered a phantom ploy to disrupt the upcoming inauguration activities. We will hope

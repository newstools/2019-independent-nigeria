President of the National Fuel Society of Angola (Sonangol), Sebastiao Martins, has guaranteed the current existence in the country of sufficient fuels to satisfy the demand. Martins’ statements were issued on Thursday after the 5th ordinary meeting of the Economic Commission of the Council of Ministers, led by President Joao Lourenzo. There is a schedule for refined products to arrive in time to be distributed so as not to cause a disruption such as the one in early May, when service stations in most of the country’s 18 provinces -with a particular incidence in Luanda- had no fuel. The new Sonangol President has stated difficulties with the transfer of gasoline and diesel to provinces such as North and South Lunda due to the bad condition of roads. The so-called fuel crisis led to the removal of Sonangol’s president Carlos Saturnino, who replaced in late 2017 the daughter of former president Jose Eduardo dos Santos, Isabel dos Santos. Angola barely refines 20 percent of its needs in the only existing refinery, Luanda. Two refineries are being planned, one in Cabinda and the other in Lobito, both by 2021 or 2022.

Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Goalkeepers will be forced to play outfield and vice versa due to rule changes set to be introduced next season. As part of the respect campaign, the Football Association is extending its trial of sin-bins outside of the Football League. Thirty one leagues from across the country at Step 7 and below of the national league system and Tier 5 and below of the women’s pyramid has previously taken part. Now the fifth step of non-league downwards will be using sin-bins in place of yellow cards for dissent. Players will be sin-binned for 10 minutes in the event of a dissent offence, with outfield players having to go in goal if goalkeepers are on the sidelines. Keepers will also have to play outfield when they return to the field until there is a stoppage in play. Regulations state: “In the case of a goalkeeper being sin-binned, an outfield player must take over his position for the 10-minute period. “On completing his/her sin bin period, the goalkeeper must re-enter the field of play as an outfield player, until which time there is a stoppage in play enabling him to change position.” The referee will call the player back on the pitch while play continues until a stoppage takes place.

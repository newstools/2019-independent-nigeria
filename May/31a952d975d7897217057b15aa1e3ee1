Manchester United have confirmed that Ander Herrera will be leaving the club this summer following five years with the Old Trafford side. Rumours of interest from Paris Saint-Germain have circulated for some time as the 29-year-old entered the final year of his contract with the Red Devils, with free agency beckoning from the beginning of July. The tenacious midfielder is yet to make any announcements regarding his next destination, however, but did take time to bid farewell to a club at which he won the FA Cup, Carabao Cup and Europa League. “There is red in my heart, I knew it from the first time I played here and in the moment that I started to wear it,” the Spaniard expressed in a farewell video released by the club. “A club with thousands of fans that respect and remember all the players who give everything. “I felt special when I heard my name chanted. I felt proud when the fans decided I was part of this incredible history. “Every time I represented this club, in every game, in wins and loses, even when I couldn’t help from the grass, I understood what this club means. “I am going to remember each of the almost 200 matches that I have played with this jersey. Because playing for the greatest club in England has been a true honour. “Thanks for these five amazing years.” Although United coach Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said in March that he hoped Herrera would stay at Old Trafford, he hinted on Friday that the midfielder looked set to leave and might make his last appearance for the club as they finish the season with a home game against Cardiff. “Ander might play [against Cardiff], I don’t know yet,” he told reporters. “We haven’t picked the team and he’s probably going to announce himself later on where he’s going to continue his football.” Herrera joined United in 2014 from Athletic Club and has since gone on to make 189 appearances, scoring 20 goals. He has featured 22 times in the Premier League this season, starting 16 of those.

Manchester City clinched an unprecedented domestic treble by winning the FA Cup with a 6-0 thrashing of Watford at Wembley on Saturday, equalling the record for the biggest win in the competition’s final. City needed penalties to beat Chelsea in the EFL Cup final and were run extremely close by Liverpool in the Premier League, but Saturday’s triumph was a procession as City rounded off an historic campaign in incredible fashion. Although the first big chance of the game was created by Watford, a dominant City made them pay just before the half-hour with David Silva’s first goal since December and Raheem Sterling doubling their advantage with 38 minutes on the clock. Watford’s positive start to the second period was futile and ruthless City swept them away in style, as Jesus set up substitute Kevin De Bruyne and then got in on the act himself. Sterling rounded off a glorious day for Guardiola’s men by completing his hat-trick with two in the last nine minutes. For all of City’s early domination, the first opportunity fell to Watford on the break in the 10th minute. Gerard Deulofeu led the counter down the right and his cross was perfect for Roberto Pereyra but the Argentinian’s shot was blocked by the outrushing Ederson. Pep Guardiola after the game said, “Of course it was an incredible final for us, not for Watford but it is what it is. For everyone it’s a big congratulations the staff and the players. “One team is going to do it again, then another team can do it but we were the first. We have to improve.”

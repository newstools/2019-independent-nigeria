In press conference at the French Open Rafael Nadal revealed how he spent his two days off after his success in Rome. “I have been at home, one day of golf, one day of family, and came back here. Good. Having already two practices here. Good practices. Just trying to continue the preparation and just hold the level”, said Nadal. On how different the Philippe Chatrier plays now that it is going through renovations, Nadal added: “The feeling with the ball, the feeling with the court, personally I had the same feeling on court. No, no, I don’t see a difference in terms of game experience, you know. I think the wind is going the same way, and the feeling on court is exactly the same. Then, of course, is a different court, and especially is a little bit different looking from, behind the royal box. For me, that’s the main difference. Asked if he only knows who is his first round opponent is or if he checks the draw, he replied: I just checked the draw. I like tennis, and I am not these ones that I don’t want to know anything about the draw, no. For me is a very normal thing, look at the draw, no? No, no, is not totally about myself. Is about, you know, some friends that are playing, half the players from the academy are playing here too. Checking a little bit the draw for everybody, and I like to know a little bit the matches that are playing in the first round.” “When it’s too windy in the academy I go to the indoor (smiling). For me is not — no. Of course, being from an island, we have wind, yes. But if you ask me if I prefer to play with wind or without, I prefer to play without. Another thing is normally I adapt myself well to that windy conditions.”

Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Israel stormed the house of Jerusalemite Hanadi Al-Halawani and arrested her this morning, local activists have reported. Al-Halawani, a teacher at Al-Aqsa Mosque schools, is an activist who has been going to the Muslim holy site to serve the iftar, break fast meal, to those who are fasting. Videos circulating on social media show her leading chants against the occupation at the site. This is not the first time that Al-Halawani has been arrested. In May last year Israeli occupation authorities banned her from entering the Old City of Jerusalem for three months. The order came just days after a previous ban on her access to the area had expired. Al-Halawani is one of a group of Palestinians who voluntarily remains at Al-Aqsa to watch over it, in an effort to stop Israel’s effort to Judaise the site. She believes that Israel wants to show Muslims, as well as the whole world, that it controls the mosque and is responsible for it. “Israel is trying to prove something that isn’t right. The real owners of the mosque are all the Muslims around the world,” she told the Media Line in March.

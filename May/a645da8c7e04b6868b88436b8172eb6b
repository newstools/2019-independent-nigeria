ABUJA – After governing Oyo State for two terms of eight years, the outgoing governor, Senator Abiola Ajimobi has revealed what he could not do and has been his regret. Ajimobi said he regrets the fact that he has not been able to do everything he wanted to do. The governor said this on Friday when he spoke to State House correspondents after a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. He said that he wished the people of Oyo could be more understanding, could be more patient but they feel that “any time you try to make a change, people resist change even if it’s good for them.” The governor also regretted that he wished he had been in politics 20 years ago. However, the governor who expressed gratitude to God for making him the only governor to have governed the state for two consecutive terms said he has built a legacy that would stand the test of time. Ajimobi also thanked President Buhari for the support he has given all the states particularly during the period of “scarcity of funds to execute projects, to pay salaries, to meet the socioeconomic development demands.”

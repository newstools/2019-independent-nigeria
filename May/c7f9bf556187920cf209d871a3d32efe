Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The 20-year-old is seen as one of the best of the next generation of European stoppers. Veteran Petr Cech is set to hang up his gloves after Wednesday’s Europa League final so the Gunners are looking at Donnarumma as a long term successor. Cech is set to line up against his former side Chelsea at the showpiece in Baku, Azerbaijan. Arsenal boss Unai Emery paid Bayer Leverkusen £22.5m to bring Bernd Leno to the Emirates last summer to compete for the No.1 spot. But according to Italian publication Tutto Mercato Web, he is unconvinced that the German gloveman is good enough at the highest level. And as such, Emery has requested that Arsenal chiefs speak to AC Milan about potentially bringing Donnarumma to the Emirates. But the youngster will likely set the Gunners back most, if not all of their summer transfer war chest. The report claims selling Donnarumma would be an important asset to help Milan comply with Financial Fair Play regulations but will ask for around the same amount that Roma received for Alisson.

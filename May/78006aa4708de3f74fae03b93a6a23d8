LAGOS – Flying Eagles of Nigeria kicked off their 2019 FIFA Under-20 World Cup campaign with a 4-0 defeat of Qatar on Friday. The coach Paul Aigbogun lads lived up to expectations from the blast of the referee’s whistle as Maxwell Effiom scored the first goal in the 12th minute of play while Henry Offia made it two in the 24th minutes for the Nigerians. Manchester City young star, Tom Dele Bashiru scored the third goal in the 68th minutes as Olasunkanmi Aliyu capped the goals for the Nigerians in the 74th minutes. Meanwhile, Coach Aigbogun in spite of the victory, has promised that they would not underrate any team at the ongoing tournament. “We have started well and it is our prayer that the players will continue to live up to expectations. “Winning the first group match is something that is good for the team, but sustaining the tempo is another thing. “We hope to sustain the tempo in our subsequent matches. “We are here to do our best and to make Nigeria proud,” Aigbogun told media. “No team is a small team anymore. We want to do our best and come out top of the group. “We have a few lads in the team that are new because we made a few changes to the team that played the African qualifiers. These players will hopefully add quality to the team.” It would be recalled that the Flying Eagles have never won the Under-20 World Cup, with their best outings being the 1989 and 2005 editions, where they finished as runners-up behind Portugal and Argentina, respectively. The Flying Eagles will now play the United States on Monday, May 27 in their second Group match. In some of the other matches played on Friday, Honduras lost 0-5 to New Zealand while Colombia shocked hosts, Poland 2-0. In another match already decided Japan drew 1-1 with Ecuador.

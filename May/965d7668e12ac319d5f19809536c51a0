LAGOS – Super Eagles of Nigeria chances of a good outing at the forthcoming Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Egypt received a boost on Thursday when Shanghai Greenland Shenhua of China striker, Odion Ighalo, received a recovery date verdict of 01 June. Ighalo, who copped an injury on Friday, May 10 is expected to be fit and ready to return to action on 01 June. His Chinese Super League club reveals that the striker and top scorer in the AFCON qualifiers would be expected back to full fitness 24 hours before the Nigerian camp opens in Asaba, Delta State on 02 June. That should put Ighalo in the right frame for the Super Eagles’ activities in their AFCON 2019 build-up, such that Nigerian soccer fans will now heave a sigh of relief. “This is cheering news for the Super Eagles handlers and the entire team as we want the full fitness of all our players ahead of the AFCON in Egypt. Ighalo is one of the key players in the team,” said the team’s media officer, Toyin Ibitoye. The Super Eagles who are making their 18th appearances at the AFCON finals are drawn in Group B alongside Syli Nationale of Guiena and two debutants, Burundi and Madagascar. The team will start their campaign against Burundi on 22 June in Alexandra, Egypt at 7:00 pm Nigerian time. Four days later, on 26 June, the Super Eagles will play Guineans (who picked silver medal ahead of Nigeria in 1976 AFCON) in their second match at 4:30 pm, while their last group game against Madagascar is on 30 June at 6:00 pm. All group B matches will hold in Alexandra, Egypt.

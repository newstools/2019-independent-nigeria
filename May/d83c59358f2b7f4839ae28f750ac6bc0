LAGOS – The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) said it has recorded breakthrough in the effort to eliminate the practice of open defecation through Community Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) in 11 Local Government Areas in the country. Announcing this was Bioye Ogunjobi, UNICEF WASH specialist, at a Media Dialogue in Kano on Sanitation and Hygiene, UNICEF Communication Specialist, with the theme; “Clean Nigeria: Use the Toilet Campaign.” Ogunjobi said that UNICEF has supported the ministry of water resources to ensure access to hygiene and sanitation in 11 out of 774 LGAs in various states across Nigeria. The 11 LGAs which are now Open Defecation Free (ODF) Ogunjobi said are Daas, Warji in Bauchi state; Birnin Kudu and Buji in Jigawa state; Ikom, Yala, Obanliku, Yakur, Boki and Berkwara in Cross River state and Logo in Benue State. “We were able to achieve this by supporting the federal ministry to implement what we call Community led total sanitation,” the WASH specialist stressed. He explained that the CLT is an approach which helps members of various communities realise the dangers of Open Defecation (OD) and take collective decision to stop the act. The WASH specialist observed that these community members take a collective action to build and use toilets. Ogunjobi further noted that Nigeria needs increased investment from the government for sanitation. According to him, a set of priorities which include taking WASH to disadvantaged communities in the rural areas, improving access to safe water and sanitation in schools and health care facilities as well as hygiene promotion and advocacy remain optimum priority. “They are 11 LGAs in number, but we are likely to have two more in Jigawa within the next one month,” Ogunjobi said. He said; “This has happened in a total number of 11 LGAs in Nigeria, but this is a drop in the ocean. Because we are talking about 774 LGAs and we have been able to address Open Defecation in only 11 LGAs with 764 of them left.

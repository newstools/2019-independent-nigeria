LAGOS – Martin Westphal, the Director of Development at the PGAs of Europe has identified education as one of the key factors in achieving the desired goal in golf development. Westphal speaking during a working visit to the PGA of Nigeria in Lagos over the weekend believes that the managers of the game must be well knowledgeable to be able to impact knowledge to the beginners. “I’m new in Nigeria and I’m here to know how golf is being managed and see how we can work together. However, there is need for Nigeria to combine both the formal and informal education to achieve her target in golf.” “The PGAN have those who know the game, they can become coaches to teach the beginners but most importantly, they must be educated enough to be able to teach the game properly. That is where the formal education is also very important,” he said. He appreciated the verse population of Nigeria adding, “Nigeria has a good population which they can tap from to develop golf. This he said against the backdrop of sport being business which can create employment for the teeming population in the labour market.

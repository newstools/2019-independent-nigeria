Tottenham full-back Serge Aurier has insisted that he is happy at the club and is ready to fight for his place. The Ivorian has had a season disrupted by injury, which meant that he made just 17 appearances in all competitions and just eight in the Premier League throughout the season. The player recovered from a hamstring injury to take a place on the bench for the final Premier League game of the season against Everton, but was an unused substitute for that game. Aurierâ€™s last appearance in a Spurs shirt was the 1-0 victory over Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League last 16 tie back in early March.

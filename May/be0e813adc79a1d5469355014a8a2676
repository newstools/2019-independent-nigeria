Madonna was briefly barred from entering the Eurovision Song Contest venue in Tel Aviv on Thursday (16May19), according to reports in Israel. The 60-year-old is due to perform two or three songs during the final of the event on Saturday (18May), but has delayed signing all the required contracts, blog.wenn.com reports. According to TV news bulletins in the country, reported by The Times of Israel, Eurovision boss Jon Ola Sand initially ordered that the singer be prevented from entering the Expo Tel Aviv venue for rehearsal. However, he later relented after an agreement was reached with European Broadcasting Union officials, who run the competition. The last minute contract dispute apparently relates to complications over the broadcast rights to her 1989 hit Like A Prayer. Sand revealed Madonna’s performance was not finalized at a press conference on Wednesday, saying: “The European Broadcasting Union has never confirmed Madonna as an act. We don’t have a signed contract with her team, and if we do not have a signed contract she cannot perform on our stage.” She was reportedly refused entry to rehearsals on that day as well, but was admitted after threatening to cancel her finals gig. Meanwhile, activists have also called on the star to pull out of Eurovision in protest at the Israeli government’s treatment of Palestinians in the Occupied Territories. The Material Girl singer has defied their calls though, telling Reuters: “I’ll never stop playing music to suit someone’s political agenda nor will I stop speaking out against violations of human rights wherever in the world they may be. My heart breaks every time I hear about the innocent lives that are lost in this region and the violence that is so often perpetuated to suit the political goals of people who benefit from this ancient conflict.”

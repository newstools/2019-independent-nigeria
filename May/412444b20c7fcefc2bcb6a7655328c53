Primal Scream frontman Bobby Gillespie has sparked controversy by calling Madonna “a total prostitute” for agreeing to perform in Israel, standard.co.uk has reported. The 56-year-old singer made the comments in regards to Madonna’s upcoming appearance for Eurovision in Tel Aviv. He said his band would “never” play in Israel as he criticised the pop star for doing so. His comments have seen him accused of anti-Semitism while some branded it misogyny to use the term prostitute as an insult towards a woman. He denied being anti-Semitic and said “all my heroes are Jews” and also said he had “nothing against prostitutes”. Speaking on Newsnight to Kirsty Wark, Gillespie said: “Madonna would do anything for money, you know, she’s a total prostitute. “And I’ve got nothing against prostitutes. The whole thing is set up to normalise the state of Israel, and its disgraceful treatment of the Palestinian people. “By going to perform in Israel what you do is you normalise that. “Primal Scream would never perform in Israel. “I think Madonna is just desperate for publicity, desperate for the money. He added: “They pay very, very well.” Asked if he believed in the right of the state of Israel to exist he said: “No I believe in the rights of the Palestinian people.” The asked “and the rights of the Israelis?” he said: “It’s stolen land.” When asked whether he understood his comments could be construed as anti-Semitic, Gillespie said: “I’m not anti-Semitic at all. All my heroes are Jews. Karl Marx, Bob Dylan, The Marx Brothers.” Following the interview’s broadcast on Friday night, social media has been awash with debate over his interview. A quote from Madonna used by the BBC to follow the interview said: “I’ll never stop playing music to suit someone’s political agenda nor will I stop speaking out against violations of human rights.” Representatives of Madonna have been contacted for further comment.

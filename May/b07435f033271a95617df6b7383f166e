Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) has selected Lagos as host of the season-ending play-off that would produce the league champions. The LMC announced this on Tuesday, explaining that the Super 6 would be staged at the Agege Stadium from June 4 to 12. Chairman of the LMC, Shehu Dikko, revealed this, noting that Katsina State was also in the running to stage the mini-league tournament. “Lagos will host the Super Six, we are also considering TV coverage, but we have picked Katsina State as an alternative venue,” the LMC boss told the media. The Agege Stadium is the home ground for MFM who narrowly missed out on a place in the play-offs and will now be hosting the six teams that would be battling it out in the play-offs. The teams that will be taking part are Rangers International, Akwa United, Kano Pillars, Ifeanyi Ubah, Lobi Stars and Enyimba. The Super Six will also determine the three spots for CAF inter-club football next season.

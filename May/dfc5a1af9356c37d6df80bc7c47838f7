Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Lagos – Super Falcons ambition at the forthcoming FIFA Women’s World Cup in France is reaching the quarter-final. This was the submission of Coach Thomas Dennerby in an interview with Reuters on Wednesday. “Our ambition is to get to the last 16 at least,” Dennerby told Reuters by telephone. “These days, it’s much harder to go to the quarterfinals because the teams are so much stronger, so it’s going to need a really strong performance. “I hope that we can do that and get through to the round of 16, then win one more game. “The team has the capacity to do that. We have really worked hard to be the best Nigerian team ever to go to the World Cup.” Nigeria open their Group A campaign against Norway in Reims on June 6, and Dennerby says the game is key to their hopes of getting to the playoffs. “We know that Norway is a good tournament team; they have a good record. But they are not at the same level as they were in the ’90s, so we must believe we have a chance.” Nigeria also play South Korea and hosts France in Group A. Meanwhile,  Falcons will play Slovakia on Sunday for a friendly– the second time both teams would be meeting this year. On 1st March 2019 at the Cyprus Women’s Cup in March, Falcons edged a seven –goal thriller against the Slovakians, with goals from midfielder Rita Chikwelu (a brace), defender Osinachi Ohale and forward Anam Imo. Sunday’s game comes up five days after the Falcons travelled to Hungary to defeat Hungarian top division team Haladas Viktoria 5-1 in their first friendly since arriving Austria. On return from Hungary, the Falcons will train on Monday, before flying to France on Tuesday ahead of their first match of the FIFA World Cup against Norway in Reims on Saturday, 8th June.

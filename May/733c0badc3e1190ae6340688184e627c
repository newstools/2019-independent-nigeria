The Super Falcons will today play face Black Queens of Ghana in the semifinal match of the ongoing WAFU Women’s Cup in Abidjan, Cote d’Ivoire. The Falcons had defeated the Les Aiglonnes of Mali 2-0 in the last Group B match to top the group, while Mali placed second. In Group A, hosts Cote d’Ivoire played a goalless draw with Ghana to top the group, while Ghana placed second. Rivers Angels striker Rafiat Sule and Southeastern University star Uchenna Kanu were the heroines for the Super Falcons at the Stade Robert Champroux. The match will be a repeat of last year’s edition where the Black Queens beat Super Falcons. “It is going to be a tough match but the players are in good shape for the encounter. We are not out for revenge but we are going to play our normal game with the sole aim of winning and playing in the final”, said Falcons assistant coach, Maureen Mmadu. On the other hand, Group B runners-up Mali will take on the hosts Cote d’Ivoire in the first semifinal, also in a repeat of last year semifinal showdown on the same day at Parc de Sport.

LAGOS – It was a dramatic end to the regular season of the Nigeria Professional Football League 2018/2019 season as the trio of Lobi Stars, Enyimba and FC IfeanyiUbah joined Rangers, Akwa United and Kano Pillars in the season-end playoff. In the week 22 round of matches decided on Sunday, Lobi Stars drew goalless with already relegated Remo Stars and that took their points haul to 35 and cemented their second spot in Group A. Enyimba lost 1-2 to Katsina United but finished third on 33 points, thus making it to the playoff. Their qualification despite the loss was because fourth-placed MFM lost 4-2 to Sunshine Stars in Akure, leaving them on only 32 points. In Group B, FC IfeanyiUbah joined already qualified Akwa United and Kano Pillars in the playoff after defeating the Promise Keepers 2-1 in Nnewi. The Anambra Warrior qualified despite a fierce battle from fourth-placed Nasarawa United. For relegation, Bendel Insurance, Niger Tornadoes and Kwara United joined Remo Stars in the Nigeria National League (NNL) next season in Group A, while El-Kanemi Warriors is the biggest casualty in Group B, joining Yobe Stars, Gombe United and Go Round in the lower league next season.

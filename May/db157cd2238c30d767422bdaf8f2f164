Kenyan trio of Alex Korio, Simon Cheprot and Polline Wanjiku will lead over 35 elite athletes to Nigeria today ahead of Saturday’s IAAF silver label Okpekpe international 10km road race which holds in Okpekpe, in Etsako East local government area of Edo state. The trio will be coming in with their focus on making history as the first man and woman to win two Okpekpe titles since the inaugural edition of the race in 2013. “The athletes, together with their Nigerian counterparts will go on tour of the course on Friday in line with IAAF requirements,” says Mercy Etukudo, the race’s head of secretariat, who added that the athletes will get their registration done as soon as they arrive in Auchi. However, final registration of all categories of athletes for the race will begin today. This means that all registered athletes will be screened and accredited for the race which begins early Saturday morning. They will be provided with their bib numbers as a sign of accreditation for the race. The race, which is powered by Pamodzi Sports Marketing, leaders in sports marketing and hospitality business in Nigeria, will be live on Supersports and Africa Independent Television.

Airlines should add a levy of “less than 50p” per ticket to pay for the repatriation of passengers when carriers go bust, according to a government-commissioned review. In a report through sky news, the review was commissioned following the collapse of Monarch in 2017 which saw the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) rescue 85,000 passengers at a cost to taxpayers of £40.5m. But airlines have rejected the proposal, with the owner of British Airways saying customers “should not be charged a levy to bail out other carriers”. Peter Bucks, who chaired the Airline Insolvency Review, said: “We know passengers expect to be protected from being stranded overseas if their airline should collapse, but in practice, each year many people fly without such protection. “Although airline insolvencies are relatively rare, as we have seen in recent months they do happen – and at times have required government to step in to repatriate passengers at great cost to the taxpayer.” When an airline goes bust, some passengers left stranded abroad are protected under the ATOL scheme covering package holidays – but that does not cover flights booked directly with airlines. Those who are not protected have to make their own arrangements and seek refunds from credit or debit card firms or through travel insurance policies.

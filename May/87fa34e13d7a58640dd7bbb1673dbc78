Ajax certainly have a history of losing talented players to FC Barcelona, dating back to the ’70s. Johan Cruyff, Johan Neeskens, the De Boer brothers, Jari Litmanen, as well as managers Rinus Michael and Louis van Gaal, have left Ajax for Barca. Many more, like Ronald Koeman and Patrick Kluivert have ended up at Camp Nou from Ajax via elsewhere. And the latest to join that list is Frenkie de Jong. The youngster has already agreed a deal to move to Barcelona after four years at Ajax. The deal will cost Barca €75m, making it a record sale for the Eredivisie.

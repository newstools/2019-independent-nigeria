During talks held in Moscow, Vladimir Putin and President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Denis Sassou Nguesso agreed that Russian military will be sent to Congo, according to the contract published on the Kremlin’s website. RIA Novosti, citing Deputy Minister of Defense Alexander Fomin, reported that the two sides are also negotiating arms transfers. “We expect that we will be requested to supply new equipment. There is a need for it,” the official explained. The parties signed several more agreements, in particular, a letter of intent between the Russian oil giant LUKOIL and the Congo State Oil Company. Democratic Republic of the Congo is among the African countries where, according to Bloomberg, co-owner of the Concord group of companies and the close associate of Putin Yevgeny Prigozhin has business interests. The agency reported that Prigozhin seeks to expand his influence in the republic.

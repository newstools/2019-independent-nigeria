The mutilated remains of a woman were found in an abandoned building in a shopping complex in the East Java city of Malang yesterday, along with several notes that may point to it having been a brutal revenge killing. At around 1:30pm yesterday, merchants at a nearby market smelled something foul coming from the second floor of the complex. “The stench was overpowering. When I checked, it turned out there were mutilated body parts. Under the stairs I saw a leg and an arm that were chopped off,” one of the merchants, Trisno Harianto, told JawaPos yesterday. Police soon searched the building and found that the body was mutilated into six parts. The victim’s torso, which was only covered by her underwear, was decomposing in a bathroom while her head and limbs were found spread out around the building. Police also found several cryptic notes, written in red ink, on a piece of paper as well as on the walls. The notes appeared to be gibberish and nonsensical at first, but, upon closer inspection, police say they contained messages such as, “Complicated people in the end will get their curse from God.” The mutilated remains are, for the moment, thought to belong to a girl from Malang regency who went missing two weeks ago. Two of her family members went to identify the body yesterday evening, but there have been no reports yet on whether they confirmed the identity of the victim. “We are still carrying out an autopsy on the victim. We are also questioning three witnesses,” Malang City Police Chief Asfuri said.

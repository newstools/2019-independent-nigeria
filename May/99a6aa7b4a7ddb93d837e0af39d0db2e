Lagos – It was a heartbreak for Super Falcons’ Asisat Oshoala and her Barcelona Ladies as they were beaten 4-1 by Lyon of France Ladies in the UEFA Champions League final decided on Saturday at Groupama Arena, Budapest, Hungary. The defending champions, Lyon, started the scoring as early as the fifth minute as Germany’s Dzsenifer Marozsan turned in The Netherlands’ Shanice Van de Sanden for the opening goal. Nine minutes later, it was two goals for Lyon after Ada Hegerberg scored, capitalizing on the pace of Shanice. Hegerberg made it three goals for the champions and she completed her hat-trick 10 minutes with an assist from England right back, Lucy Bronze, making Lyon to score three goals in 17 minutes. However, in the 89th minute, Barcelona Ladies had a consolation as Oshoala netted. The Netherlands’ Lieke Martens plays in a cracking through ball for Nigeria’s Oshoala and the former Liverpool and Arsenal star picks her spot for the goal.

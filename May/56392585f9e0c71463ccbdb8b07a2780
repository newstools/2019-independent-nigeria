Lagos – Paul Aigbogun, Flying Eagles coach, has promised to correct the loopholes noticed in the team ahead this year’s FIFA U-20 World Cup in Poland. Reviewing the team’s 1-2 loss to Saudi Arabia in their latest build-up match ahead of the World Cup; Aigbogun blamed the defeat on ill luck. “We were unlucky to have lost against the Saudis. We created a lot of chances but failed to convert them to goals. “Our focus will shift to conversion of opportunities because we want to make an impact at the FIFA World Cup. “There are a few other areas myself and my assistants noticed. We will work hard at these when we get back to our training camp in Germany”, he said. Aigbogun pointed out that the winning side were also heading for the Youth Mundial in Poland, ahead of which he said his players will correct all errors they committed in Sunday’s defeat. He affirmed that his boys learnt some vital lessons in the defeat during the friendly they played in Vienna, Austria. Flying Eagles will have further test games against German clubs TSG Hoffenheim and Red Bull Leipzig, as well as Austria’s Red Bull Salzburg, before heading to the Polish city of Tychy where they play Qatar in their opening match of the Youth Mundial on May 24. Nigeria will also face Ukraine and United States in Group D of the World Cup, ahead of which the seven time African champions, two time FIFA World Cup runners-up and one-time bronze medalists headed back to their preparations base in Bad Goegging Munich, Germany.

Eden Hazard ‘is on the verge of agreeing personal terms with Real Madrid’ as the Chelsea star closes in on his wish to move to the Bernabeu. The breakthrough follows lengthy negotiations between the club and Hazard’s representatives which haven’t always been smooth. But, according to The Independent, the two parties are close to agreement as the summer window approaches and the deal looks likely to go through. The Belgian has rebuffed attempts by Chelsea, where he has just 12 months remaining on his contract, to make him the highest-paid player in Premier League history. Having been handed a two-window transfer ban by FIFA, Chelsea are exceedingly reluctant to sell Hazard but are likely to receive £100million for a player Real coach Zinedine Zidane is known to admire greatly. Zidane has been promised a large transfer kitty to revamp Real’s squad following a season of disappointment both domestically and in the Champions League. Chelsea already have a contingency plan in place for Hazard’s departure with the American Christian Pulisic arriving from Borussia Dortmund this summer for £58m. With Chelsea away to Leicester City in their final Premier League fixture this Sunday, Hazard may have played at Stamford Bridge for the last time against Eintracht Frankfurt on Thursday night. But Hazard was coy on his future prospects following Chelsea’s passage to the Europa League final. ‘I don’t think about that. I’m only thinking about winning something for this club and this squad,’ Hazard said. ‘If it’s my last game I will try to do everything for this club to win a trophy. In my mind, I don’t know yet.’

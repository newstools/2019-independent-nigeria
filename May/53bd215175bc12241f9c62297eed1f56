The Delta State Government has waded into the ongoing face-off between the Polobubo (Tsekelewu) community in Warri North Local Government Area of the state and the Chevron Nigeria Limited as it has met with some leaders, elders of the community and representatives of the Chevron on Tuesday at the Government House Annex, Warri. It would be recalled that fire had broken out on an oil-well belonging to Chevron in the area since April 18, thereby resulting to disagreement between the leadership of Polobubo and the company over the identity and location of the facility on fire. While the community identified it as Ikpalapkala-Bou oil-well, located in the Ijaw community in Delta, Chevron on the other hand said the facility was Ojumale oil-well, located in Ondo state. The community was represented by the Polobubo (Tsekelewu) National Council (PNC) including National President, Mr. Ebilate Mac-Yoroki; the General Secretary, Mr Midwest Kukuru. Others were: former President of the council, Mr. Edmund Tiemo and Mr. Dickson Asoki, among others. Chevronâ€™s management was also represented by Mr Tony Emegere and Mr Happy Appai from the Policy Government and Public Affairs (PGPA) Department of the oil multinational. Members of the community said they would resist alleged plan by Chevron to cede parts of their land to their Ilaje neighbours in Ondo state. Mac-Yoroki, who presented the position of the community at the meeting, expressed displeasure over the attitude and operations of Chevron in recent time. He called on the state government to prevail on the company to address the misdeed it had caused the community since its operation in their land.

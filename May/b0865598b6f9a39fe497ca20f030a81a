Children are dying in the camp for captured families from the Islamic State caliphate because they are shunned by aid groups and kept under tight security restrictions, a medical charity says. “We feel that people are unnecessarily dying, children are dying of preventable illness [and] that is unacceptable,” MSF’s Syria emergency manager Will Turner said. Approximately 11,000 foreigners — 7,000 of them children — who surrendered during the final battles against Islamic State are kept in a heavily-guarded section of the al-Hawl camp known as the ‘third country annexe’. MSF said this limits their access to healthcare and the basic services provided to the more than 60,000 people in the rest of the camp. “The level of assistance in that part of the camp is minimal. We’ve so far only been granted access to have a mobile clinic and we’re currently the only health actor in there,” Mr Turner said.

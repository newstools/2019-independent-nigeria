NNEWI – Members of the Ralph Uwazuruike-led Biafra Independent Movement (BIM–MASSOB) have laid a foundation stone in Awka, Anambra State, to erect a multi-million naira secretariat to immortalise the late Emeka Odimegwu Ojukwu, the man who led the defunct Biafra nation during the Nigeria civil war. The organization slated Wednesday, May 22 as their anniversary day to celebrate Biafra day otherwise known as Igbo day. While laying the secretariat’s foundation stone in Awka, last Monday, Arinze Igbani BIM- MASSOB and Biafra council elder in charge of Awka South, noted that the secretariat when completed, would be a rallying point for the promotion of Igbo course and liberation. He said that it would be a centre to propagate efforts of the late Ojukwu to liberate the Igbos as an independent nation, stressing that the association, under Ralph Uwazuruike, will not relent until the Igbos are totally liberated from the Nigerian nation.

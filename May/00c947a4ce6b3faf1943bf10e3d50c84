The defeat came on Monday through a judgment of the Federal High Court sitting in Uyo, delivered by Justice Fatun Riman, which brought to an end the case involving the sacked lawmakers. It would be recalled that the Akwa Ibom State House of Assembly last year declared vacant the seats of lawmakers representing Essien Udim, Mkpat Enin, Itu, Ikono and Etim Ekpo/Ika following the lawmaker’s defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC). As a result, the five lawmakers, not sued the House and Speaker to court, but, converted that Akwa Ibom State House of Assembly to a war zone, invaded the plenary, and declared every other member suspended and elected one of them, former member representing Essien Udim, Nse Ntuen, as Speaker. Reacting to the judgment, the PDP in a press conference in Uyo on Monday applauded the court for causing justice to be done against those who wanted to plunge the state into anarchy. The party which spoke through its Publicity Secretary, Comrade Ini Ememobong, also commended the Speaker, Barr Onofiok Luke, for maintaining calm and peaceful disposition during the crisis, maintaining that the former lawmakers’ seats were declared vacant by reason of their defection from the PDP without lawful justification.

Powered by RubiQube Ad Network John Cleese has been criticised after reiterating his belief that London is not “an English city anymore”. The British actor, 79, tweeted a message reminding his 5.6m followers that he expressed the same belief in 2011 this time adding that his friends abroad now agree with him. “There must be some truth in it,” he wrote, adding: ”I note also that London was the UK city that voted most strongly to remain in the EU.” His comments have attracted ire from many Twitter users, including comedian Dom Joly, who were quick to point out the irony of his comments considering he lives in the Caribbean. “He’s clearly a really smart funny man but it is basically a very racist tweet,” Joly wrote. “Secondly, its a racist tweet by a man who lives on a Caribbean island – the irony of that is insane.” There are too many immigrants in London from my home where I live in the Caribbean.” Cleese, who said he was going to vote for Brexit ahead of the EU referendum in 2017, announced plans to move to the Caribbean last year expressing a disappointment with Britain. The actor, who co-founded iconic comedy troupe Monty Python before going on to co-write and star in the sitcom Fawlty Towers, argued the standard of debate around Brexit was “awful”. Cleese, who turned down a life peerage for political services in 1999, has been an outspoken supporter of electoral and press reform. Talking about his new home on Newsnight in 2018, he said: “It’s one of the nicest islands I’ve ever been on. The relationship between the races is absolutely superb. The people there are really kind.”

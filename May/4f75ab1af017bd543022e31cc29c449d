Iran’s parliament on Sunday passed a bill that would allow children born to an Iranian mother to apply for citizenship. The bill was backed by 188 lawmakers, while 20 voted against it. Addressing the parliamentary session, MP Mahmoud Rahimi Jihan Abadi hailed the move to give citizenship to children born to Iranian mothers. “By what logic can citizenship be denied between a mother and her child?,” he questioned. But MP Farhad Tajri, who opposes the move, argued that the bill would be an “opportunity for people who pose a threat to the security of the country.” Currently, children in Iran acquire nationality of the country through their fathers, but not their mothers. The bill still needs to be approved by Iran’s Guardian Council before being signed into law.

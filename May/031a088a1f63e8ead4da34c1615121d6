Interior Minister Matteo Salvini let a charity boat carrying 30 rescued migrants dock at an Italian port on Friday, but said the vessel would be impounded and not let out to sea again. The migrants, including two pregnant women, a baby and four unaccompanied minors, were picked up by the Mare Jonio on Thursday some 40 miles (64 km) off the coast of Libya as their rubber boat was sinking. The Italian government has repeatedly accused charity rescuers of being complicit with people smugglers, who charge large sums to help migrants get to Europe, and Salvini has closed the countryâ€™s ports to their boats. NGOs deny the accusation, but most of them have stopped sailing in the central Mediterranean given the uncompromising position of the Italian government and repeated investigations by magistrates. However, the Mare Jonio, which is operated by the Italian charity Mediterranean, has so far defied the pressure and it was briefly impounded in March in Lampedusa after bringing dozens of migrants ashore. Salvini said on Thursday it would not be allowed to dock with the latest rescued group, but he changed tack on Friday, apparently after being told that the vessel would be seized.

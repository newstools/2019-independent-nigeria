With increased supplies from the North, prices of onions which started declining gradually in January this year, owing to the onset of its season of harvest, have persistently remained on a sliding trend, falling further in the week under review. The commodity is highly sought after by consumers because of its nutritional value and as such it is always being patronised regardless of the price which is not usually favourable during the season of scarcity. Besides, the usefulness of the commodity cannot be over-emphasised as most consumers cannot do without it especially in cooking all kinds of delicacies. The reduction in the prices of the commodity has enabled some of the traders to increase stock as well as sustaining their normal purchases. The situation also saw some of them who once abandoned the trade for a cheaper one, when the prices hit the roofs, resuming back to business. During the week, visits to various markets across the states indicated that prices of onions have reduced sharply by over 50 percent between January and May 16, 2019, a situation which many of the traders attributed to on-season effect and bumper harvest. Checks at the Ogbeogolog Market, Asaba, revealed that prices of the commodity witnessed a downward trend from what was sold before. For instance, a 100kg bag of onions that went for as high as N35,000 last year December  at the Ogbeogologo Market, Asaba, dropped to N20,000 in March, before decreasing further to between N10,000 and N11,500 within the review week. Mr. Okala Ibe, who sells the commodity in wholesale price at the Ogbeogologo Market Asaba, in a chat with our correspondent linked the decline to availability and improved supply usually associated with the season of harvest. The same could be mentioned for that of Ose Market, Onitsha, as a prices of a 100kg bag of onions that previously attracted between N18,000 and N20,000 also fell, currently ranging from N9,000 to N10,000, of which many of the traders connected to  seasonal factors coupled with increased supplies from the North. However, Mrs. Theresa Egwu, who retails the produce at the Ose Market, Onitsha, said the sharp reduction in the prices of the produce had not really boosted sales, linking the situation to lack of purchasing power. That of Nkwo Market Nnewi also decreased, currently selling for between N12,000 and N13,000  down from N25,000 initially sold. Mallam Yisau Ibrahim, who trades in the commodity at Nkwo Market, Nnewi, said the decline in the prices of the commodity was not a surprise to him because of its season of abundance. At the Itam Market, Uyo, prices of the commodity were also at a plunging trend, as a 100kg bag currently goes for between N12,500 and N13,000 down from N18,000 previously sold. Many of the traders connected the situation to adequate supply from its major sources, resulting to availability. But Mr. Saleh Abdul, another trader at the Itam Market, Uyo, said that despite  the reduction, prices of onions are still expensive, being in its season of plenty, blaming  it on high cost of transportation . He was, however, very optimistic that prices of the commodity would crash further. Checks at the Oba Market, Benin City, Edo State, revealed that prices of a 100kg bag of onions that previously went for between N18,000 and N18,500 fell sharply to N10,000, a situation which many of the traders ascribed to on-season effect. For Lafenwa Market, Ogun State, the trend was not dissimilar from that of other region, especially with the prices of a 100kg bag of onions currently selling for between N9,000 to N10,000 against N17,000 earlier sold. Mrs. Busari Fathia who sells the commodity at the Lafenwa Market, in a chat with SUNDAY INDEPENDENT linked the decrease to improved supply from the North. In Dawanau Market, Kano, prices of a 100kg bag of onions reduced further between N6,000 and N7,000  from N10,000 previously sold. Likewise, that of Gombe Main Market, Gombe, falling within the region of N7,000 and N8,000 from N12,000 previously attracted. Many of the traders at the Dawanau Market, Kano, attributed the decline in prices of the commodity to availability arising from the season of abundance. At the Bodija Market, Ibadan, prices of the commodity witnessed a downward trend of over 50 percent, falling within the region of N7,000 and N8,000 from N15,000 initially sold. Mr. Nuraini Ishaq, who trades in the commodity in large quantities at the Bodija Market, Ibadan, connected the situation to increased supply, availability and low demand. In Lagos, checks at popular markets such as Mile 12, Iddo and Oyingbo, showed that prices of onions declined, especially with the heavy presence of trucks offloading the commodity at the Mile 12 Market, Lagos, is an indication that the commodity is in its season of harvest. Also, the manner at which traders conspicuously displayed the commodity at a reduced price, beckoning on consumers for patronage could only occur in its season of plenty. Prices of a 100kg bag of onions at the Mile 12 Market, Lagos dropped considerably to between N6,000 and N10,000 as against N15,000 previously sold. This, however, depends on the size of the bag, species and the haggling power of the buyer. Mrs. Eunice Egbuna, who trades in the produce at the Mile 12 Market, Lagos, in a chat with our correspondent, opined that prices of the commodity differ, depending on the type. She said the dried species are more expensive than the moist ones. She, however, principally linked the decline to increased supplies and availability usually experienced in the season of plenty.

Celtic could receive around £3million in windfall if former striker Moussa Dembele completes a move to Manchester United, according to the Daily Star. The newspaper claims that Red Devils boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is keen on the 22-year-old, who left the Hoops for Ligue 1 side Lyon on deadline day last summer. The Daily Star then claims in the same report that, due to a sell-on clause in his contract with the French club, Celtic will receive around £3million if the move – which would reportedly cost £40million for United – does indeed happen. OPINION This would be a great boost for Celtic if the move did happen. The newspaper’s report says that Solskjaer wants young players who can breathe life back into his stagnant United team, and Dembele would certainly tick most – if not all – of the boxes. The French Under-21 international is only 22, and proved in his time with the Hoops that he has an eye for goal, scoring 51 goals in 94 appearances while at Parkhead, which is a fantastic record. Moving onto how it could affect Celtic, £3million is a decent amount of money for Celtic and an amount they could do a lot with. If it did arrive, it would be money they wouldn’t have to make from, for example the sale of another player, which is even better. And one thing that needs to happen at Parkhead this summer is a squad overhaul. Overall, this would be a great move for Celtic if it happened.

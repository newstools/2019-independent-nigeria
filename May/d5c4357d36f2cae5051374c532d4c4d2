LAGOS – After losing to Ukraine in their first group match at the ongoing FIFA U20 Word Cup in Poland, the coach of the United States of America (USA), Tab Ramos, has vowed to beat Nigeria today if his wards would continue in their quest for glory at the event. The two countries go head-to-head today and a win for Nigeria will seal their place in the next round of the competition while a loss for the United States will end their dream in the European nation. Speaking in a press conference on Sunday, Ramos, a member of the American squad to the 1994 World Cup on home soil, noted that they want to bring their campaign back on track with a decent result against the Flying Eagles later today. ”We prepared in the Ukraine game to get three points, now we go to the Nigeria game to get three points,” Ramos told reporters at a press conference after their loss to Ukraine. ”Nigeria’s result, our own result at this point don’t really matter, we are going to do the same thing. ”I think when you go to the third game that’s when you start playing the mathematical games, at this point we just need three points.”

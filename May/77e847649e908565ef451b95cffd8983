Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido wants “direct” cooperation with the U.S. military in his bid to remove President Nicolas Maduro from power. At a rally Saturday in Caracas, Venezuela’s National Assembly president said he will send his envoy in Washington, D.C., Carlos Vecchio, to meet with Southern Command officials. The Florida-based command oversees U.S. military activity in Latin America and the Caribbean, Guido told the supporters he wants “to be able to establish a direct and far-reaching relationship in terms of cooperation.” Adm. Craig Faller, the head of Southern Command, posted on Twittter he is willing to meet with officials with the “legitimate” government of Venezuela.

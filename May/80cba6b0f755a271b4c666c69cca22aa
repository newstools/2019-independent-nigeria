Figures obtained from the apex bank indicated that authorised dealers in the wholesale segment of the market were offered the sum of $100 million, while the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) segment received the sum of $55 million. The sum of $50 million was allocated to customers requiring foreign exchange for invisibles such as tuition fees, medical payments and Basic Travel Allowance (BTA), among others. Mr. Isaac Okorafor, the Director, Corporate Communications Department at the CBN, disclosing this in Abuja, said that the bank’s effort had helped to guarantee stability in all the exchange rate windows. He further noted that the dogged implementation of the country’s foreign exchange restriction to some 43 items had boosted activities in the industrial sector. He also noted that the move had equally increased the level of confidence investors and the public had in the Naira. It would be recalled that at the last intervention, the bank injected the sum of $268.6 million and CNY29.2 million into the Retail Secondary Market Intervention Sales (SMIS) segment.

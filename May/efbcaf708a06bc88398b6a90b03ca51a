Minimie Chinchin and Minimie Noodles in collaboration with the Lagos State Ministry of Women Affairs and Poverty Alleviation, Oyo State Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development are currently working together towards empowering Nigerians by providing them with trade assets to start up new businesses. Minimie actively entered the Nigerian marketing landscape in 2015 with its unique snack and noodle offering and has since been making significant marks in the snack category across the nation. Mr. Rani Kolati, the Brand Manager, Minimie said in a statement that the initiative was borne out of the realisation that lots of Nigerian youth who were unemployed still had the zeal to become entrepreneurs. However, due to financial constraints they could not start on their own. Kolati said that in view of this, the company decided to encourage youth, who he described as the future of the nation with a business to start up. He said the company bootstrap them with a sales kiosk, stock, startup fund and support them with supplies, so they could continue the business and support their family. “We set up these sales kiosks in secure strategic locations for these budding and aspiring entrepreneurs at densely populated bus stops/parks to enhance sales. After the official handover to them, we ensure to deploy our area marketing managers to assist with sales trainings and regular checks to help achieve significant amount of profits which will keep them in business for a long time” Rani stated. Currently there are 15 kiosks scattered across Lagos, four in Ibadan, one in Abeokuta, two in Illorin, three in Onitsha, one in Port Harcourt and six in Benin and many others in the pipeline.

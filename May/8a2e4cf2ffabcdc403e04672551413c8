Nigerians, irrespective of tribe, religious or political leanings, have been charged to be very obedient and intimate with God in their service, as well as show transparent love to one another. Ifeoluwa Oyedele, Executive Director, Niger Delta Power Holdings Company Limited, Abuja, made the remark as the special guest of honour at the just-concluded 2019 annual 57th Synod of the Diocese of Lagos Methodist Church of Nigeria, held at the Wesley Cathedral, Olowogbowo, Lagos at the weekend. He noted that for God to solve challenges facing the nation Nigerians needed total obedience when and where necessary and also to receive awesome turnaround for the society and the country, coupled with a perfect peace of the mind at all times. Oyedele noted that through obedience to God, Nigerians are also assured of the ultimate manifestation of His promises to heal the land, the country from the current unfortunate insecurity and socio-economic doldrums confronting her. Regretting the unfortunate challenges confronting the society and the nation, which had also reflected on the global terrain, the elder statesman reiterated the need for all to have a very complete global sober reflection and to dutifully seek the face of the Lord with very honest sacrifice.

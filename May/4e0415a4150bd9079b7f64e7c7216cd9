UYO – Dr. Chris Ekpenyong, former Deputy Governor of Akwa Ibom State, who won the Senatorial election to represent the Ikot Ekpene Senatorial District (Akwa Ibom North- West) in the February 23, 2019 elections, has prayed the tribunal to nullify former Governor Godswill Akpabio’s petition seeking to upturn the outcome of the exercise. It was at the resumption of pre-hearing in a suit brought before it by incumbent Senator Godswill Akpabio of the All Progressives Congress (APC) challenging the declaration of Ekpenyong of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the Ikot Ekpene Senatorial election at the weekend. Chief Kanu Agabi (SAN), former Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, stood in for the first respondent (Ekpenyong) and PDP with Mr. Solomon Umohh (SAN), while Mr. Sunday Ameh (SAN), argued the matter for the first petitioner (Akpabio). Agabi and Umoh, had submitted that the petitioners’ prayer for the election of Ekpenyong to be nullified was based on inconsistent grounds and reliefs sought in Akpabio’s petition, noting that the grounds and reliefs sought in the matter were “so incongruous and inconsistent” which render the petition incompetent to stand as a legitimate document in case.

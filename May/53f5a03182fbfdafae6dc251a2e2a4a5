The judge, like she did at the last adjourned date on April 15, renewed a warrant for Okocha’s arrest following reports from the counsel representing Lagos State Government that he was yet to liquidate his alleged tax debt owed the Lagos State. The government’s lawyer, Mrs. Y. A. Pitan, told Justice Akintoye that Okocha had visited the Lagos Internal Revenue Service (LIRS) office but failed to settle the 2017 income tax evasion charge out of court. The warrant was originally made on January, 2019. Like in previous proceedings, Okocha was neither in court nor represented by a lawyer when the case was called. Pitan informed the court of steps the prosecution had taken to effect the arrest warrant. “The LIRS informed us that the defendant (Okocha) visited their office. He went there to reconcile accounts. He hasn’t settled yet,” she said.

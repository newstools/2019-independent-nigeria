Chelsea’s goalkeeping situation is certainly in a better place now than twelve months ago, but we still have some concerns to attend to. Kepa Arrizabalaga has made good on his world record transfer fee and is firmly entrenched as the first-choice at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea’s decision to play him as much as humanly possible while surrounding him with veteran guidance has, except for one high profile cup final incident, paid off nicely. But neither Rob Green nor Willy Caballero are under contract for next season (yet?) and now the latter is being chased by West Ham, according to Evening Standard. West Ham are in need of a backup to Łukasz Fabiański, as current second-choice goalkeeper, Adrian, is set to leave for free in the summer. Caballero would certainly be a good and convenient option, especially as he has previously worked with West Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini at Manchester City.
The 37-year-old Caballero has been a quality backup to both Courtois and Arrizabalaga over the last two seasons, and while he does take up a non-homegrown squad slot, we should try to keep him around as long as possible. It was right around this time last year that Chelsea confirmed that his contract had been extended, so perhaps we’ll hear something similar soon now, too. But if Big Willy is indeed interested in moving to another team, one where perhaps he’ll have a chance for more playing time, we can only wish him the best of luck (except against Chelsea).

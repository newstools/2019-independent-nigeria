Lagos – Solomon Dalung, Minister of Youth and Sports has predicted a successful outing for Nigerian wrestlers at the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo. Dalung said this during a reception on Tuesday April 30, 2019 in Abuja for the wrestlers who emerged African Champions at the recently held Africa Championships in Hammamet, Tunisia and Nigerian Rowers who also won laurels at the Open International Canoe Sprint Championship held in Bhopal, India. On the occasion, Dalung noted that wrestling has become one of Nigeria’s strongest sports at continental and global levels, while inspiration for greatness was also germinating in the little known Nigeria Rowing, Canoe and Rowing Federation. “Nigerian wrestlers have distinguished themselves as a force to reckon with, thus giving the sport an enviable place of pride and elevating the country’s image as a top wrestling nation. “The Nigerian wrestling team placed first in Africa on the overall medals table during the 2015 Africa Games held in Congo Brazzaville. “Similarly, Nigeria dominated other African countries, particularly in women’s wrestling, where they emerged African Champions at the 2018 Africa Championships which Nigeria hosted for the first time. “When our female wrestlers participated in the two-ranking series events in Germany and Bulgaria in February and March 2019, their performances created an avenue for our star athlete, Adekuoroye Odunayo to be ranked 4th in the world and 1st in Africa. “This success, apart from writing a chapter in the annals of the Nigeria Wrestling Federation (NWF) history, is an indicator of the possibility of an Olympic Medal in Tokyo”, he said. He also commended the President of the NWF Hon. Daniel Igali and the President of Rowing, Canoeing and Sailing, Rear Admiral Festus Pobeni  rtd) for providing visionary and motivational leadership to their  federations and congratulated the athletes for their sacrifice and resilience.

LAGOS – Maureen Mmadu, Super Falcons’ assistant coach, received a birthday gift from the team on Thursday as her players thrashed their counterparts from Burkina Faso 5-1 in their opening Group B match at this year’s edition of the West African Football Union (WAFU) Women’s Cup of Nations in Abidjan, Cote d’Ivoire. Mmadu who celebrated her 44th birthday on Tuesday, said the team said the team will do better than they did in last year’s edition, when they could only end up in third place. She declared that the squad is fully determined to do well as it will serve as morale booster for the team ahead of the FIFA Women’s World Cup billed for France later in the year. “I have charged the team to play well and win the WAFU Cup Trophy for me as my birthday gift and they have started very well. They promised to win and present the trophy to me as my birthday gift which the Chief Coach fully supported. “I am sure they have learnt a lot of lessons from the last edition of the competition, when we could only finish third. This time, it will be different. “We are also using this competition as part of our preparations for the World Cup, and many of these players will use this to claim spots there”, she said. Mmadu stressed that the technical crew has already fashioned out strategies on how the players will get a string of good results all the way to the final and return home with the trophy. Earlier, defending champions, the Black Queens of Ghana defeated their counterparts from Senegal 2-0.

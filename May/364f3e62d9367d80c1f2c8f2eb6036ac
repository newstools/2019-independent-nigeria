The suspect who was apprehended by the Oviorie vigilante group confessed to the crime, saying he was actually going after the mother who was with the baby on her shoulder when the assailant struck but the innocent baby fell victim instead of the mother. When asked the offence of the baby’s mother the suspect Ekokodje said the baby’s mother was fond of reminding him of the death of his four children which consequently made him to lose temper. The virtually unperturbed suspect said he does not have any regret, rather he should be kill as well. The father of the baby, Mr. Saturday Okevwe, who was speechless at the terrifying sight of the new born baby boy said he wished justice will be done as the Nigeria Police, Isiokolo Division, took the suspect away for further interrogation.

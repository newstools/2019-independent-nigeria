The United Nations Global Compact has launched a global search for the 2019 class of SDG Pioneers — business leaders who are doing an exceptional job to advance the Sustainable Development Goals. This year’s search for SDG Pioneers will focus exclusively on young professionals under aged 35 and promoting the Global Goals in their companies through the implementation of the UN Global Compact’s Ten Principles on human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. “Four years on, it is clear that progress on the Sustainable Development Goals is much slower than it should be,” said Lise Kingo, CEO & Executive Director of the UN Global Compact. “By recognizing and encouraging young business leaders who are driving transformative solutions in their respective sectors, we have the opportunity to drive truly systemic change and shift the world onto a more sustainable path.”

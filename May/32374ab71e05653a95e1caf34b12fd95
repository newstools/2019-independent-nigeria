In an interview to Tennis Magazin, Alexander Zverev commented on the future of tennis. “Shapovalov and Auger-Aliassime will be Grand Slam winners. Both of them. I’ve been saying that about Denis for two years already, and I’m sure that Felix will also be a Major winner. They are not only good; they are very good. They will be very dangerous. Both of them play aggressively. Both of them actually learnt the game well: they know what to do and when to do it, they know when to come forward, when to slice, when to hit a different shot. I’m impressed by them. It’s going to become a great rivalry because I think that I’ll also be a Grand Slam winner. I don’t want to sound arrogant but it’s important to have confidence in yourself. I believe I can do it.” On his win over Mischa in Acapulco, Zverev added: “It’s an amazing feeling. In Acapulco, we beat very good teams, especially the Bryan brothers, which is always very special. Sharing such emotion with someone of your family, your big brother, is incredible.” Asked if they plan to compete in 2020 Tokyo together, the 20-year-old replied: “Oh yes! If his ranking is high enough to play, I’ll make sure it happens (smiles). Competing in the Olympics with your big brother is unbelievable. I’ll make sure that the German Federation knows that we are interested!”

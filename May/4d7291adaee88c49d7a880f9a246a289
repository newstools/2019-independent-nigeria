Others include cases of contraception and safe abortion where it stated that approximately 142,000 women were being treated each year for complications from unsafe abortion. Abortion is legally permitted only to save a woman’s life in Nigeria, which means that many induced abortions are clandestine and unsafe. Against this backdrop, a non-governmental organisation (NGO), IPad, organised a two-day media training for journalists on the Violence Against Persons Prohibition Act, danger of domestic rape, sexual harassment, abortion, among others, prevention and control. Hauwa Shekarau, Ipas Country Director, said the objective of the training was to sensitise media practioners on the provision of the Act, adding that although it was only in force in Abuja, but the project aimed to domesticate it in Jigawa State. She stressed that the media being major stakeholders in the project, the Women Integrated Services for Health (WISH) Project, Ipas through its activity, was sentisising the media to enable them join in the crusade of public advocacy for the domestication of the VAPP Act in Jigawa State.

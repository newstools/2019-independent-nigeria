LAGOS – Kenneth Omeruo, Leganes of Spain defender, has downplayed worries over his replacement in last weekend’s La Liga fixture with his club, as he said that his injury was not a seriously one and will be fit before joining the Super Eagles’ camp in Asaba on Sunday, June 2. Omeruo insisted that his withdrawal was just a precautionary measure by his club, considering that their opponents, Huesca, were already relegated. Omeruo chose not to dwell on his withdrawal and the result of the match which his team lost 2-1, as he said he was already thinking about getting a short holiday with his wife, before heading to the Super Eagles’ camp, before which he said he will be fine. “I will be fine, it was nothing too serious. It was just a kick to my knee and the substitution was just a precautionary one. “I will be going on holidays with my family for now before returning home for the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) preparations,” Omeruo told AOIFootball.com

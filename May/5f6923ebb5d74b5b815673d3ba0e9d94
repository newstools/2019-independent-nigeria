OSOGBO – Senator-elect for Osun East Senatorial District, Prince Francis Adenigba Fadahunsi, has described the latest security challenge in the south west region as precarious and unacceptable, calling on Yoruba leaders and traditional rulers to rise up to the challenge. Fadahunsi, in a statement by his media assistant, Sam Segun-Progress, said the recent cases of kidnap in the Southwest region called for immediate action before a negative reaction mar the fragile peace of the region. Fadahunsi said, “The increase in the rate of kidnapping and other heinous activities of cattle rustlers in the south west could spark protest if the federal governments through the security agencies remains reluctant in addressing it with every sense of patriotism and zeal. “It is a known knowledge that the region is surrounded by herdsmen, who are seen with sophisticated weapons migrating from one place to another destroying farms and terrorising the people from village to village. “The Akure- Ilesa- Ife- Ibadan express way has become a dangerous path and internal roads in Oriade and Obokun local governments have become another den of criminals.”

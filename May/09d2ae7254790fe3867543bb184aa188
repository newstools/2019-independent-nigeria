ENUGU – The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has expressed worry over high rate of cybercrime, popularly called (Yahoo, yahoo) in Nigeria. The alarm was raised by the South East Zonal Head of EFCC, Usman Imam in Enugu on Friday, while briefing journalists on the activities of the EFCC in the first quarter of 2019. According to him, the cases of cybercrime had become alarming in the zone. He said “investigations so far made, it is unfortunate that some parents are not only aware of their children’s involvements but even abet such terrible crime. “What is very worrisome is that most of the perpetrators of this crime are either students of institutions of higher learning, graduates, youth corps members or secondary school students learning from their elders. “To think that these criminals are those who will in future take up the responsibility of leading this country must certainly send shivers down the spine of any right thinking Nigerian,” he said. Imam disclosed that the commission had within the period under review seized several exotic cars from suspected ‘Yahoo Yahoo Boys’ which were being investigated. “How can a student own a car worth about N10 million? That is what we have been seeing,” he queried. He thereby urged Nigerian youths to toe the path of honesty, adding that anybody convicted on cybercrime would live with such stigma for the rest of their lives. “I want to appeal to parents to take up their God-given responsibilities of monitoring their children or wards. In the South East, the case of internet or cybercrimes is very alarming,” he said.

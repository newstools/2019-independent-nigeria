BAUCHI – Coalition of Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) in Bauchi State under the auspices of Bauchi State Network of Civil Society (BASNEC) has condemned the latest bill passed by the state House of Assembly, barring government’s panels or committees from probing and recovering public properties and funds from suspected corrupt public office holders in the state. BASNEC, in a statement signed by Comrade Sadiq Sadiq, its Secretary General, said it was improper for the lawmakers to pass such bill, saying there was a law enacted in 2017 tagged ‘Bauchi State Public Property and Fund Recovery Tribunal Law’ that empowered government to recover looted items and money from public officers. Sadiq, who described BASNEC as an umbrella body of CSOs across the 20 local governments of the state with a mission to improve civic participation through advocacy and synergy of civil society actors for good governance towards effective service delivery in the state, said such bill would encourage corruption.

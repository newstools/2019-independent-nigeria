LAGOS – Maduka Okoye, Fortuna Düsseldorf II of Germany goalkeeper, has expressed his readiness to be in post for the Nigeria’s Under-23 national team, the Olympic Eagles, in the 2019 African U-23 Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifier against Sudan next month. Okoye, who was delighted to be invited to the team, said he sees the invitation as a huge opportunity for him to prove his allegiance to the country. DAILY INDEPENDENT gathered that the invitation comes hot on the heels of Okoye’s decision to commit his international future to his father’s country and, though he earlier had an option to stick with Germany, the young keeper said he is looking ahead to donning Nigeria’s green-and-white jersey. That opportunity could come as early as next month, when the Olympic Eagles line out against Sudan in the next match of the 2019 AFCON U-23 qualifiers,and Okoye said he just cannot wait to get going. He hinted further in a post on social media that he is equally looking ahead to starring for Nigeria at the Olympic Games soccer event in Tokyo, Japan, where he would love to make history for the nation. “I’m coming Home Nigeria! After 13 years. Can’t describe my feelings. Looking forward to the Qualifying match with the U23 against Sudan. #Olympia2020”, he posted. It would be recalled that the 19-year-old shot-stopper missed Nigeria’s first stage of the U-23 AFCON qualifiers against Libya due to club engagements, but the lad with a Nigerian father and German mother said he is available for next month’s battles with Sudan. The first leg of the qualifier will hold in Khartoum on Wednesday, June 5 with the reverse fixture four days later at the Samson Siasia Stadium, Yenegoa, Bayelsa State.

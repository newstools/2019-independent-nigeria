LAGOS – Still smarting from their success at the just concluded 2019 WAFU Women’s Cup tournament in Abidjan, Cote d’Ivoire, the Super Falcons of Nigeria will today (Monday) begin their pre-World Cup final camp in Austria.

All overseas-based professionals will travel directly to the Avita Resort camp in Austria. On Sunday, Nigeria swept to glory in the 2019 WAFU Cup tournament as the Super Falcons edged host nation Cote d’Ivoire 5-4 after penalty shootout in an interesting final match at the Stade Robert Champroux. The Ivoirians took the lead in the 43rd minute of the encounter when Spain-based Ange Koko N’Guessan, who also scored for the Dame Elephants against Mali in the semifinal, beat goalkeeper Chiamaka Nnadozie with a marvelous free-kick. Afterwards, the African champions created several chances without making hay. It was left to leggy forward Uchenna Kanu, the USA-based student, to draw Nigeria level in the fourth minute of added time in the second half. In the penalty shoot-out, Amarachi Okoronkwo, Maryam Ibrahim, Alice Ogebe, Joy Bokiri and Captain Evelyn Nwabuoku made no mistake from the spot, while the Ivorians lost one of their kicks.

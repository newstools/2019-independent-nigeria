Mick Jagger is going back on the road following his medical recovery, people.com has reported. On Thursday, the Rolling Stones announced the newly rescheduled concert dates for their No Filter tour after they were postponed in March due to their frontman undergoing a “medical treatment.” “We are delighted to announce the new US and Canada tour dates today!” the band announced. “All of the cities from the previously postponed shows are locked in, starting at Soldier Field in Chicago on June 21st and including a brand new date in New Orleans!” The North American leg will pick up on June 21 in Chicago before capping it off in Miami on Aug. 31. Doctors advised Jagger, 75, in March that he couldn’t go on tour at the time due to “medical treatment.” The circumstance was, according to reports from Billboard and Rolling Stone, a heart valve surgery. He announced in April that he was “feeling much better” and “on the mend.” This Wednesday, Jagger then shared a video of him back in a rehearsal space, dancing in front of a mirror as proof of his bounce back.

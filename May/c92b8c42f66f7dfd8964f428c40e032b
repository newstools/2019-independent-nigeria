LAGOS – The Centre for Anti-Corruption and Open Leadership (CACOL) has expressed support for the financial autonomy of States’ Legislative And Judiciary Arms Bill, hitherto passed by the National Assembly and as assented to by Mr. President, who has set up an implementation committee on the matter. Mr. Debo Adeniran, CACOL’s Executive Chairman, in a statement issued by Adegboyega Otunuga, its Coordinator for Media and Publications, recall that last year, the National Assembly initiated and passed a bill giving financial autonomy to states’ legislature and the judiciary. The purpose of the law, he stressed, was to limit the amount of interference and control the Executive arm could exercise on those two vital arms that traditionally constitute the government in conjunction with the executive arm. Adeniran also recalled that shortly after the advent of this democracy in 1999, the legislative arm at the federal level was able to secure its financial autonomy by not only preparing its own budget heads, but also allocating resources for itself in terms of what salary, emoluments and other allowances were accorded its officials, some of which are not just alien to the 1999 Nigerian Constitution, but offensive to the morality of the nation (example is the constituency projects) with some of this running into billions in monetary categorisation

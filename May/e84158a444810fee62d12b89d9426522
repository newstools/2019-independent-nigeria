Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Chris Hemsworth and his wife Elsa Pataky ”butt heads” in their romance because they’re both ”pretty damn stubborn”. The 35-year-old actor has been married to Elsa since 2010, and has said that whilst there’s ”nothing” that annoys him about his spouse, the pair do tend to have disagreements because neither of them will budge on their opinions. He said: ”I can be pretty damn stubborn, so can she, which is probably where we tend to butt heads occasionally. But we’ve done pretty well to still be trucking along quite nicely, all things considered. We both have strong opinions and also both have a great amount of enthusiasm for what we believe in.” The ‘Avengers: Endgame’ actor has daughter India, seven, and five-year-old twins Sasha and Tristan with Elsa, and has joked that although he believes he’s the ”perfect” husband, he says Elsa would have a ”long list” of things that annoy her about him. He added: ”What annoys her about me? Probably if I surf a little long or stay out a little late from time to time. But that’s usually because of traffic! What would annoy her? I’m perfect, nothing. But I can’t wait for you to ask her that question. She’ll give you a long list of things!” But Chris doesn’t have that same long list for 42-year-old model Elsa, as he refused to dish on her negative traits because he wants to stay on her good side. Speaking to News.com.au, he said: ”Well, if she’s reading this, ‘nothing annoys me about her!’ I gotta make sure there is a place for me in the bed when I get back home.” Although nothing about his spouse annoys the ‘Thor’ star, Elsa did recently admit he gets ”really embarrassed” when she tells their brood off in public, because she’s so ”loud”. She said: ”Everybody here, when they tell off their kids, they’re like [whispering] but we are totally opposite. ”We are loud and sometimes Chris gets really embarrassed. He’s like, ‘Stop it, everyone’s looking at us.’ ”

LAGOS – The Concessionaire of Funtua Inland Dry Port (FID) has stated that over $20 million intervention fund is needed to get the port operational within one year. Mr. Usman Iya-Abass, the Managing Director of Equatorial Marine Oil and Gas Company Limited, stated this in Katsina over the weekend, during the inspection of the port alongside with the Nigerian Shippers Council (NSC). According to him, the port was concessioned to the company since 2006 and had made remarkable progress in terms of development. He, however, said that the devaluation of Naira against dollar and other major currencies in recent time had affected the progress and the total cost to get it operational. Iya-Abbas explained that the initial cost of the project was estimated at $3bn, but with the current exchange rate, it had skyrocketed further.

We are looking at facilities between $20 and $50m. He, however, assured that once the company received the intervention, the dry port would commence operation within six months to one year. “If we are able to get the financing, between six months to a year, we will start operation because as it is now, the basic infrastructure has being laid, what is left is the trailer parks and ICT infrastructure,” he said.

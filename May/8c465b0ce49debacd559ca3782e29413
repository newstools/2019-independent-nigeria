LAGOS – Nigeria’s female top sprinter, Blessing Okagbare-Ighotegunor, has qualified for 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan, following her silver medal placement at the Diamond League meet in Shanghai, China. The 2008 Beijing Olympics long jump bronze medalist is now on course for her fourth appearance at the Games and becomes the sixth Nigerian athlete to qualify for the World Championship, behind Divine Oduduru, Raymond Ekevwo, Tobi Amusan, Ese Brume and Ebuka Enekwechi. Although Okagbare-Ighoteguonor’s season’s best time of 11.07 seconds could only see her finish behind Aleia Hobbs of USA (11.03) it was good enough to qualify her for the Games. Her time was also a ticket to this year’s International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) World Championships, holding in Doha, Qatar, as she placed ahead of double Olympic champion, Elaine Thompson, who was third in 11.14 seconds.

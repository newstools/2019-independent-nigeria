ABUJA – The Minister of Communications, Barr. Adebayo Shittu, has emphasized the need for Nigeria to bridge the standardisation gap in the Information Communications Technology (ICT) sector. Shittu, who stated this in Abuja in his address on the occasion to celebrate World Telecommunication and Information Society Day 2019 (WTISD), said one of the strategic objectives of ITU’s standardisation sector (ITU-T) was to address the disparities in the ability of developing countries, relative to developed ones, to access, implement and influence ITU’s international standards. The minister,who was represented by the Director, Radio Monitoring and Survey in the Ministry, Engr. Kilyobas Binga, implored all stakeholders and government at levels, to put up stiff measures that would bridge the standardisation gap. He said: “The overarching goal of the Bridging the Standardisation Gap (BSG) programme is to facilitate increased participation of developing countries in standardisation, to ensure that developing countries experience the economic benefits of associated technological development, and to better reflect the requirements and interests of developing countries in the standards-development process”. Shittu added that ITU standards are consistently being pursued to ensure interoperability, open up global markets and spur innovation and growth noting that the standards are good for both the developed and developing countries as well as to help accelerate ICTs for all Sustainable Development Goals. “As a digital immigrant, whether you want to connect to the internet, enjoy sports event on television, listen to radio in your car or watch a video on your smart phone, ITU standards make it possible seamlessly, given the ubiquitous mobile broadband. “It is on this basis that I want to join the ITU body in calling on member states, industry members, small and big companies and academia, together with UN sister agencies, all stakeholders to support the bridging of standardisation gap programme for the prosperity and well-being of all,’’he added.

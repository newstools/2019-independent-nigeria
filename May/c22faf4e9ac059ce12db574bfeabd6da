Moussa Sissoko can count himself very unlucky not to win the Player of the Year award at Spurs following a terrific season in north London. With his long-term future in N17 looking in serious doubt after two frustrating years at the club, the Frenchman has completed a remarkable turnaround this campaign. Producing dominant displays in the middle of the park week in, week out and now one of the first names on the teamsheet, the 29-year-old has played a major role in the team’s run to the Champions League final with some outstanding performances against the likes of Inter Milan, Barcelona and Ajax. Given that Sissoko’s contract expires at Spurs at the end of the 2020/21 season, it certainly wouldn’t be a surprise to see him sign fresh terms in the not too distant future. Hosting a Q&A session on his Instagram page over the past day, the midfielder was inundated with a number of questions about his Spurs career and his teammates. One Instagram user even labelled Sissoko as the greatest player of all time (GOAT) but he was having none of it. Instead he stated that Spurs teammate Son Heung-min is the greatest player of all time and then went on to explain why he calls him ‘Yacou’.

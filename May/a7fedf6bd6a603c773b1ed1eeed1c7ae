Lagos – Hon. Daniel Igali, President of the Nigeria Wrestling Federation (NWF) is confident wrestling can win no fewer than 10 gold medals for Team Nigeria at this year’s All-Africa Games in Rabat, Morocco. The World and Olympic champion has therefore called for early camping and adequate preparations ahead of the 12th edition of the AAG which will be staged from August 19 to 31, 2019. DAILY INDEPENDENT learnt that after overcoming financial difficulties in March, Igali led a contingent of 16 Nigerian wrestlers to the 2019 Africa Senior Wrestling Championships in Hammamet, Tunisia, where they won 13 medals including six gold, two silver and five bronze medals, with the female team voted the best at the tournament. “We must start preparing right away,” he advised. “From what I did see at the African Championships, the females have the capacity to win between seven and eight gold medals. If we prepare from now, I can almost guarantee that we will win about seven and eight gold medals with the women alone. “I also see the possibility of winning about four gold medals in the men, which takes us to over 10 gold medals which is about our target for the Games. “So, that gives me a lot of course for optimism. I’m very optimistic that if we prepare well, and that is depending on our preparations, if we start our preparation now, because we are about three solid months away from the Games, if we start our preparation in terms of the physical training now, and then we go to the specifics in June, and tipper off in July, then, by August I think we will be fine to go and do the country proud,” he said. It will be recalled that Nigeria won the wrestling event at the last AAG in Brazzaville, Congo four years ago claiming 19 medals comprising nine gold, five silver and five bronze.

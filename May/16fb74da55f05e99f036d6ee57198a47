LAGOS – While the Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN) is engulfed in a financial crisis with the world athletics governing body, IAAF, Nigerian sprinter, Divine Oduduru has qualified for the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan. Oduduru continued his fine form for Texas Tech University as he raced to victory in 9.99 seconds to defend the 100m title he won last year, and became the first to ever to break the sub- 10s in the 100m at the Big-12 Championship, thus taking after fellow international star, Raymond Ekevwo to qualify for the 2020 Olympic. Oduduru finished ahead of Joseph Sheffield who finished second in 10.29secs and Micaiah Harris in 10.34 seconds in third position. Oduduru’s time in the 100m final knocks off the Big-12 record of 10.03secs set in 2012 by Prezel Hardy Jr. and also doubles as the Stadium Record, taking down a long-term one held by John Garrison since 1976 at 10.04s. Oduduru’s 9.99s mark has also qualified him for the 2020 Games making him the second male athlete after Ekevwo recorded a Personal Best (PB) of 10.02 seconds 24 hours earlier at the SEC Championships. The Delta-born also ran the second leg in the 4x100m alongside his team mates Andrew Hudson, Keion Sutton and Jacolby Shelton, to set a new School Record (SR) of 38.83s and a new Big-12 Record. The same quartet set the previous record earlier in the season at the Texas Relays. It is the fourth time in as many Big-12 Championships; the Texas Tech men’s team hoisted the team trophy as dominant victors over the rest of the conference.

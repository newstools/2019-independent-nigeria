Sagay in a statement on Wednesday also advised the legal team of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to apply for a review of the two judgments. He said “The Zamfara and Rivers State judgments are a national tragedy. We should not allow our legal system to throw up such unimaginable injustice. This major judicial disenfranchisement of the Zamfara and Rivers electorate should be reversed”. “I advise the APC legal team to apply for a review of the two judgments. Their Lordships ought to be given an opportunity to reverse this unprecedented tragedy”. “The prefix “Justice” preceding the names of Supreme Court and Court of Appeal Judges is significant, for it prescribes what they stand for and what they represent, JUSTICE!”

The government must invest in this sector and turn around the economy of our dear state in line with the dream of the founding fathers of the state .Most world class events and festival have not been able to stand the test of time because they are either not sponsor’s friendly or lack the contents that attract sponsorship. But this crowd-pulling Oladunwo cultural festival in Okemesi is worth celebrating because of its uniqueness”.

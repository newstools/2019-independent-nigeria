The AGGIN, in a press statement made available to journalists, called on the leadership of the Nigeria Labour Congress and the in-coming governor to strike a deal in ensuring smooth take-off of the new administration. Workers in the state across all levels, including teachers, began indefinite strike last week to press their demands for payment of arrears of promotion benefits; arrears of salaries owed some local governments; tertiary institutions, among others. The group urged Makinde to honour all agreements he made to his coalition partners spearheaded by a former governor, Rashidi Ladoja, so as to hit the ground running for industrial harmony.

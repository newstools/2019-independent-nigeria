LAGOS – The Tourism and Technology Summit has been endorsed by the Ministry of Tourism Arts and Culture Lagos State and by extension the Lagos State Government. In a statement detailing the reason for this endorsement, the state asserted that they found the summit viable and very likely to add value to Lagos State vision on Tourism Arts and Culture. The state noted that Africa has huge potentials for tourism through their youthful population, but is still struggling with an uncharted and uncoordinated roadmap to achieve huge windfalls from that sector. Experts have advised on how to reconstruct the Tourism ecosystem in Africa through technology by identifying challenges and opportunities. Emerging Startups and an SME Ecosystem could just be the trigger needed for the role in redefining Tourism in Africa as a whole. The Tourism And Technology Summit aims to develop a roadmap for emerging innovations for the Travel and Tourism space in Africa and provide a platform to showcase these innovations to the world through the Summit. The primary aim for this community would be to engender solutions to numerous problems facing the tourism sector in Africa and how it can be easier to deploy technology to solve these problems. The Summit comes up on May 30, 2019 at the Oriental Hotel Lagos and would host an array of seasoned speakers from both the travel, tourism and technology sectors. Brandworld Media in partnership with Technology Mirror and Sua-Global Infinity Concepts is organising the Summit: Tourism And Technology Summit 2019 with the theme: Buillding A New Ecosystem For Tourism In Africa Innovation, Disruption ,Technology.

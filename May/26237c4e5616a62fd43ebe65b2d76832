The court presided over by Hon. Hassan Muhammad said the suspects; three males and a female were arraigned on a three-count charge of criminal conspiracy, cheating and extortion of sick and vulnerable people. According to the First Investigation Report (FIR), the three accused were apprehended on 18th May in Kubwa for allegedly assembling cancer patients and taking them round the FCT soliciting for funds. Saying, the suspects namely Princess, Victor, Francis, Mankinde and one person at large acted dishonestly by converting the funds realised on behalf of the sick persons for their personal benefit. Meanwhile, after the FIR charge was read out to them, all the accused persons denied the alleged offences. Consequently, following a no guilty plea by the accused, the prosecuting counsel, Barr. Donatus Abah, made an application to the court, for them to be remanded in prison pending hearing proper. The defence counsel, Pius Onigah swiftly applied for bail to be granted to the accused persons, as the offences are bailable in nature. After a strong objection to the bail application, the trial judge ordered that accused persons be remanded in Keffi Prison, and adjourned the matter till 29 May for further hearing.

LAGOS – Prices of beans especially the brown species which  started declining in December last year  after a persistent rise for a very long time, reduced further  in January 2019, this year, and since then, maintained a downward trend. The commodity which is very rich in protein is commonly found on the menu list of most Nigerian homes. Many people are of the opinion that beans are mostly consumed by men; likewise, nursing mothers patronise the commodity because of the health benefits associated with the consumption of beans. The commodity is a multi-purpose meal and as such can be used for moimoi, akara and even porridge. The steady decline in the prices of the commodity has enabled many traders to sustain their normal purchases, which they once reduced due to its prohibitive prices. During the week, visits to various markets across the states by the Business and Market Intelligence Unit of DAILY INDEPENDENT, indicated that prices of the commodity which had remained stable since February this year fell slightly by 5 per cent in April 30, 2019. Many of the traders attributed the drop in the prices of beans to low patronage, increased supply from the North and lack of purchasing power. During the week, checks at the Dei-Dei Market, Abuja,  by SUNDAY INDEPENDENT, showed that prices of the commodity were still at a descending trend, especially with the prices of a 100kg bag of brown beans still going for between N25,000 an N26,000 down from N32,000 initially sold. That of Achau Market, Kaduna, that went for between N26,000 and N27,000 decreased marginally, currently ranging from N25,500 to N26,000. Mallam Yaqub Maina, a trader at Achau Market, Kaduna, linked the drop to seasonal factors usually associated with availability. He, however, opined that the reduction in the prices of the commodity had not translated into sales, a situation which he blamed on the state of the economy. The same could be said for that of Delta State, as visit to Ogbeogologo Market, Asaba, by our correspondent showed that prices of brown beans regardless of the species witnessed a decrease. For example, prices of a 100kg bag of brown beans (drum) that attracted between N36,000 and 36,500 dropped  by 3 per cent to N35,000 within the week under review. This, however, depends on the size of the bag and the haggling power of the buyer. A lady who simply identified herself as Lizzy at the Ogbeogologo Market, Asaba,  but retails the commodity said that despite the drop, prices of the commodity were still on the high side especially when compared with they were previously. This is just as Mr. Charles Ibe, another trader of the same market shared similar opinion with her, but specifically linked the genesis of the situation to Boko Haram insurgency in the North, resulting to scarcity. That of Ose Market, Onitsha Market, was still at a downward trend; for instance prices of a 100kg bag of brown beans (drum) that fell further to between N34,000 and N35,000  remained unchanged, of which many of the traders attributed to low demand  and lack of purchasing power despite the reduction in prices.  That of Itam Market, Uyo, reduced the more to between N34,000 and N35,000 from N36,000 initially sold. In Lafenwa Market, Ogun State, prices of beans were still at a sliding trend, currently ranging from N32,500 to N33,000 against N34,000 sold last month, signifying a 5 per cent drop. Mr. Raimi Abu, who trades in the commodity and all kinds of grains at the Lafenwa Market, in a chat with SUNDAY INDEPENDENT connected the decline to sufficient supply and low patronage. For King’s Market Ado-Ekiti, prices of beans still remained lower than what they were sold previously owing to availability. For example, a 100kg bag of brown beans that earlier attracted between N33,500 and N34,000 declined slightly to N33,000, a situation which many of the  traders considered a good omen, hoping it would further  reduce sharply. At the Bodija Market, Ibadan, the situation  was not conflicting  with what was obtained in other markets as prices of the commodity  has remained stable since early this year. For instance, a bag of beans that decreased to between N32,000 and N33,000 early this year,  fell marginally, currently ranging from N31,000 to N32,000 depending on the specie and the bargaining power of the customer. A lady who came to shop for food items at the Bodija Market, Ibadan, said she never thought prices of the commodity would drop after remaining exorbitant for a very long time. She was very optimistic that with increased supply and complete eradication of insurgents in the North so that some farmers can go back to their farms without fear, prices of the commodity would certainly drop further. In Lagos, visits to popular markets such as Mile 12, Iddo and Daleko markets where beans are obtained in wholesale and reasonable prices, the trend at which they were sold previously had not changed but instead fell further slightly. Prices of a 100kg bag of brown beans at the Mile 12 Market, currently goes for between N30,000 and N35,000 depending on the specie. That of drum popularly referred to as olotu by Lagosian traders dropped to between N33,000 and N34,000 from N35,000 sold in the previous month. The decline in the prices of the commodity also reflected in the purchases of consumers who buy in smaller measures. For instance, prices of a paint bucket that reduced to between N1,250 and N1,300 from N1,900 previously  sold  reduced the more to between N900 and N1,200 depending on the market and location. Mr. Nnaji Chibuzor who sells the commodity at the Daleko market connected the decline to improved supply and lack of money.

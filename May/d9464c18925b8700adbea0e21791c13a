Powered by RubiQube Ad Network BENIN – Monday Edegbe, a former Chairman of the outlawed Community Development Association (CDA) of Uniaro Community in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State is now in Police net over an alleged murder of one Mrs. Mercy Nosakhare Iserhienrhien in the community. The 59- year-old woman was said to have been given a head boot on her chest by the suspect (Monday Edegbe) on May 4th 2019 in the community which eventually led to the death of the woman. The tragedy has led to spontaneous reaction from a legal practitioner in the state, Olayiwola Afolabi who petitioned the Commissioner of Police, Edo State Command, to intervene in the gruesome murder of Mrs. Mercy Nosakhare Iserhienrhien with a view to bring peace and justice to the law abiding citizens of Uniaro village. Speaking with newsmen in the community, the eldest daughter of the deceased, Mrs. Iris Nosakhare Aderemi, said her mother’s death would have been averted if security agents in the State had taken seriously the reports of the elders of Uniaro Community to checkmate the excesses of the said Monday Edegbe. According to her, peace has eluded the people of Uniaro Community since Edo State government outlawed CDAs, in the State with the support of the Oba of Benin which subsequently led to the appointment of Okaeghele, Mr. Nosakhare Iserhienrhien Osemwegie by the Odionwere. This she said did not go down well with the said suspect as he brought thugs to unleash terror on the people of the community even as frivolous cases were alleged levelled against them for prompt arrest.

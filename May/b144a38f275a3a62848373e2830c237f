Powered by RubiQube Ad Network There was plenty of talk about him coming to Celtic, but if the reports are true, André Villas Boas would have been a big ask. The Portuguese boss, who carries a CV with him that features names like Porto, Chelsea, Spurs and Zenit St. Petersburg, was one of the names being bandied about in the run-up to Neil Lennon being handed the manager’s position on a full-time basis. Even if the job was still available though, if reports coming in from France Football are to be believed, his wage demands would have surely ruled out any shock appearance in Scotland. The site are reporting that Marseille have reached an salary agreement with André Villas-Boas for him to become their new manager. That contract agreed is set to run for two years on a pre-tax salary of an incredible €600k a month, equating to €7.2 million a year.  This is still a considerable wage concession from AVB considering he was earning €8.5m a year at Zenit and an astonishing €12m when at Shanghai SIPG. While the details are still to be signed off, those kind of numbers are further proof of the widening gap between Scottish football and the rest of Europe.

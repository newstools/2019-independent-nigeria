LAGOS – Governor Umaru Tanko Al-Makura Nasarawa State has requested for more time to be able to compile and provide details on the spending by the state on security votes as requested by a non-governmental organisation, Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP). Al-Makura said the Freedom of Information (FoI) Act required by SERAP would take more than seven days to process given that the information being requested covers a period of eight years. The governor’s response followed FoI Act requests SERAP sent last month to him and 35 other state governors as well as President Muhammadu Buhari, asking them to provide information on specific details of spending of appropriated public funds as security votes between 2011 and 2019, given the current security realities in the country. It would be recalled that SERAP in April sent separate FoI requests to 36 state governors and Mr Buhari, stating that: “We need the information to determine if public funds meant to provide security and ensure respect and protection of the rights to life, physical integrity, and liberty of Nigerians have been spent for this purpose. “Our request is limited to details of visible, specific security measures and projects executed and does not include spending on intelligence operations.” SERAP’s FoI requests to the 36 state governors and the Federal Government read in part: “Section 14(2) (b) of the 1999 Nigerian Constitution (as amended) provides that the security and welfare of the people shall be the primary purpose of government.’ It is the security of the citizens that is intended and not the security of select individuals in public office. “Transparency and accountability in the spending of security votes are critically important to fully implement this responsibility imposed on both the federal and state governments.”

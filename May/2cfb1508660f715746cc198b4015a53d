Lagos – Governor Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State has sacked the Anyansi-Agwu-led board of the Enyimba Football Club of Aba, thus bringing to an end what be a glorious reign of the imposing club chairman. Also sacked by the governor is the Emeka Inyama-led board of Abia Warriors. Incidentally, the governor sacked the boards of other state government organisations in a major shakeup the state government took. Anyansi-Agwu was named Enyimba chairman in 1999 and he superintended the glorious era of the former African champions where they won two CAF Champions League titles, two CAF Super Cup titles and seven Nigerian topflight as well as four Nigerian Federation Cups and four Nigerian Super Cups in a reign spanning 20 years. Inyama was named the chairman of Abia Warriors in 2012 after its name changed from Orji Uzor Kalu (OUK) FC. In a press release, the governor thanked the respective boards for their services to the state and directed the affected members to hand over all government documents and properties to the relevant offices. “Abia State Governor, Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu, has approved the immediate dissolution of the boards of the following establishments in the state,” the press release read.

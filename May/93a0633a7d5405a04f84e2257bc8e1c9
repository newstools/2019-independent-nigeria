Efforts by the Afghan government to combat widespread corruption in the country has yet to impact the lives of most Afghans, the UN said on Monday. According to a report from the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), in spite of numerous political and legal reforms, corruption remains a major obstacle to long-term development, peace and prosperity in Afghanistan. “Corruption continues to undermine public confidence towards the Afghan government and affects all aspects of life in Afghanistan,’’ the report said. It added that the implementation of laws designed to prevent corruption and prosecute those involved remains difficult. In September, 127 arrest warrants and subpoenas were pending at the Anti-Corruption Justice Centre (ACJC) but the agency was only able to execute 13 arrest warrants and 39 summonses by the end of November. “Only a single defendant was tried. Some suspects are being released before trial, and orders not to leave the country are not being enforced,’’ the report said. The country is beset by corruption on top of the ongoing war. According to Transparency International’s 2018 Corruption Perception Index, Afghanistan ranked 172nd,  up from 177th in 2017.

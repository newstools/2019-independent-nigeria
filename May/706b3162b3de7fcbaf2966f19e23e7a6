ASABA – The battle for the soul of Delta North Senatorial District between the incumbent Senator Peter Nwaoboshi and Prince Ned Nwoko has been resolved by the court and the lndependent National Electoral Commission, INEC. INEC has issued Certificate of Return to Prince Ned Nwoko as the duly elected Senator for the district for the 9th National Assembly. This was sequel to a Federal High Court judgment in Abuja which nullified the election of Nwaoboshi and declared Nwoko winner of the PDP Delta North senatorial primary. Nwoko, a British trained lawyer and philanthropist, received the Certificate on Friday 10th May 2019, at INEC headquarters in Abuja amidst jubilation by hordes of enthusiastic supporters. Delivering judgment in Abuja on April 3rd 2019, the Presiding Judge, Hon Justice A. R Mohammed had ruled that from all available evidence before the court, Nwoko convincingly won the Delta North PDP senatorial primary election held on 2nd October, 2018. By implication of the judgment and the INEC Certificate of Return, Nwoko stands as Senator-elect for Delta North senatorial district and Certificate of Return earlier issued to Nwaoboshi is now invalid in accordance with the electoral Act. Nwoko confirmed this Friday night in a telephone conversation with Sunday INDEPENDENT, saying that the development would herald a beautiful future for the people of Delta North.

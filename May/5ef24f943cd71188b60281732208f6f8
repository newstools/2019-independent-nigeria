Swiss continues positive clay-court season
Roger Federer is back. After a three-year absence, the 2009 champion returned to Roland Garros on Sunday with a straightforward 6-2, 6-2, 6-4 win against Italian Lorenzo Sonego. The Swiss broke five times and hit 36 winners to get off the court in less than two hours. Federer missed the 2016 Roland Garros because of injury and chose to skip the 2017 and 2018 clay-court swings to prepare for the grass-court season. But he’s returned to the European swing with success this year, making the quarter-finals in both Madrid and Rome, although he pulled out of the ATP Masters 1000 in Rome because of a leg injury, a decision Federer later described as “precautionary”. The Swiss won his only Roland Garros title 10 years ago, beating Swede Robin Soderling in the final to complete the Career Grand Slam. He made the quarter-finals in 2015, falling to countryman Stan Wawrinka. Federer will next meet German lucky loser Oscar Otte, who beat Tunisian Malek Jaziri 6-3, 6-3, 4-6, 6-0.

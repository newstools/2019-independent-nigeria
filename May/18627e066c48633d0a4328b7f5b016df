ILORIN – Leaders of the All Progressives Party (APC) in south senatorial district of Kwara State have countered the position of some elders of the party in the district seeking non-inclusion of the Minister for Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed in the next cabinet of President Muhammadu Buhari. The elders, led by James Ayeni, a former chairman of a local government in the district during the military era had alleged that Mohammed, who hails from the district did not participate in activities of the APC in the state until it was obvious that the party was poised for victory at the poll. They therefore called on President Buhari not to reappoint him as a minister. But, the APC leaders, who are chairmen of the party in seven local government areas of the district, faulted the claim of the elders on the contributions of Mohammed to the party, saying the contributions aided victory of the party in the election. The chairmen, in a statement said the people were wrong to have claimed to be speaking as elders because no elder’s forum has been constituted to speak on behalf of the district. Some of the chairmen who signed the statement are Mohammed Shilo, Aransiola Oyeyemi Samson, Bamidele Ogunbayo, Muhideen Shittu, Olawale Awelewa, Taiye Olaniyi and Yusuf Abdulganiyu Kehinde. The statement reads: “Our attention had been drawn to the press release issued on the 22nd May 2019 by some elders claiming to be speaking for Kwara South APC elders. This should be disregarded in its entirety and whatever it stands for.

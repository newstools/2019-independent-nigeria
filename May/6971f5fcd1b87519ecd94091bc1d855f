AWKA – The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has restated its resolve to lockdown ‘Biafra land’ on May 30 and praised its branches all over the world for securing protest venues and marching permits for that day. In a statement issued by Comrade Emma Powerful, its media and publicity secretary, Tuesday, the group said its chapters worldwide have resolved to prove on May 30 both in Biafraland and beyond that IPOB “remains the pre-eminent freedom fighting outfit anywhere on this earth at this present moment.” It said, “Biafrans both home and abroad must honour and remember our heroes and heroines that died to stop the total Islamisation of the sacred land of Biafra and perpetual enslavement of the children of God.” It boasted that all IPOB family units outside Biafraland in over 88 countries and territories around the world, are expected to take part in street demonstrations, rallies, lectures and prayers to ensure the remembrance of their fallen heroes and heroines on May 30, 2019. “It will go down in history as one of the greatest events of our time,” it stated. The group commended IPOB families in the United Kingdom, Europe, Asia, Middle East, USA and many others across the world that have secured marching permits from their relevant authorities for the event. It specifically named Angola, Mozambique, Congo DRC, Namibia, Ghana and Tanzania as countries in Africa where they have perfected their own arrangements to honour Biafran heroes and heroines that day. It also said IPOB family members in the UK have secured their venue at Trafalgar Square London for a rally, saying the group is praised for holding peaceful protests. It warned those it described as “criminally minded individuals, DSS informants, traitors and Biafra-for-hire groups hiding under the banner of Biafra agitation to serve Miyetti Allah agenda through Al Mustapha, bringing shame and ridicule on themselves.”

He admonished that the country needs to urgently start working on the famed potential to achieve economic growth. Rewane stated that labour productivity in the country is very poor and that if that must be corrected to achieve GDP growth that is commensurate with our size and resources, the economy must make hard choices. “GDP growth can be achieved if we fix our weak infrastructure. The power sector problem, for instance, continues to be a huge burden with the sector hampered by enormous debt overhang and the inability to attract fresh financing. But this can easily be corrected if the debts are converted to equities,” he said. Nigeria Needs Regional Industrialisation To Grow–Omoleh

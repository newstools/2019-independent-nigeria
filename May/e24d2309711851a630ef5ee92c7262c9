Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Pomerantz LLP, a law firm, is investigating claims on behalf of investors of Jumia Technologies AG (“Jumia” or the “Company”). According to a statement issued by an official of the firm, Robert S. Willoughby, the concerned investors have been advised to contact the law firm. The investigation concerns whether Jumia and certain of its officers and/ or directors have engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices. On May 9, 2019, Citron Research (“Citron”) issued a report alleging that Jumia is the “most obvious fraud” that Citron had ever encountered, citing alleged “material discrepancies” between a confidential investor presentation by Jumia in October 2018 and the Company’s representations to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. According to Citron, Jumia inflated active customer and active merchant numbers by 20 per cent to 30 per cent and concealed the fact that 41 per cent of the company’s orders were returned, not delivered or cancelled. On this news, Jumia’s American depositary receipt (“ADR”) price fell $6.22 per share, or over 18.8 per cent, to close at $26.89 per share on May 9, 2019. Recently, the company dismissed reports by Citron Research that the “Amazon of Africa”, has fraud allegations. The ecommerce giant described the recent allegations as ‘selected, biased or unverified facts’ with what appears to be a clear objective of damaging its brand and business. Juliet Anammah, the Chief Executive Officer, Jumia Nigeria, maintained that the company stands by the disclosures made in the company’s prospectus, during the Initial Public Offer (IPO), which accurately describe the business and the related risks in all material respects.

Lagos – The Lagos State Sports Trust Fund (LSSTF) has assured that it would fulfill its primary mandate of “financing the development and promotion of sports, sporting activities and facilities in the state.” In order to achieve the above objective, it has adopted the Public-Private Partnership model, which has been tested successfully in many advanced nations, such as Australia, UK and Ireland among others. Otunba Olufemi Pedro, former deputy Governor of Lagos State and the LSSTF chairman, who disclosed this on Tuesday in Lagos, said that since this was the first of its kind in Sub-Sahara Africa, it was imperative that “we build a solid foundation for its existence.” According to him, the board has developed a fund raising and communication strategies that would help achieve the set objectives. Part of the objectives, according to him were that 10% of all lottery funds in the state alongside one percent of all local government internally generated revenue in the state would be allocated to the trust fund. He said that the private sector would play a critical role in generating funds, he said that the Trust Fund has “painstakingly embarked on a strategic exercise to craft our vision, mission, and core values.” Some of the core values that have been developed, according to him, were to be accountable; to demonstrate the highest standard of behavior and ethic; to be resourcefulness by finding quick and clever solution to difficult problems; to operate in such a way as to gain the trust of the general public in all ways and innovative by championing new ideas. “The central core of our business is fund raising for sports development using the PPP model. We are therefore set to collaborate with the private sector in general, non-profit organisations, sports equipment manufacturers, sports betting companies, donour agencies, high net worth individuals, high profile elite athletes, media organisations and the general public,” he said.

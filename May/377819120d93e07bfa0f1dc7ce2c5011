As Man City in particular is known to be tracking the midfielder closely and see him as the perfect replacement for Fernandinho, dailystar.co.uk reports. The 22-year-old has expressed a desire to leave Madrid having grown tired of the club’s style of football. The lure of Pep Guardiola and the English club’s willingness to meet his release clause which is just over £60m makes a deal likely. But the Premier League champions now face a genuine battle to seal the deal after Barcelona decided to act on their interest, according to SER. The Spanish giants have already made their intentions clear with the signing of Ajax star Frenkie De Jong. They are also expected to sign Rodri’s team-mate Antoine Griezmann, who decided he wants a new challenge after five seasons under Diego Simeone. Ernesto Valverde, who himself is under pressure following two European horror shows, is now also looking to add Rodri to his midfield. Sergio Busquets and Ivan Rakitic are now both in to their 30s and the club are aware of the need to plan for the future. Munich are also looking add Rodri and have already succeeded in negotiations with the Spanish side having signed Lucas Hernandez for £68m. The Bavarians are set for a summer of transition and have been linked with a move for City’s Leroy Sane. It is unlikely they would be able to afford the Atletico midfielder leaving City and Barcelona to battle it out. Simeone has resigned himself to Rodri’s exit and has identified Real Madrid midfielder Marcos Llorente as his replacement. The Argentine manager is set for a busy summer of rebuilding at the Wanda Metropolitano with Rodri and Griezmann set for the exit door while Diego Godin is also leaving the club.

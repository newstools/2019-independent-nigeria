ABUJA – Dynamic Patriotic Citizens Foundation, a non-governmental organization, has asked Wole Oke, chairman, House of Representatives Committee on Procurement, to disqualify himself from heading an ongoing investigation into the alleged missing N32billion pension funds involving the National Pension Commission (PenCom). The body, in a petition dated 14th May, 2019 and addressed to the House of Representatives Joint Committee on Procurement and Pensions, said it has been following reports regarding some allegations by insider whistle blowers in PenCom that exposed corruption and abuse of office by the acting director general, Aisha Dahiru Umar, who has been acting without a board and executive committee for over two years. Speaking to journalists on the sidelines of the probe, the chairman, Board of Trustees of the NGO, Tolu Babaleye, who co-signed the petition, listed infractions ranging from the missing N33billion pension fund, 300 percent increase in her exit/severance allowance and payment to herself while in office. The petitioners, who questioned the rationale behind the abrupt discontinuation of the ad hoc committee hitherto led by Johnson Agbonayinma, who also resigned his position over alleged conflict of interest. The group also wondered why Wole Oke (PDP, Osun), who was accused by Agbonayinma of conniving with PenCom DG to scandalise his name would head the new investigation when allegations of his interest in the probe were in public domain.

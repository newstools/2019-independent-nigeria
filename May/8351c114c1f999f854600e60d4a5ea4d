Access Bank Pledges Commitment To Project Africa Positively “You cannot achieve success without hard work and excellence. In everything you do, be ready to go the extra mile. The biggest mistake anyone can make is to relent on one’s dream because of the fear that it is too difficult. “Focus on the joy in every activity, don’t let your present circumstances ever determine your future. Don’t let anyone tell you your dreams are too big to be achieved. Beware of friends and peer groups that tell you to take shortcuts, because shortcuts always end in regrets,” he said. He further explained the importance of imbibing good saving habits, stating that was a necessary skill that would help them achieve their goals. He also joined the students in some interesting activities, as they gathered around him for a selfie photograph, which he promised to cherish always. The highlight of the event was the interactive session between the Access Bank CEO and the students. Discussing with a student who explained that the school needed instructional facilities, Wigwe made a commitment to refurbish the school’s Information and Communication Technology (ICT) laboratory.

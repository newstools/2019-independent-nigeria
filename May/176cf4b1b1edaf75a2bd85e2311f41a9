LAGOS – Rasheed Balogun, General Manager of Shooting Stars Sports Club (3SC) of Ibadan, has vowed to ensure that the team gain promotion to the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL). Speaking in Ibadan, Balogun said he would work assiduously to bring the team back to the NPFL adding that with the little resources available, he and his management would ensure that the players pose the best results in the Group B2 where they are currently campaigning for promotion. The Oluyole Warriors are grouped alongside Abia Comets, Bayelsa United, Giant Brillers of Enugu, and Osun United in a round robin league format where the first two will qualify for the play off that will determine which team campaigning in that division will eventually promote. He observed that the 1976 Africa Cup Winners champion, will not rest on its oars as it currently leads the pack with 17 points stressing that the players are quite aware of the task ahead and therefore will not be deceived by the leadership of the group as they have vowed to sustain the momentum. “Although, we are leading the group, this does not guarantee promotion but qualification, so therefore we shall put everything needed to make sure we are promoted” Balogun explained.

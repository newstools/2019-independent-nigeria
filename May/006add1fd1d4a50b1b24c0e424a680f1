Arsenal  are prepared to activate the €36 million (£32m) release clause in Kostas Manolas’ contract with Roma, according to reports in Italy. In a report through metro.co.uk, the Serie A club had been in talks with the Greece international over a new deal but an agreement has not been reached. Earlier this week, Roma announced that their captain Daniele De Rossi would not be renewing his contract and will leave at the end of the season after 18 years at the club. According to Il Messaggero, several Roma players have been unhappy with the way De Rossi’s exit has been handled and are now considering their own futures. Manolas is understood to be one of Roma’s key players who could be leaving this summer and it’s claimed that the Greece international already has one foot out of the door. And both Arsenal and Juventus are potential options for Manloas as they have indicated that they would be ready to pay the 27-year-old’s release clause. Unai Emery’s summer budget is yet to be fully finalised as he could still secure a place in next season’s Champions League if his side beat Chelsea in the Europa League final on May 29. Should Arsenal secure a place in the Champions League their budget could go as high as £100m, but remaining in the Europa League would give Emery around £40m to spend. As well as strengthening their squad, the Gunners are also open to a few high-profile departures including Shkodran Mustafi, who was signed in a £35m deal from Valencia nearly three years ago. Last week, reports in Italy claimed that former Arsenal chief executive Ivan Gazidis now wants to sign Mustafi for AC Milan.

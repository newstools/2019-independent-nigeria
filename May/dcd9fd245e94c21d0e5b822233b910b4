BAUCHI – A group known as Women Coalition for Sustainable Peace and Viable Democratic Gains in Bauchi State has appealed to the Economic Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) and Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission (ICPC) and other anti-graft agencies to investigate the activities of the Bauchi State Agency for Orphans and Vulnerable Children (BASOVCA), particularly the distribution relief assistance donated to orphans by International Islamic Relief Organisation (IIRO). Hajiya Addaji Muhammad, the group’s leader, who spoke to newsmen in Bauchi on Sunday, said they received series of complains from the beneficiaries that 13 percent was removed from the money meant to support their education, while others complained that their names were missing despite that they were screened together with others who received theirs. The beneficiaries also complained of discrepancies in the distribution as some received between 20, 000 to 70,000 while others received 118,000 and 400,000. Muhammad alleged that the initiators of the NGO, known as Support Initiative for Vulnerable Children (SIVWOC), Angarar Yuguda, and Hajiya Baheejah Mahmood Support Initiative, were sidelined by BASOVCA without any genuine reasons and appealed to the anti-graft agencies to intervene and investigate the distribution of the money meant for orphans. When contacted, Ibrahim Abdullahi, BASOVCA state chairman, said the agency only assisted IIRO to trace the beneficiaries, saying the agency heard about the assistance through an Islamic scholar, Sheikh Ibrahim Disina, and sought the approval of the state governor for selecting the beneficiaries in all the 20 local governments. “To put the record straight, BASOVCA did not initiate the programme, the agency only assisted in identifying the beneficiaries. The Islamic Relief Organisation came with the list of 492 people and up till now, we have not reached the targeted number of beneficiaries.”

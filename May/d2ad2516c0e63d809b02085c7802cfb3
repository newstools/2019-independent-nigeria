Defender Connor Ogilvie has left Tottenham Hotspur to join League One side Gillingham on a two-year deal. The 23-year-old has been on loan at the Gills for the past two seasons and has become a regular in their first team, switching this season from his usual full-back role to play in the centre of the defence as the club finished 13th in the League One table. Ogilvie’s contract ended at Spurs next month and new Gillingham boss Steve Evans’ first act in charge was to tell the Gills’ chairman Paul Scally to get the deal done. “On Sunday, after accepting the job, I asked the chairman to contact Tottenham and earlier today he completed. We are delighted,” he said. “We have signed a player who can play higher, he wants to get better.” Connor Ogilvie
Scally added: “Connor is a warrior, a winner and an asset. It’s a great signing.” Despite successful loan spells in League One and Two with Gillingham and Stevenage, Ogilvie never managed to play a senior competitive match for Tottenham. His departure is expected to be the first in a clearout of some of the older players in Tottenham’s development squad.

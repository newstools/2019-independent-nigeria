Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Cheryl ‘s new single hints that she’s been left unimpressed by some of her selfish ex-lovers. The former Girls Aloud star is dropping Let You on Friday, but teased fans today by posting a clip online. The lyrics revealed in the 15-second Twitter clip hint at some underwhelming experiences in the bedroom. And after producer Naughty Boy – who’s been working with Cheryl on her new music – said the tracks were personal to Chezza, it could mean that she’s sending a message to her exes. Cheryl sings: “Let you put your hands on my body, every time. “I gave you what you wanted, but when am I gonna get mine?” Could she be referring to one of her exes? The 35-year-old was married to footballer Ashley Cole from 2006 to 2010, then tied the knot with restaurateur Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini in 2014, before being granted a decree nisi in 2016. That year, Chezza embarked on a romance with former One Direction star Liam Payne, 25. They welcomed son Bear together in 2017, then split the following year. Following their split, producer Naughty Boy – real name Shahid Khan – said Cheryl’s music was “100% personal” and would show fans her “vulnerable” side. “I think when you are writing songs there is a different vulnerability and that comes out through songwriting, so I am proud of her that she got more involved this time and not just as a singer. “The lyrics really mean something to her – sometimes you have to put a bit of heart for people to see that there is a real struggle.” The star went on to say that being a mum has “changed” Cheryl. Cheryl hasn’t released a song since last year’s Love Made Me Do It, which didn’t bring her as much success as she may have hoped.

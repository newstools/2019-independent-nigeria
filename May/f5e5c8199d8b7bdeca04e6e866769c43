Lagos – Odion Ighalo, Shanghai Greenland Shenhua of China striker, is in a race against time to be fit for Nigeria’s squad to this year’s Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), after copping an injury  on Friday. The AFCON 2019 is barely a month away, with Nigeria’s first match coming up on June 22 against Burundi, ahead of which the Super Eagles will open camp June 2 in Asaba, but Ighalo was carried off the pitch in his side’s 1-1 away draw to Tianjin Teda in the Chinese Super League (CSL). The AFCON 2019 offers a last opportunity of continental showpiece action for the ex-Julius Berger FC of Lagos, Prime FC of Osogbo, Lyn Oslo of Norway, Udinese of Italy, Granada of Spain, Watford of England and Changchun Yatai of China hitman, who has seven goals in nine league games for Shenhua this season. Ighalo, who is currently third highest scorer in the CSL, behind Graziano Pelle and Eran Zahavi, who have eight goals each, limped off in the 12th minute of the encounter at Tianjin Olympic Stadium, with his side already 1-0 down. According to reports, the 29-year-old striker, who topped the AFCON 2019 qualifiers’ goals’ chart with seven, now has just about three weeks to prove his fitness and report to Gernot Rohr’s camp in Asaba. We gathered that Ighalo, who has a total of 28 goals in 31 appearances for club and country since July 2018, will now hope for a positive result from tests he went for Friday night, as he will be eager to get back on his toes in order to make Rohr’s provisional roster for Egypt 2019, which is expected in the second week of June.

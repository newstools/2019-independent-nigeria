ABUJA – Dr. Dakuku Peterside, the Director General of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), on Tuesday said that Nigeria is largely seen as headquarters of piracy in the world. Peterside, who stated this in Abuja on Tuesday, during 2019 budget defence session of the agency before the Senate Committee on Marine Transport, however, added that the problem of the nation is more of maritime crime and not piracy which is committed on high seas. Responding to question on why NIMASA’s contributions into the Consolidated Revenue Fund in 2018 reduced by N6 billion when compared to the N22 billion remitted into the account in 2017, Peterside explained that maritime crime was largely responsible for the fall in revenues. While the agency remitted N22 billion into the consolidated revenue fund in 2017, in 2018 it was N16 billion, with a shortfall of N6 billion.

LAGOS – The Centre for Anti-Corruption and Open Leadership (CACOL) has lauded the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) for its commencement of investigations into the alleged illegal payment of about N400 million to some members of the Kwara State House of Assembly and the State Executive Council (SEC) members shortly before the expiration of their tenure. Mr. Debo Adeniran, CACOL’s Executive Chairman, in a statement issued by Kojeku Adebodun, the Centre’s Assistant Media and Publication Officer, lamented it had become a huge shame the manner at which fraud cases were being treated in the country. He lamented that people had refused to put a stop to their greedy ways of consuming what did not belong to them, and work adequately for their legal income, adding, “It is a shameful thing that this so-called fraud is common among those who claim to be representing us.” Adeniran wondered how corrupt individuals, who claim to be representing the people could authorise payment of such a huge amount of money at the tail end of the administration, “thereby violating basic rules which stipulate that such transaction ought to be carried out through the legal and due channel, claiming that the lawmakers are entitled to severance gratuity at the end of their tenure.

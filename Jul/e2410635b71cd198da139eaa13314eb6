One of the team’s sponsors, Captain Hosa Okunbo, rewarded the team with $20,000 for the win, while they got $5,000 each from they reportedly Lagos State Government. They also got a match-winning bonus of $12,500 and $75,000 for the three goals by one of the Nigeria Football Federation major sponsors, Aiteo Group.

Gernot Rohr’s side, however, rallied back to win the game with two second-half goals by Ighalo and Iwobi. The Super Eagles will face the Bafana Bafana of South Africa in the quarterfinals on Wednesday at the Cairo International Stadium. Kickoff is 8pm Nigerian time.

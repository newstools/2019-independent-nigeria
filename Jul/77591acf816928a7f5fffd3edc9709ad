Senate of the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH), Ogbomoso, has approved the withdrawal of certificate issued to one Akeju Oluwanisola Femi, a graduate of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, for refusing to appear before several panels raised to investigate his allegations of victimization against an unnamed lecturer in the Department of Pure and Applied Biology of the university.
The alumnus, who graduated in the 2013/2014 academic session with matriculation number 083659, had in a publication of March 15, 2018 on Naijaloaded, an online medium, claimed that a certain lecturer failed him in a particular biology course for six years.
All efforts made by different arms of the institution to enable Akeju shed more light on the allegations before various investigation panels yielded no fruit, as he refused entreaties made to him towards ensuring that he got redress and brought the said lecturer to book.
Other claims contained in his write-up included that he sat for BIO 101, 102, 104 and 106 and scored grade ‘A’ in all of the courses. Investigation into his academic record, however, indicated that Akeju Oluwanisola Femi registered for and passed BIO 101 (E), 102 (E), 103 (E) and did not register for BIO 104 in his first year in the university until the second semester of his extra year in 2013/2014 session and passed with ‘E’ grade.
Bothered by the negative effect of such allegations on the university’s profile and the fact that he had continued to fail to honour several invitations by the panels set up by the university, the authority has, therefore, decided that, all rights and privileges extended to Mr. Akeju Oluwanisola Femi as an alumnus of this university stood suspended.
Other sanctions approved by the university’s Senate were that, issuance of academic transcript to him was suspended forthwith; the statement of results issued by the university to Mr. Akeju Oluwanisola Femi be immediately invalidated, and that his academic certificate be withheld until further notice

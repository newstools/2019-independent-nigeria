In continuation of its reputation as Nigeria’s prime promoter of culture and tradition, the grandmaster of data, Globacom, has through its latest Television Commercial (TVC) tagged “Glo Amebo”, revived one of the nation’s literary icons, Chief Ibidun Alison, who played the role of the village chatter box in the classic television sitcom, the Village Headmaster. Viewers of the sitcom which dominated the Nigerian television space from the 1958 to 1988, will easily recall the chatting dexterity of one of the protagonists of the Village Headmaster, Madam Amebo, whose penchant for talkativeness and meddlesomeness birthed the metaphor, ‘amebo’, a street lingo for “busybodies.” The new offer, “Glo Amebo” gives subscribers five
times the value of their recharge, such that subscribers can talk more without bothering about the cost as the additional values are sufficient to take care of the bills. In the “Glo Amebo” TVC, Chief (Mrs.) Ibidun Allison, in a reminiscent way, played the role of a talkative beads seller. The TVC begins with Chief Allison (Amebo) initiating a call with her daughter performed by creative Yvonne Jegede in the morning and she was on the call throughout the day till the evening without realising that other shop owners had closed. To underscore the near unlimited call time the “Glo Amebo” offers, when one of the customers, acted by Ego Ogbaru, complained about the unending call, Amebo retorted, “Na you be Glo wey dey dash me credit anyhow?”

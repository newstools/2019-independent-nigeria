ABUJA – Hajj missions from various countries of the world on July 18, converged on the city of Madinah in Saudi Arabia to attend a meeting called by Sheikh Abdul Rahman Bn AbdulAzeez Al Sudais, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the two holy mosques. A statement issued by the Head Media and Public Affairs of the National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON), Fatima Sanda Usara on Wednesday, said the Sheikh appealed to the Hajj missions to guide their pilgrims to remain focused on acts of worship. Sheikh Sudais said the art of worship remained the main reason of their visit to the Kingdom, stressing that pilgrims should not be involved in any form of political activity while in the kingdom. He reaffirmed that the Kingdom gives equal opportunity to all Muslims to perform Hajj once the persons are compliant to Saudi rules and regulations that are normally sourced from Islamic shari’a. The learned Sheikh called upon all pilgrims to regard the supremacy of Saudi aligned school of thought once in the Holy land. He said rulings under the Saudi supported school of thought takes precedence on general activities over those of other countries or individuals while in the Kingdom.

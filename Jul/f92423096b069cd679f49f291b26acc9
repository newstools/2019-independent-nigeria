The Bauchi State chapter of the People’s Redemption Party (PRP) has lamented that 19 constituencies of the state House of Assembly do not have representation following the manner in which the inauguration of the legislators was conducted last month where only 11 out of 31 members were sworn in. This was contained in a release to journalists Tuesday by the State chairman of the party, Alhaji Shehu Barau Ningi and Secretary, Comrade Muhammed Bello Ishaq. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network They said the party aligns itself with the recommendations of the House of Representatives Ad-hoc Committee to investigate the crisis surrounding the inauguration of the 9th State Assembly which urged the state Governor Bala Mohammed to withdraw the letter of proclamation of June 17, 2019 and June 20, 2019 and reissue a new proclamation letter for fresh inauguration. “We equally wish to call on the Governor of Bauchi State, His Excellency, Senator Bala Abdulkadir Mohammed, to tow the path of honour and remember that the people of Bauchi State had massively voted for him during the 2019 Gubernatorial Election without recourse to partisan consideration to salvage them from the mis-governance of the last administration,” they said. The party also demanded for a declaration from the Bauchi State government on the issue of the size of the state workforce and the total expenditure on their monthly salaries so as to dispel the rumours going round pointing different figures allegedly spent by the current administration. The party finally congratulated the governor on his recent wedding, promising that they are committed to working with the government in building the state where rule of law is upheld and wrong deeds are rejected.

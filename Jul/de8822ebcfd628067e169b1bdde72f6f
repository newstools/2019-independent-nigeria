LAGOS – Contrary to views that Egyptian soccer fans will support the Super Eagles against the Bafana Bafana of South Africa in their quarterfinal match today, ex-international Taiwo Oloyede, has urged the Nigerians to go all out and play to win instead of relying on the support of the Egyptian fans. The insinuation is that the Egyptian fans are angry that South Africa beat their team, and they are now ready to pay Bafana Bafana back by supporting the Super Eagles to victory. The Egyptians believe that Nigeria has a better chance of going all the way to the trophy than South Africa does, hence their decision to root for the Super Eagles all the way this time. “As an ex-international, I believe so much in team work, determination and the will to excel with less emphasis on crowd supports. “Support is very good and at times it goes a long way in aiding a team to success but the major task is on the principal actors on the field, the players. “The Egyptian fans supported their team against the same South Africa that Nigeria will be playing on Wednesday (today) and still lost. “So for me, they should forget about the support but should go out there and play very well with the view and determination to win and move to the next stage of the tournament. “Determination will see them through and that is the only time when they will appreciate the support of the fans, but first, they must be ready to play well to win”, said Oloyede.

LAGOS – Odion Ighalo, Shanghai Shenhua of China striker, has vowed to overcome his injury woes , saying that he has no regrets playing for the Super Eagles at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Egypt. The 2019 AFCON top scorer stressed that he always wanted to give his best to the team, from which he retired last week. Although, he cited threats to his life and family among reasons for his early international retirement, Ighalo added that the injury he copped in the third place match against Tunisia had nothing to do with his decision, as he acknowledged that it was also part of the game. He took to social media to reveal his worries over the injury, but said that it does not mean he regreted playing at AFCON 2019, noting that he was determined to get back into action very soon, in order to make his club’s fans happy once again. “This is the most difficult season in my club career but playing for my country has always been a dream and this is the last big tournament in my international career. “I’m so unlucky to have got the same injury and especially this period that my team needs me. “I feel so sorry for the fans that I will be missing some games but I will work hard to be back ASAP to end the season very well,” Ighalo posted. It would be recalled that Ighalo was injured late in the first half of the third place match after scoring the only goal that earned the Super Eagles the third place position at the AFCON 2019 and made him the top scorer with five goals. According to medical reports, the injury will see Ighalo stay out on the sidelines for eight weeks, but the 30-year-old attacker insists he has no regrets. Instead of blaming the Super Eagles for the hamstring injury on the national team, Ighalo admitted he has been unlucky with such setbacks in recent months, but vowed to fight back and get over his latest blight as he had notched a total 16 goals in 35 matches for Nigeria.

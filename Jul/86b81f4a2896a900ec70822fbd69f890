Nwogu and Emeka Ejike are cooling off in police net after they were arrested alongside one Emmanuel Sunday for kidnapping their 88-year-old father, Louis Njoku. Emmanuel said to be Chinaza’s boyfriend, had planned using his cut from the ransom that will be paid for the abduction of his would-be father-in-law to pay for his daughter’s bride price. Parading the suspects, the Force Public Relations Officer, Frank Mba said the suspects were arrested by operatives of the Anti-Kidnapping Unit of the Imo state command on June 29 following a tip-off. “A pathetic development is that of two siblings, who teamed up with the would-be husband of one of them to abduct their 88-year-old father. Chinaza, who wants to get married to Emmanuel, teamed up with her brother, Emeka, to kidnap their father, who is an octogenarian, in what I call a triangular crime arrangement. “The suspects were arrested by the operatives of the Anti-Kidnapping Unit of the command on June 29 following a tip-off in connection with the kidnap of the victim. The suspects, who specialise in kidnapping people for ransom in Mbaise and its environs, have made useful statements to the police and confessed to the crime. They also narrated the various roles they played in the kidnap operation” Mba said.

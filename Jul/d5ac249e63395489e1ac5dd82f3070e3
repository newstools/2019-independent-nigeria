ABUJA – Department of Outdoor Advertisement and Signage (DOAS) on Thursday revealed that the agency had lost N18 billion in six years from outdoor advertisement and signage.
Mr Babagana Adam, Director, FCT DOAS, disclosed this known in an interview with newsmen immediately after a meeting with the Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC) chairman on how to synergise to stop the leakages by centralising and controlling advertisements in Abuja
According to him, “We have lost about N3 billion each year and when you multiple that N3 billion by six years, N18 billion have been lost. Imagine how many schools, roads, poultry farms, livestock farms, ICT centres, library that would have been built with this money. So, we have lost quite a lot of money.
“We have lost about N18 billion in six years. With this new development now, I don’t want to look at what we are losing. I will rather love that we strategise and synergise to put a stop to the money leakages.” Earlier, Alhaji Abdullahi Candido, Chairman, Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC), said the collaboration by the two organs of the government, FCTA and AMAC, was overdue to use the available resources to provide services to the people. According to him, in the last three years, it had not been too good, “because we all lost out, the reasons why we must collaborate and have a new beginning to cement the relationship. We must harmonise to stop double payment by the clients.”

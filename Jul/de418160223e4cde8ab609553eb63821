Teams from across Europe took part in a ‘transfer speed dating’ event hosted at Stamford Bridge, According to Dailymail.co.uk. There were 100 directors from the likes of Manchester City, Juventus and Roma in attendance with chairs laid out in a similar manner to a speed dating function. The idea was to facilitate networking and allow the top brass at clubs to seal deals in a straightforward way. This event was for one day and included representatives from as far afield as the MLS. Some opted to show footage of players on laptops and others took the opportunity to swap business cards with new contacts. Each conversation between directors would last only 15 minutes and then the pair would have to go their separate ways to meet a new executive. Anderlecht technical director Frank Arnesen spoke to Sky Sports about what he makes of Chelsea’s transfer activity amid their ban. He said: ‘Obviously it is not easy, but on the other hand some young players on loan have done well. [Tammy] Abraham and so on. So I don’t see it as only negative. I think Frank [Lampard] will put a very good squad together and they will challenge again for the championship.’ The day was organised by Transfer Room and those taking part have to pay a year-long subscription fee to take part. So far it has found plenty of success and roughly 200 transfer deals have been made to this point, with more expected to follow. The concept appears to have struck a chord at a number of clubs and the next event is to take place in Madrid this August.

ADO-EKITI – The People’s Party of Nigeria (PPN) has vowed to dislodge the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2020 governorship election in Edo State. A gubernatorial aspirant of the PPN, Darlington Iyoha, said Governor Godwin Obaseki was no match for him in the all-important contest. Iyoha, who had unveiled his intention to contest on the platform of the People’s Party of Nigeria (PPN), said these in a statement made available to journalists in Ado-Ekiti on Friday. The gubernatorial
aspirant said he was astounded that Edo citizens had been made to suffer due to lack of commitment and innovations by the past and present chief executives, in spite of the humongous resources accruing to it. Iyoha said his resolve to oust Obaseki was borne out of the passion to usher in good governance that will bring democracy dividends to the suffering masses of Edo State. He lamented that good governance had eluded the state since the advent of democracy in 1999, saying he has decided to plunge into the race to change the narratives and restore participatory and beneficial governance to Edo State.

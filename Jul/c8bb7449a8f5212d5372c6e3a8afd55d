Bauchi – Bappa Aliyu, a senatorial candidate of the Peoples Redemption Party (PRP) for Bauchi Central in the 2019 election, has presented evidences on the alleged falsification of certificates suit he instituted against Senator Halliru Dauda Jika of the All Progressive Congress (APC) who defeated him at the last poll.
Counsel to the PRP candidate, Marcel Oru, who presented the evidences before the National Assembly election petition tribunal sitting in Bauchi, said that with the evidences so far tendered by them, they had closed the case and await judgement.
“The petitioner has tendered his evidences and called witnesses. Our case is simple; Halliru Dauda Jika is not qualified to contest in the first place as a senator. He has presented false documents to INEC in 2018 for the February 2019 election. That is a disqualifying factor.
“The expectation is that the tribunal will do its work and at the end we pray that justice shall be done,” he said.
Meanwhile, counsel to Jika, Kenechukwu Azi, said they disputed the documents tendered by the petitioner as evidences.
He said they would present their defense in the next adjourned date as the plaintiff exhausted all their evidences and closed the case.
However, chairman of the tribunal, Hafsa Abdulrahman, who entertained the case, adjourned sitting to Tuesday for the first respondent to open his defense.

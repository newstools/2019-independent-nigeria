BAUCHI – The Bauchi State government has warned the Na­tional Publici­ty Secretary of the All Progressive Congress (APC), Mr Lanre Issa Onilu, to stop meddling in the affairs of the state House of Assem­bly, saying that he was acting out the script of APC National Chair­man, Mr Adams Osh­iomhole. According to a press statement by the spokesman of Gov­ernor, Dr Ladan Sali­hu, which was made available to newsmen in Bauchi on Tuesday, the state government said it attention had been drawn to a state­ment credited to Onilu in which he stated that there must be a proper proclamation of the Houses of Assembly in Bauchi and Edo states and that the rule of im­punity in the affected states must stop. The government faulted the statement by the APC chieftain, pointing out that it was embarrassing that an official of his calibre missed out completely on the facts of the mat­ter. “A constitutional proclamation was is­sued by his Excellency, the executive Governor, Bala Abdulkadir Mo­hammed, on the 20th of June 2019 in exercise of his power under section 3 subsection 105 of the 1999 Constitution of Ni­geria. “Out of the 13 mem­bers who formed a quorum, only 11 were required by the law. Elections to the lead­ership of the House of Assembly were held in accordance with the laid down proce­dures,” the statement read. It further stated that Onilu should be the last to speak about ar­bitrariness when his boss remained the pro­ponent and champion of impunity.

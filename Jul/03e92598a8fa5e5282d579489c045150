This theme for this year is “Health for Justice, Justice for Health.” Speaking on the danger of drug abuse, Ajileye called on parents to stand up to their responsibility by taking proper care of their children. According to her, “Charity begins at home, hence it is time for parents and guardians to start monitoring their children’s behavior and become more sensitive to their children’s welfare.” Ajileye said that teachers and lecturers are not left out in the fight against the menace as they are also custodians of these adolescents who may be influenced by peer pressure in schools.

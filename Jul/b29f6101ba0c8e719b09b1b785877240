Bauchi – Faruk Mustapha, the New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP) senatorial candidate for Bauchi North in the 2019 election, has presented evidences in the suit filed against the victory of Adamu Bulkachuwa of the All Progressives Congress (APC) before the National Assembly Petition Tribunal sitting in Bauchi. It would be recall that Mustapha dragged Bulkachuwa, the returning officer of the Bauchi North senatorial election, the state Resident Electoral Commissioner and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to the tribunal over alleged manipulation of the election result. He claimed that he was the lawful winner of the election having allegedly scored the highest number of votes at the 1,419 polling units in the seven local governments of the zone but was allegedly awarded 92,000 votes while his opponent that was declared winner was allegedly allocated 110, 000 votes by INEC. During the last sitting, counsel to Mustapha, Joe Dappa, presented electoral documents that included results allegedly declared at all polling units in the seven local governments of the constituency, card reader printout reports, candidates’ list for Senate and voter registers, among others. While counsel to the defendant, Adamu Bulkachuwa, led by Raphael Adekola, said they reserved their objection to the exhibits presented until after the completion of presentation of all the petitioner’s evidence. Meanwhile the chairperson of the tribunal, Hafsat Abdulrahman, adjourned sitting to July 16 and 17 2019.

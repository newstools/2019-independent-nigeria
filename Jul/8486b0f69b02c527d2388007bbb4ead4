Ukraine will include the means spent on compensations for destroyed houses in Donbas in a consolidated claim for Russia. Therefore, Russia will be obliged to pay for the means spent on compensations. The decision was made on July 10, as Ministry of Temporarily Occupied Territories reported. Ukrainians will get compensation for destroyed houses and apartments. The payout will be set in an individual order, it will depend on housing cost. The local authority bodies, military and civil administrations have to inspect the destroyed houses. Then, they have to issue respective acts to the owners. The victims have to submit the documents, acts and statements to special commissions of region state administrations. It should be noted that the Ministry of Temporarily Occupied Territories has not developed forms of the required documents and has not confirmed the order of statements consideration. On December 10, 2018 ex-President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko urged the Cabinet of Ministers to create an inter-ministerial coordination body to make claim against Russia.

Manchester United have been asked to be kept informed over the future of Tottenham’s Christian Eriksen as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer aims to boost their midfield creativity next season. Eriksen, 27, could be allowed to leave Spurs for £70million this summer with the Dane showing little interest in extending a deal that has just a year to run. Spanish giants Barcelona, Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid have been heavily linked with the player but with their money spent elsewhere, United are emerging as genuine contenders and could be given the green light to bid once Spurs complete the signing of Giovani Lo Celso from Betis. United are aware they could lose Paul Pogba in this window – that deal is dependent on Real Madrid selling Gareth Bale to match United’s £150million asking price – but regardless of the Frenchman’s future, Solskjaer is keen to add craft to the pace and energy he’s already got in the squad. United, who are still being frustrated in attempts to sign defender Harry Maguire from Leicester, have looked at a number of midfield players including Sergej Milinkovic-Savic of Lazio, but Eriksen is proven in the Premier League. He signed for Tottenham from Ajax in 2013 and became the most successful of the acquisitions funded by Bale’s departure to Madrid.

Friday at her weekly press briefing on Capitol Hill, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said the House of Representatives is investigating President Donald Trump’s “finances, personal business” in their next step toward possible impeachment.
When asked about running out the clock on impeachment, Pelosi said, “I’m not trying to run out the clock. Let’s get sophisticated about this, OK? We’ll proceed when we have what we need to proceed. Not one day sooner. And everybody has the liberty and luxury to espouse their own position and to criticize me for trying to go down the path in the most determined, positive way. Again, their advocacy for impeach only gives me leverage. I have no complaints with what they are doing.” “But I know I keep calling him special counsel Mueller,” she continued. “Mr. Mueller said the other day, confirmed, confirmed in the public mind that the president has obstructed justice. You know what he said, if he could have exonerated him, he would have, but he didn’t. He was not able to investigate the president’s finances, personal business, or otherwise, that’s what we are doing courts. So I’m willing to take whatever heat there is there to say when the decision will be made in a timely fashion. This isn’t endless. When we have the best, strongest possible case.”

LAGOS – As the industrial action embarked upon by the Maritime Workers Union of Nigeria (MWUN) entered the second day on Thursday, commercial activities at the seaports still remained stagnant as Nigerian ports are still shut down.
Sources at the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) revealed that the authority was getting worried due to the huge losses the crisis was costing the nation.
The strike, according to sources, would have made much sense if the striking workers union had barricaded the multinational oil companies which refused to pay the workers’ wages.
It would be recalled that the leadership of the Maritime Workers Union had issued a two- week ultimatum to the International Oil Companies (IOC) to pay up workers’ wages through the stevedoring companies, but the IOC’s did not comply.
According to our source, “The major problem here are the big 5 oil companies, including Chevron and others; what the union ought to have done is not to shut the port, they are supposed to close down the premises of the oil companies.
“But everybody believes that shutting down the port is what will give them attention.
“The NPA is in support of the workers but now we are being affected because our ports are now being shut down and this would affect the revenue.
“The meeting continues tomorrow (Today) because the IOC and the workers could not reach an agreement.”
The meeting, it was learnt, deadlocked as both parties could not reach a formal agreement on the payment of all outstanding entitlements being owed the labour workers by the IOC’s.
Adewale Adeyanju, the president general of union, told newsmen that no headway was reached at the meeting due to the uncompromising stance of both parties.
The MWUN leader insisted that the meeting failed to yield positive result thus the strike will continue.

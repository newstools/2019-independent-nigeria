The children were among 14 civilians killed in attacks in northwestern Syria, a UK-based activist group says Syrian regime bombardment has killed 14 civilians, including seven children, in northwestern Syria, a UK-based activist group said on Saturday, in the latest deadly raids on the embattled opposition bastion. Warplanes and helicopters late on Friday carried out air strikes on Mahambel village in Idlib province, killing 13 civilians, including the children, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. A woman was also killed early on Saturday by regime rocket fire on the outskirts of the town of Khan Sheikhun, in the south of the province, the Observatory said. As the last stronghold of rebels against President Bashar al-Assad’s rule, Idlib has been the focus of a government offensive since late April. The province, which borders Turkey, was supposed to be protected by a deal struck between Ankara and Assad’s backers in Moscow, but has instead been subjected to heavy bombardment during the ongoing campaign. An average of two children have been killed in Idlib every day, according to the estimate of another activist group, the Syrian Network for Human Rights. The group said 518 people were killed in a two-month period from the end of April.

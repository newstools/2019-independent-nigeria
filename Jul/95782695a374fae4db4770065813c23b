Blackpool can confirm the signing of Jak Alnwick on a season-long loan from Rangers, subject to international clearance. The stopper, 26, becomes the seventh new face to arrive at the club this summer and strengthens a goalkeeping department that is currently without the services of Mark Howard due to injury. Alnwick, who started his senior career with Newcastle United, moved to Rangers for an undisclosed fee in 2017 following an impressive 18-month spell between the sticks for Port Vale, where he played 79 games and kept 23 clean sheets. He has since made 11 first-team appearances for Rangers and spent last season on loan in Sky Bet League One with Scunthorpe United, featuring 43 times. On joining, Jak Alnwick said: “I’m delighted to be here and delighted to be a part of what’s going to be with the club moving forward. When you come to top clubs, you’re always going to have to compete for your place and that’s what I’m going to do. I’ll give everything I’ve got and hopefully play as many games as I can.” Manager Simon Grayson added: “With Mark Howard continuing to recover from injury, we felt it was important to bring in another senior goalkeeper to add competition for places. Jak is very experienced at this level and we’re looking forward to working with him.”

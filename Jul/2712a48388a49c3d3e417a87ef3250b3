Lagos – Unheralded goalkeeper, Darlington Ovunda was the unlikely hero for Rivers United as the ‘Pride of Rivers’ defeated Lobi Stars 5-3 on penalty shoot outs to reach the semifinals of Nigeria’s oldest  football competition, the Federation Cup. Ovunda saved once and converted the decisive kick in the shootout as United put themselves within striking distance of the showpiece game. The quarter final decided at the Dipo Dina Stadium, Ijebu-Ode was one of few clear cut goal scoring opportunities so it was unsurprising that the stand out moment in regulation time was an extraordinary save by United goalkeeper, Abiodun Akande to keep out Kadiri Timileyin’s goal bound effort in the 79th minute. In another quarterfinal match played, Kano Pillars bashed Aklosendi FC 4-0 to reach the semifinal while Calabar Rovers edged out Bendel Insurance 5-4 on penalty kicks after the match ended goalless at regulation time. Niger Tornadoes on the other hand also went through the penalty kicks to send out Lagos State champions, Smart City FC. The match had ended goalless but Tornadoes triumphed penalty kicks 5-4 to book their semifinal match. While Kano Pillars will engage Calabar Rovers, Rivers United of Port Harcourt will now meet Niger Tornadoes in the last four of the competition.

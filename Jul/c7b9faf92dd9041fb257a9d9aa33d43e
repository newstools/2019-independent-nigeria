Bauchi – Chieftains of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Bauchi State have appealed to members and leaders to remain loyal to the party, assuring that the immediate past governor of the state Mohammed Abubakar will soon reclaim his stolen mandate at election petition tribunal.
The Bogoro Local Government chairman of the party, Malam Haruna Rikaya, made the appeal on Monday at the end of a meeting with party chieftains and stakeholders in the local government.
He explained that the meeting was aimed at strengthening the party in the area despite it purported defeat in the last 2019 elections, vowing that even if they lose in court, the party will bounce back in the next election.
According to him, the present Governor Bala Mohammed has an inauspicious start when he spent about two months in leadership without allegedly commencing any works in spite of the over N20 billion left behind by the ex-governor in the state treasury.
Rikaya alleged that Governor Bala failed to redeem the promises he made during electioneering such as the payment of gratuities to retirees, leave grants for workers immediately after assuming office but only flagged off projects without commencement.
The party chairman also alleged that the governor revoked contracts awarded by his predecessor decrying that the action could hamper their completion and development of the state.
Another APC chieftain in the state and former Senior Special Assistant on security to the ex-governor Michael Damina said despite being rigged out by the PDP, the APC remains intact as none of its chieftains stepped out.
“We are solidly bound together and will continue to pursue everything that belongs to APC. We want to tell the world that we have not seen the issue of division in the party.” “We are with the APC leadership in Bauchi State, our former governor who will soon come back, the president of Nigeria and all the stakeholders at the national, state and local governments level,” he said.

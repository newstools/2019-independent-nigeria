Association of Advertising Agencies of Nigeria (AAAN) has rescheduled its 46th Annual General Meeting (AGM)/Congress scheduled to hold between Thursday July 11 and Saturday July 13 in Asaba, the Delta State capital.
This decision to reschedule the programme was reached, following a near-plane crash experienced by members of the association travelling to Asaba.
The flight, operated by Air Peace Airlines, had on board over 40 members of the association, including industry leaders, when it took off from Lagos on Thursday, but could not land at the Asaba Airport due to the weather and other logistic issues, compelling a return to Lagos.
The airline subsequently cancelled flight operations to Asaba on Thursday.
Ikechi Odigbo, AAAN President, stated that more than half of the expected delegates were on the flight, adding that the postponement of the AGM/Congress was unavoidable because the associationâ€™s constitution stipulated that two-thirds of members must be present for an AGM to hold.
He stressed that the members had been traumatised by their experience during the aborted flight, adding that the new date and venue for the AGM/Congress would be communicated.

Lagos – Madagascar continue their giant-killing performance at the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations with a 4-2 penalty win over the Democratic Republic of Congo on Sunday. The debutants thus qualified for the quarter final. Amada fired Madagascar into the lead from a great team move by the Malagasy on the near side as Andriatsima held on to the ball and allowed his teammates to penetrate the Congo DR defence. The ball eventually fell to Amada who unleashed a rocket into the top corner. Cedric Bakambu drew Congo DR level with a close-range attempt after getting behind the Madagascar box. The result remained like that after the break. But Madagascar restored their lead as Andriatsima headed his team in front from a cross in the 70th minute. But Mbemba’s towering header hit the back of the net as Congo DR surely took the game into extra time in the 90th minute. In the ensuing penalty kick, Congo DR missed two of their kicks as the debutants triumphed 4-2.

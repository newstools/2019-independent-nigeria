Manchester City may have lost to Wolves in their second pre-season game, but there were plenty of positives to take from the game for Pep Guardiola, According to Manchestereveningnews.co.uk. “We would prefer to win and lift the trophy,” Guardiola said. “But at the end we have to look at the performance. With the ball, without the ball, how quick we play.” City fielded a much stronger team than the side that beat West Ham last time out, with Kevin de Bruyne, Raheem Sterling and Leroy Sane all starting. But a resilient Wolves defence and missed penalty from Sterling meant the scores were level after 90 minutes. It was Wolves who were victorious on penalties, and Guardiola’s philosophical outlook after the game indicated that he was happy with the afternoon’s work. In particular, Guardiola highlighted De Bruyne’s contribution, after the Belgian’s frustrating campaign last season. If anything, however, De Bruyne is clearly back with a point to prove and has been a stand-out performer in both pre-season matches so far. Against Wolves, one moment in particular impressed City fans, as he flicked up a loose ball in the centre circle and volleyed an arrowed pass to Leroy Sane on the left wing to start an attack. Safe to say, fans were quick to drool over their returning playmaker, who could be like a new signing this season.

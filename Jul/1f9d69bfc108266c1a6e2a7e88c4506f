Rafa Benitez wants former striker Salomon Rondon to follow him to China, According to Dailymail.co.uk. Rondon scored 12 times for Benitez at Newcastle United last season during a successful loan spell from West Brom – and now the Spaniard is seeking to take him to new club Dalian Yifang. Championship side Albion can’t afford to keep 29-year-old Rondon and are willing to strike a deal with Dalian whose financial power gives them an advantage over West Ham and Newcastle in signing the Venezuelan. The much-travelled Rondon played in Spain and Russia before coming to the Premier League in 2015 with West Brom. Benitez will earn an estimated £12million a year in China after his contract ran out at St James’ Park and views Rondon as the perfect centre-forward to build his team around. Rondon’s Venezuela crashed out of the Copa America last week at the quarter-final stage, falling to a 2-0 defeat by Argentina at the Maracana Stadium.

The 54-year-old TV star has taken to Twitter to pay a glowing tribute to the so-called super-agent, whose client list also included the likes of Mark Wright, Peter Andre, and Gemma Collins. He wrote on the micro-blogging platform: “RIP John Ferriter, 59. My brilliant manager and ferociously loyal, kind, charismatic & supremely talented friend. “I trusted him with my life, and he enriched my life so much. “Thank you John, for everything you did for me, and for my family. (sic)”
Susanna Reid, who is Piers’ co-host on ‘Good Morning Britain’, also took to social media to praise Ferriter, describing him as “determined and great company”.
She wrote: “So sad. I knew John briefly but long enough to know he was loyal, determined and great company. Devastating news.
“Hard to believe. Huge love to all of John’s family and friends. (sic)”
Meanwhile, Peter Andre recently backed Ferriter to make him a star in the US, saying he took confidence from what he’d done for Piers and Mark Wright.
He said: “He’s done wonders for Piers on the shows in America. He’s done jobs with Mark Wright, and all the gigs Mark’s done in America. So I really am in good hands.
“We have actually talked about doing TV work so, you know, it is one of the main focuses as well as film.
“I like what John has done with Piers worldwide. He’s done some amazing shows.”

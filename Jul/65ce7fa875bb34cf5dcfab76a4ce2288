Yenagoa – The Bayelsa State House of Assembly, at the weekend, screened and confirmed Victor Okubonanabo as the new Executive Secretary of the state Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) following his appointment by Governor Seriake Dickson.
Okubonanabo replaces Walton Liverpool who was last week sacked by the governor on the recommendations of the Assembly for allegedly running the board like a sole administrator and awarding contracts without due process.
Liverpool, an in-law of Dickson, was appointed Executive Secretary of the SUBEB in 2012 when the governor, upon assuming office, probed the operations of the board which led to the removal of the then boss, Rhodesia Whyte.
In 2014, the 5th state Assembly investigated the activities of SUBEB under Liverpool during which aggrieved members of the board took him to the cleaners.
They accused him of operating the board as his personal estate and using his relationship with the governor to intimidate members of the board.
Despite the startling revelations at the panel which indicted Liverpool who denied the allegations, the governor retained and re-appointed him after his re-election in 2016.
However, Dickson, shortly after relieving Liverpool of his appointment, forwarded the name of Pius Jonah, a Commissioner for Special Duties, as replacement to the legislators for screening and confirmation, a development the Assembly acknowledged last Thursday.
But there was a twist during plenary at the weekend when Okubonanabo, instead of Jonah, appeared before the lawmakers and he was screened and confirmed as the substantive secretary of the board.
The new SUBEB boss is believed to be a close confidant of Dickson and he also comes from the same Toru-Orua community in Sagbama Local Government Area as the governor.
He told journalists in an interview after his confirmation that he would work together with members of the board as a team to ensure progress in primary education across Bayelsa.

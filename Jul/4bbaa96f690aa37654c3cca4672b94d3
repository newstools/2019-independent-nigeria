OSOGBO – Dr. Olapade Agoro, former Presidential Candidate of National Action Council, has warned leadership of the Yoruba socio-cultural group, Afenifere, and others not to use the murder of Afenifere Leader’s daughter, Mrs. Funke Olakunrin, to set Nigeria ablaze. Agoro gave the warning while speaking with DAILY INDEPENDENT on phone over the killing. He explained that the killing of Afenifere leader’s daughter was not enough reason to put the whole country on fir, admomishing police and other security agencies in the country to step up intelligence gathering and ensure that the culprits are brought to book.
The party chieftain also called on security operatives to carry out thorough investigation to fish out Olakunrin’s killers to save the country from impending crisis. He further cautioned opinion leaders, “specifically Yinka Odumakin of the Afenifere and Ango Abdullahi” against making inflammatory statements capable of setting the country ablaze on the gruesome murder of the Afenifere leader’s daughter. He said police should be allowed to carry out investigation to unravel the criminal elements behind the killing, rather than jumping into hasty conclusion that the dastardly act was carried out by Fulani herdsmen. He said, “One cannot reasonably rule out the possibility of armed robbers or hired assassins being behind Olakunrin’s killing.

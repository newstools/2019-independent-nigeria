ABUJA – Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, the Deputy President, on Tuesday called for the removal of oil subsidy, saying that there is no need for Nigeria to continue with the regime. Omo-Agege, in a statement by Yomi Odunuga, his Special Adviser, Media and Publicity, said all that was needed to address the lingering issue of inadequate refined oil production to match local consumption, was to fix the country’s ailing refineries. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Omo-Agege expressed surprise that in spite of obvious economic realities, some people within and outside the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) still continued to believe that subsidy was the solution. He also expressed dismay over the insistence of some multinational oil companies operating in the Niger Delta region on moving their headquarters elsewhere, with attendant job losses. Demanding their relocation to the region, Omo-Agege said, “I have always taken the position that there is no need for us to continue with this subsidy; all we need to do is to fix the refineries. “But, today, I have seen many people in the NNPC and elsewhere moving otherwise because they believe we ought to continue with this subsidy regime. “I am from the Niger Delta and there are a lot of us who believe that most of the oil companies are doing business in that neighborhood ought to have their offices and their headquarters in that same neighborhood so as to provide employment opportunities “There is an issue that is raging right now in the Niger Delta and it has to do with the Nigerian Gas Company in Ekpan-Warri; they are also threatening to move their headquarters from Warri in Delta state to elsewhere. “I am seeking a commitment today as the representative of the people of Delta Central that no ministerial nominee today will eventually superintend over the movement of Nigerian Gas Company elsewhere. “I also seek a commitment that those companies that are doing business in the Niger Delta, but have their headquarters elsewhere should come back to the Niger Delta area to provide jobs for our teeming youths.”

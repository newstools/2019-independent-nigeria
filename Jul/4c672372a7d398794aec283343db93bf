LAGOS – Daniel Igali, President of the Nigeria Wrestling Federation (NWF) has showered accolades on the female duo of Adekuoroye Odunayo and Blessing Oborududu for their exploits at the just concluded 2019 Yaşar Doğu World Wrestling Championship in Istanbul, Turkey. Igali said he was happy that both grapplers excelled at the events, with performances that have added to their total haul of international points and qualifies them for further global championships and the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan. He said he was excited seeing Oborodudu beat Ukraine’s Alina Berezhna Makhynia 10-0 to clinch the bronze medal in the 68kg category, while Adekuoroye won gold in 57kg, after beating another Ukrainian opponent, Tetyana Kit 10-0. Adekuoroye had earlier displayed her intentions to pull in huge points, as the World Championship silver medalist defeated the 2015 bronze medalist and 2016 European championships silver medalist in the gold medal match at Bacılar Olimpic Sports Hall on Saturday. She began in Turkey by defeating Giullia Rodrigues Penalber De Oliveira of Brazil 15-2 in the contest’s round of 16, then beat Lissette Alexandra Antes Castillo of Ecuador 10-0 in the quarter final before recording a 6-3 victory over Olga Khoroshavtseva of Russia in the semi-final. With the win, Adekuoroye, who earlier won the German World Ranking series and placed third at the Bulgarian ranking tournament in early 2019, is expected to be ranked in the top-three in her weight class. Oborududu will also be placed in the top eight having won two bronze medals in Germany and Istanbul this year, as the nine-time African top female and current Commonwealth champion proved why she is rated 12th by first beating Germany’s Nadine Weinauge 12-3 in the qualifiers before overcoming Kadriye Aksoy of Turkey 6-0 in the quarter final. The performances of Adekuoroye and Oborududu left Igali beaming with satisfaction after the four-day championship, which had more than 275 wrestlers from 21 countries aiming for ranking points before heading to Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan for September’s World Championships.

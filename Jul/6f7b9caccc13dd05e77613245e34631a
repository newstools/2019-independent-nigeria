ASABA – Chief James Augoye, Del­ta State Commissioner for Works, has reiterated the state government commit­ment to construct roads that would stand the test of time. Augoye stated this in Asa­ba during a meeting with the ministry’s field engineers in the 25 local government ar­eas of the state. The Commissioner, who stated that the meeting was to intimate the engineers about the new directives and policies regarding con­struction of road projects in the state, stated that field engineers must ensure that contractors discharged their responsibility according to job specification. He stated that Governor Ifeanyi Okowa administra­tion wanted to leave behind legacy road projects that would stand the test of time, saying that it would be a di­saster after handover and roads started to fail after the first rain. According to Augoye, “You must know the new pol­icy direction of government as people who supervise road projects and be conver­sant with what the ministry and government want to do in this second tenure. “You must understand that all concrete works in­cluding box culvert must now be done with grade 35 concrete. If you don’t know grade 35 concrete as speci­fied by the Federal Ministry of Work, how will you be able to supervise such proj­ect,” Augoye stated. The Commissioner, who solicited the support and co­operation of the engineers in delivering quality road projects to Deltans, warned the engineers against collect­ing bribes from contractors to allow them to do shoddy jobs. He said, “You will not only be redeployed to the head­quarters but will be made to face disciplinary measure to serve as deterrent to others. You did very well in the first tenure of Governor Okowa, try as much as possible to surpass it and do not en­courage contractors to cut corners.”

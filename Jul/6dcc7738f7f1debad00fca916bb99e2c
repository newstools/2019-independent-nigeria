To help curb the increasing incidence of medical tourism, the Nigeria Institute of Pharmaceutical Research and Development (NIPRD) says it is making efforts to ensure that Nigerian medical practitioners return to the country after training abroad. Dr. Obi Adigwe, the Director-General of the institute, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Saturday in Abuja that such move would restore confidence in local practitioners. According to him, it will eventually reduce the number of Nigerians seeking Medicare overseas. “The NIPRD has embarked on a project to have accreditation to train foreign trained pharmacists, which had already started yielding positive result. “A reversal of the brain drain means that we will be able to retain our best practitioners and that will repose confidence in our local practitioners and, ultimately, reverse medical tourism. “We at NIPRD have started a project of the institute being accredited to train and certify foreign trained graduates of pharmacy, and we have already started seeing huge increase in those of them returning to Nigeria,” he said. The DG also advised that herbal medicines had huge potential to improve the health system and also boost government revenue. He said that Nigeria had thousands of herbs with medical and pharmaceutical values, with potential to also boost government revenue. Adigwe assured that Nigeria could reap immense benefit from herbal medicines if properly harnessed and become a hub in the African continent.

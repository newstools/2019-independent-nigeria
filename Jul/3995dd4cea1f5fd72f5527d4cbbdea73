Adegboyega Oyetola, the Osun State governor, has urged the 2019 pilgrims to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to conduct themselves in line with the laws in the holy land.
The governor gave this admonition while speaking at a farewell meeting with the pilgrims to Mecca held on Saturday in Osogbo, the state capital.
He advised the 670 Osun pilgrims not to allow distractions of trading and other personal interests spoil the bountiful rewards of Hajj, which he described as one of the five pillars of Islam expected to be performed by every believing Muslim at least once in lifetime.
The governor said: “I am glad to be here meeting with all the lucky pilgrims in Osun State journeying to the holy land of Mecca in Saudi Arabia to perform the 2019 Hajj.
“Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam and it is a rewarding ritual that every Muslim is expected to perform, at least once in life time. I urge the pilgrims to focus on the primary purpose of embarking on pilgrimage by worshiping Allah with all your hearts.
“Trading is not part of Hajj. You should not allow some personal worldly distractions to prevent you from earning your rewards in full. You are also expected to conduct yourselves in line with the laws of Saudi Arabia.
“Remember, you are all from the land of virtue. I urge you all to allow the ‘Omoluabi’ ethos of our dear state reflect in our conduct throughout your stay in the holy land.”
Oyetola also reminded the pilgrims that Mecca is a place where God showers His mercies on His genuine worshippers and answer their prayers, urging them to remember his government and Osun State in their prayer during the Hajj.

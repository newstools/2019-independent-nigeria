The absence of fresh tomatoes and pepper from the North, where a larger percentage of the produce emanates has continued to have an adverse effect on their prices, making it to become beyond the reach of many. Traders are also unfavourably affected, as the situation has made some of them to abandon the trade because of the huge amount of money involved in procuring their normal purchases. The few ones that continued with the trade are left with no option than to reduce their normal supplies for continuity of the business. Despite the presence of fresh tomatoes from Cameroun, Benin Republic, and South West, scarcity still looms as the ones available appeared not to be adequately supplied. The situation saw some consumers opting for an alternative particularly those who could not afford the exorbitant price. During the week, visit to various markets across some states revealed that prices of the produce still remained high, soaring by over 50 per cent between May and July 18, 2019, of which many of them attributed to scarcity arising from off-season effect, high demand and logistics constraints, among others. Checks at the Ogbeogologo Market, Asaba, showed that prices of fresh tomatoes as well as pepper are yet to decline, but instead increased further, especially when compared with what they were initially sold. For example, a big basket of fresh tomatoes that earlier attracted N13,500 soared further to between N25,000 and N26,000, depending on the size and the haggling power of the buyer. Likewise, prices of a big bag of fresh pepper increased to between N18,000 and N20,000 as against N10,000 formerly sold. Mrs. Esther Ewuche, who retails the produce at the Ogbeogologo Market, Asaba, blamed the situation to insufficient supply from the North. That of Ose Market Onitsha was also on the high side, particularly with the prices of a basket of fresh tomatoes, currently ranging from N22,000 to N23,000 up from N15,000 it initially went for. Mallam Aminu, who trades in the produce at the Ose Market, Onitsha, in a chat with our correspondent, connected the persistent hike principally to seasonal factor. He, however, opined that tough days would soon be over, as the onset of its season of plenty would commence in no time. The same could be said for that of Oba Market, Benin City, Edo State, as prices of basket of fresh tomatoes that previously went for between N15,000 and N16,000 soared considerably, currently going for between N22,000 and N23,000 while that of fresh pepper bag currently sells N18,000 as against N12,000 sold previously. Many of the traders at the Oba Market, Benin City, linked the situation to unavailability usually associated with off-season effect. Checks at the Wuse Market, Abuja, revealed that a basket of fresh tomatoes formerly sold for between N7,500 and N8,000 escalated to between N11,500 and N12,500 while that of fresh tomatoes attracted N15,000, up from N10,000 initially sold. For Achau Market, Kaduna, a basket of fresh tomatoes previously sold for N8,000 increased to between N14,500 and N15,000 while a bag of fresh pepper also soared currently ranging from N17,500 to N18,500, a situation which many of the traders connected to scarcity and high cost of transportation . In Lafenwa Market, Ogun State, prices of the produce have been on steady rise since April ; for instance a big basket of fresh tomatoes initially sold for N11,000 went up to between N17,500 and N18,500 during the week ,whereas that of a big bag of fresh pepper sold initially for N10,000 rose to N16,000, signifying a 60 percent increase. Mr. Rahim Bashir, a tomatoes seller at the Lafenwa Market, Ogun State, ascribed the persistent hike to inadequate supply arising from off-season effect. That of Bodija Market, Ibadan, was not different from what was obtainable in other markets. For example, price of a basket of fresh tomatoes that previously went for N10,000 during the week shoot up to between N16,500 and N17,500. This, however, depends on the size of the basket and the bargaining power of the customer. The price of a bag of fresh pepper at the Bodija Market, Ibadan, also skyrocketed from N14,000 formerly sold to between N18,000 and N19,000 in the week under review. Many of the traders connected the situation to severe cut in supply due to scarcity. In Lagos, visit to popular Mile 12 Market, along Ikorodu Road, revealed that there was scarcity of the produce due to reduction in the number of trucks that arrived the market. Trucks sighted were conveying onions but none was seen for that of fresh tomatoes. Vehicles seen conveying the produce were buses from Cameroun, Benin Republic, Jos and South-West Nigeria. No truck from the North, major source of supply, was seen with the produce owing to scarcity which affected the price negatively. Prices of a basket of fresh tomatoes at the Mile 12 Market, Lagos, currently go for between N17,000 and N18,000 up from N10,000 previously sold, depending on the basket, quality and bargaining power of the buyer. Similarly that of big bag of fresh pepper also went up to between N19,500 and N20,000 while the ‘solo’ bag attracted between N10,500 and N11,000 as against N6,000 earlier sold. Mr. Anisere Babs, It urged the government to maximise benefits accruable from consumers and market right of access to multiple and diversified products and services and seek protection against abusive and injurious parties in and outside Nigeria based on ongoing capacity expansion of trade laws. who trades in the produce at the Mile 12 Market, Lagos, attributed the situation to seasonal effect usually associated with the produce.

Benin – Worried by the negative impact the non-resolution of the crisis rocking the Edo State House of Assembly could have on the state’s economy, the Benin Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (BENCCIMA) has urged political actors to shun activities that were capable of threatening peace and hurting business.
In a statement, Mrs. Atekha Odemwingie, the president of BENCCIMA, said the umbrella body of the Organised Private Sector at a recent meeting to review the prevailing circumstances in the state and effect on businesses and lives of the people, “unanimously agreed that the effort towards business development, employment generation and the overall economic development of our state cannot be realised without peace and tranquility among our leaders and all of us.”
According to Odemwingie, “The body appealed to all the actors to sheath their sword and embrace peace. BENCCIMA is highly bothered by the continuing political upheaval in the state because it is capable of causing businesses to fail. We are, therefore, calling on the political actors, stakeholders who are all involved in the present political crisis, to find a middle course to resolve their differences.”
She added, “The ugly development should be nipped in the bud immediately to guarantee a peaceful environment where businesses can thrive, and new investments attracted.
“We appeal passionately that they should put the interest of the people of Edo State first in order to guarantee the social and economic future of the state. We appeal to all the stakeholders in Edo State – men, women, youth, politicians, religious and community leaders to continue to pray for security, peace and progress of Edo State that guarantees the future of our children.”
She commended effort of Omo N’Oba N’Edo Uku AkpoloKpolo, Oba Ewuare II, the Benin monarch, for his efforts so far and urged him to sustain the peace move.

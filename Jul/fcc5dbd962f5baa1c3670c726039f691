As quoted by the Daily Record, Steven Gerrard has revealed why Eros Grezda has not left the club this summer, despite him being surplus to requirements for the coming campaign. Grezda has not been at Ibrox for long at all, but it is clear that he is struggling to make a claim to stay at the club past this summer. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Indeed, he just does not seem good enough to be frank, and that leaves him surely looking for new employment in this window. According to Gerrard, though, the reason that he hasn’t left yet is down to the fact that the offers that have come in for him are not what the Gers are open to. He revealed: “We’ve had two or three loan requests for Eros but they don’t satisfy what we are looking for at the moment.” It remains to be seen, then, whether or not the right sort of offer comes in for Grezda but it is safe to assume that he’s going to go if the deal suits the club. It makes sense to try and get as much as we can for him after the outlay we wasted on him but that could be a hard ask.

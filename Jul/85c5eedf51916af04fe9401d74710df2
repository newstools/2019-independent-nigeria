Daily Independent reports that the state, in a bid to diversify its economy, commenced the planting of about 7.5 million oil palm trees three years ago. According to the then commissioner for agriculture, Uzo Azubuike,” the state was embarking on the massive plantation of palm trees across the 17 Local Government Areas of the State with communities becoming co-owners, thereby create wealth, reduce unemployment and encourage Abians to grow edible plants”. The state commissioner for information, John Okiyi Kalu, revealed that Governor Okezie Ikpeazu has taken agriculture in the State to a higher level with many innovations introduced, including the new emphasis on value-adding to primary agricultural products from the state. While the state is set to launch a sophisticated agro-industrial cluster at Ubani Ibeku, Umuahia, the commissioner noted that the state mushroom farm graduates are already generating huge revenues from the business. He assured the farmers that the state would sustain and improve on the required financial support to them, in partnership with international donor agencies, CBN and Bank of Agriculture to ensure they produce enough food to sustain the people of the State and grow the economy.

LAGOS – Mothers of the Nations Organisation for Peace and Development, a faith based-group, has urged the Federal Government to tackle the challenges of insecurity in the nation. Bishop Priscilla Otuya, the group’s president, speaking with the media in Lagos at the weekend, noted that time has come for the voices of women to be heard on issues in the country. Otuya, while bemoaning the level of insecurity in Ni­geria, said that it had become very difficult to travel to any part of the country due to the fear of being attacked, kid­napped or even killed, adding that to make it worse, while Fulani herdsmen go about with sophisticated guns, the ordinary Nigerian has no right to bear arms, thereby living him at the mercy of Fulani herdsmen. She cautioned President Muhammadu Buhari and other leaders against mak­ing themselves lords over the people in the process of upholding their rights and privileges. She urged them to rather listen to the cries of Nigerians. Otuya, who noted that the hungry and homeless were crying, also warned leaders to avert the impending danger of uncontrollable chaos by making sure that the rights and privileges of the poor were upheld.

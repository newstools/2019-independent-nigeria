LAGOS – Joseph Yobo, former Super Eagles captain has taken a swipe at the team’s attacking line up following their dismal outing against the Fennecs Foxes of Algeria in their semifinal match played on Sunday in Cairo. He reckoned that the team’s array of stars upfront did not give enough firepower to rain goals for the squad in the encounter which they lost 2-1 at the dying minutes. He also questioned coach Gernot Rohr’s decision to change his tactics for the match instead of sticking with the approach that Nigeria victory against the Bafana Bafana of South Africa in the quarterfinal of the tournament. “I wonder why the coach changed his tactics for the all-important game. He did not go the same way with what they did against the Bafana Bafana of South Africa. “I would have thought it better to stick with an approach that gave us a good result in the quarterfinals, but he decided on something different. “That’s why we could not put any pressure on the Algerians; we did not have any pressing impact against their defenders all through the game. “I also wonder about our attackers. We did not see anything meaningful from them. There was hardly any force to scare their opponents. “A team that has Ighalo, Chukwueze, Musa, Simon, Onyekuru coming off the bench, they should have offered something more,” Yobo wondered.

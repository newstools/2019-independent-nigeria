Barcelona have reportedly rejected the chance to sign Tottenham Hotspur defender Danny Rose.
The Catalan outfit’s alleged need for a new left-back in this summer’s transfer window has led to links with Augsburg’s Philipp Max and Wolfsburg’s Jerome Roussillon. According to Sport, Barca were approached by Rose’s camp over a potential move for the England international, who has not travelled with the Tottenham squad on their pre-season tour. However, the report claims that the Spanish champions turned down the opportunity to sign the 29-year-old as the club feel that there are better options elsewhere. Rose, who has also been linked with Paris Saint-Germain, made 37 appearances for Mauricio Pochettino’s side during the 2018-19 campaign, including eight in the Champions League. Spurs are said to be willing to sell the former Leeds United youngster this summer for a figure in the region of £20m.

Sam Allardyce, former manager has claimed that Wilfried Zaha should leave Crystal Palace as soon as possible. Zaha has enjoyed two successful periods with the Eagles, netting a total of 53 goals from 322 appearances in all competitions, but the winger has allegedly expressed a desire to join Arsenal. However, despite the Gunners struggling to meet Palace’s £80m valuation, Allardyce feels that Arsenal need to make a bigger effort to complete a deal in the coming weeks. Allardyce told talkSPORT: “If Manchester United are having to pay £90m for a centre-half, which is what they’ve been quoted for [Harry] Maguire, then this £70-£80m price tag being put on Zaha is well worth it in light of the market we’re operating in today. “Wilfried is proven at this level and he’d be a massive success at Arsenal. He’s ready, but Arsenal need to stop messing around like they are the minute. “Wilfried is in his prime – there’s not too many players like him about. Steve [Parish] won’t like me saying this, because I’ve got a lot of respect for the man and for what he’s done for Crystal Palace, but if Wilf doesn’t leave very shortly then he never will. “He’s ready now to move on now, so Arsenal just need to get the deal done.” Everton and Bayern Munich are also said to be monitoring the situation.

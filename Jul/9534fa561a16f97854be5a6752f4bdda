Osogbo – A security expert, Group Captain Segun Fanu (rtd), has admonished the government at the centre to dialogue with the dreadful Islamic group, Shiite in order to avert the scenario that played out during the early days of Boko Haram insurgency.
Fanu gave the advice in Osogbo during the 2019 National Security Conference and Public Lecture, organised by the Police Community Relations Committee (PCRC), of the Nigeria Police Force, Osun State command.
He said from his observation of the Shiite and their activities, Shiite are not just a group of people that don’t know what they were doing but rather he saw a group of well-trained ex or serving military who are determined.
Speaking specifically on the need for dialogue, Captain Fanu, in his words said, “in wars, troops can withdraw from a particular theatre of war to go and reorganise.” He advised the Federal government to shift back a little bit and accommodate some of their demands.
Capt Segun Fanu, identified a lack of institutional capacity, loss of communal values, weak security system, unemployment, and poverty among others as reasons for kidnapping and banditry in the country.
Speaking on the theme, “Kidnapping and Banditry: Understanding the Twin Menace”, Fanu said winning the war against kidnapping and banditry require a deep understanding of the history of insecurity vis-a-vis the forms of crime, causes, threats, strategies for containment and eradication.

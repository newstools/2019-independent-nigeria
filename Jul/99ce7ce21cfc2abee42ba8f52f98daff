KANO – Kano State residents have been urged to assist the effort of the state government in maintaining the roads in the state.
Idris Wada, the managing director of Kano State Road Maintenance Agency (KARMA), made the call, complaining that attitudes of some residents contribute to the dilapidating state of roads in the state, which included blockage of drainages with refuse and washing of vehicles beside main roads.
Wada said the agency, from 2015 to date, had successfully repaired 85 percent of the dilapidated roads in the state with the maximum support from the state governor, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje.
He added that the agency was also constructing new roads in some local government areas in the state.
Wada estimated that in Kano Local Government metropolis, there are 1,500 roads they were working on.

South African rapper,AKA is having quite a hard time on social media with his Twitter and Instagram accounts flooded with Nigerians trolling him over Super Eagles’ triumphant victory against the Bafana Bafana of South Africa. Last night,Nigeria eliminated South Africa from the 2019 African Cup of Nations after thrashing them 2-1 in the quarter-final clash which took place at the Cairo International Stadium. Before the game, AKA had already taken to social media to brag about the match, which later didn’t go as planned as his country succumbed to defeat in the hands of the Super Eagles.

Lagos – Ahmed Musa, Super Eagles captain in the 2-1 victory over the Bafana Bafana of South Africa in the second quarterfinal of the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) has listed factors that aided the team to victory in the match. The attacker disclosed that a tactical approach based on patience and staying calm under pressure helped the team to defeat South Africa. He admitted that during a Radio Sports programme monitored in Lagos that the Super Eagles relied to a large extent on wing play, which would have left the match too open had they also gone on full attack all through the game, hence their decision to sit back and absorb pressure. The player, who was replaced by Moses Simon, gave plaudits to the young ones, especially Samuel Chukwueze, who was named Man of the Match, following a super goal and great display. “Both teams play from the wings; so, we told ourselves we have to be patient in this game, not to rush ourselves looking for goals. “That was why we stayed back for them to attack and waited for them to do what they wanted to do before we reacted. “We watched what they did against the Pharaohs of Egypt, how they like putting the ball behind the defenders, and it worked for them. “We had to be careful; this was not the time to joke. But we know we have a good team. “Even when we lost to Madagascar, we know what we can do and that we can win. We told ourselves we will not lose another match again. “Now we have won, we are in the semifinals, and we are all happy. It was also good to see young players like Chukwueze doing so well. “We the older ones are about to leave. It means there will be some players ready to take over once we leave. That’s very good for Nigeria.” Meanwhile, the Super Eagles will on Sunday take on the Desert Foxes of Algeria in the semifinal match of the tournament on Sunday.

Mikel, who made 88 appearances for the three-time African champions, announced his retirement from the national team on Thursday.

Ighalo, who won the recently-concluded continental competition’s Golden Boot award with five goals, has also heralded his decision to retire from the Super Eagles. Musa, has taken to the social media to wish his former teammates the best in their future endeavours. “As hard as it is to accept that you guys have retired from the National Team, it’s been nothing but a privilege and a great honour to play with you guys,” Musa posted on Instagram. “Here’s wishing you nothing but the absolute best in your future pursuits. You will be greatly missed in the team John Obi Mikel and Odion Ighalo.”

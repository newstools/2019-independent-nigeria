China gradually takes over the purchase of agricultural products from US companies, one of the key drawbacks of the trade war between both nations, official sources reported here on Sunday. A shipment with millions of tons of soybeans was shipped from the United States to China, which means the resumption of an activity that was stopped due to the worsening in relations between the two powers. According to a Chinese official quoted by the local press, the resumption of soy purchases from US producers is part of the steps towards understanding after the meeting between Presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump in Japan during the G20 Summit. Past May, China decided to curb the acquisition of soybeans from the United States due to the intensification of the conflict and the repressive measures of Washington against Asian companies. The halt of soybean imports by China occurred amid ups and downs in the price of the oilseed and US producers complaining about the damage caused by the commercial war initiated by the White House. Although President Trump announced a $16 billion dollar aid for farmers affected by escalating tensions, many feared that China would decide to buy that raw material in other countries, even after the dispute ended.

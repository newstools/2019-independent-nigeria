Virgil van Dijk and his fellow Nations League boys got down to business again on Saturday as they reported back to Liverpool pre-season.
Van Dijk, Jordan Henderson, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Georginio Wijnaldum were given some extra time off following their Nations League exploits at the back end of last season in Portugal.
And on Saturday morning, the England and Holland stars returned to Liverpoolâ€™s Melwood training base as they look to hit ground running before the new campaign.
Following their historic Champions League triumph in Madrid, there is clearly a special bond at Liverpool and that was highlighted by Jurgen Klopp.
The German manager was seen warmly embracing the Reds quartet as they joined up with their team-mates once again.
Van Dijk and Co will be looking to pick up from where they left off after a brilliant last campaign both domestically and in Europe.
Liverpool, captained by Henderson and marshalled in defence by Van Dijk, claimed their sixth European title in June by beating Tottenham 2-0 in the Champions League final in Madrid.
They also took the Premier League title race right down to the last match of the season, with City pipping the Reds by an agonising one point.
Klopp will be determined to go one better next season and lead Liverpool to their first Premier League title.

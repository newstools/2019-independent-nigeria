ILESA – Superintendent Apostle E.O. Robert of Sacred Cherubim and Seraphim Oke Iro, Ilesa, Osun State, has tongue lashed some politicians who fail to deliver dividends of Democracy to their constituents after series of promises to do so during their campaigns to be elected into offices. Dr. Robert stated this while delivering sermon at the thanksgiving service in honour of Osun State Governor Gboyega Oyetola on his victory at the Federal Supreme Council recently and the successful inauguration of 7th Osun State House of Assembly. Apostle Robert who is head of the church said some politicians who wanted to be elected into offices at all costs would make series of promises to electorate just to be disappointed after getting want they wanted from the people who voted them into offices. The evangelist who pointed to Holy Bible to buttress his point said every unfulfilled promise would be visited by God as he warned politicians to always do what they promised the electorate during their campaigns. At a point during the sermon, he disengaged from the pulpit to hand over the speaker Osun State House of Assembly Rt Hon Timothy Owoeye to generality of members of the Assembly to work together in peace and to all politicians present at the thanksgiving service to always give the speaker advice that would make progress in the Assembly and Osun State in general.

Pep Guardiola remains hopeful of adding one more signing but insisted Manchester City have enough depth to defend the Premier League title. City parted ways with Vincent Kompany and Fabian Delph this summer and brought in Rodri and Angelino. Guardiola is still hunting for a central defender and has an interest in free agent Dani Alves if Danilo leaves for Serie A. But the City boss believes they can go again without any further additions. ‘It won’t be many,’ Guardiola said. ‘The market is so difficult but the team is really good enough. Maybe zero, maybe one, maybe one-and-a-half. ‘If we believe we can do it then we will but we can survive.’ John Stones candidly admitted to making too many mistakes earlier this week and Guardiola pushed him to improve.

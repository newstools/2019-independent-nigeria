Senegalese FA boss Saee Seck says Sadio Mane has fulfilled his potential at Liverpool and wants him to join Real Madrid this summer. The 27-year-old won the Premier League Golden Boot last season and there has been consistent reports in the Spanish media that Zidane sees him as the final piece of his Madrid jigsaw that will challenge Barcelona for the La Liga title next season according to mirror.co.uk. The former Southampton man only recently signed a long term deal in Merseyside and has distanced himself from reports of a switch to the Spanish capital, but his country’s FA boss says it’s time for him to make the big move. “Everybody in the world knows that Mane is in the top ten best footballers in the world and he has achieved significant success at Liverpool in the past season,” Seck told the Mirror Sports in Cairo. “He alongside Mo Salah and Firmino are phenomenal. But this is football and he won the Champions League last season and he has the chance to go to Madrid. For me, I think it’s the best club in the world, even if I am a Barcelona fan I still think Real is the best and Mane should be thinking of that offer seriously. “The career of a footballer is very short and sometimes you don’t get the chance a lot so if it’s there, and I think Zidane likes him, why not? “He played in Southampton and when the chance came he took it and went to Liverpool and he has held the challenge well in England. I think he will do well with another challenge in another country.” Mane is currently enjoying a good Africa Cup of Nations with three goals and two assists in the competition making him the stand out contributor to his country’s quest to win their first AFCON.

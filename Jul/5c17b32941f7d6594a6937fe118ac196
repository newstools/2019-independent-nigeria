LAGOS – Ahead of today’s quarter final match between Nigeria and South Africa, Bafana Bafana coach, Stuart Baxter, has said that much as he admired and respect the Super Eagles, he was in no way afraid of them as both sides square up for a semifinal ticket. In a press conference in Cairo, the coach acknowledged that Nigeria remained one of the super powers in the continent and one of the favourites but wrote off the threat of the three-time champions, even as he promised to go for a win. “We definitely respect the Super Eagles, but not afraid of them. They are one of the superpowers in African football, and we have to respect that, but on the pitch things will be different,” Baxter told a news conference in Cairo on Tuesday. “It is true that we got a good result against Egypt, but we have to stay grounded. We may have to try different things from what we did against Nigeria in the past, but we are confident of beating them again,” he said. On whether they have what it takes to stop Nigeria’s Odion Ighalo, who is a joint top scorer so far in the competition, the Englishman said: “We don’t make plans to stop individual players , rather we will do it as a team. We will find a way of stopping the ball from getting to him. It is up to our back four to do that. The midfielders too have to help screen the defence.”

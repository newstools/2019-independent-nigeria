Jurgen Klopp, Liverpool boss is reportedly keeping tabs on Sporting Lisbon youngster Idrissa Doumbia. The Reds boss is believed to be after at least one more new player before the transfer window closes, but he has ruled out any big-money signings. Portuguese outlet Record reports that Doumbia has caught Klopp’s attention and he has earmarked a move for the 21-year-old, who impressed for Sporting in their 2-2 draw with Liverpool earlier this week. Doumbia made 14 appearances for the Primeira Liga outfit last term after arriving from Akhmat Grozny in January. Liverpool have made just one signing during the off-season, bringing in Sepp van den Berg from PEC Zwolle for £1.3m.

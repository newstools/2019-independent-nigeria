OWERRI – The candidates of the Peoples Democratic Party, Chukwuka Agwunobi and Action Alliance, Joy Mbawike, have withdrawn their court cases challenging the victory of the Speaker of the Imo state House of Assembly, Collins Chiji at the polls. Chiji, who contested on the platform of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) had defected to the PDP along with other candidates to emerge the reelected member of Isiala Mbano state constituency. Counsels to the PDP and Action Alliance (AA) candidates had told the tribunal sitting in Owerri that their clients had instructed them to withdraw the petitions before it. The PDP candidate confirmed the development when contacted on the phone by our correspondent on Thursday. The PDP candidate said, “In order to set an example and to avoid a repeat of the ugly scenario that befell Isiala Mbano and Okigwe zone in 2011, I have chosen to sacrifice my ambition and support my brother, Rt. Hon. Chiji Collins for the good and collective interest of our people.” “I took this decision after wide consultation with my family members, my faithful supporters and the intervention of our political leaders in Okigwe and Isiala Mbano, and other critical stakeholders in our state leadership.” “Special mention is the fatherly intervention of the governor, Emeka Ihedioha.” Mike Ohaka, who is one of the counsels to the speaker told our correspondent that with the two withdrawals, there was no more legal contention concerning the emergence of the speaker.

Yenagoa – The Bayelsa State Government has constituted a three-member committee to investigate the cause of Tuesday’s fire disaster that razed down the state-owned radio station, Glory FM 97.1, in Yenagoa.
Inaugurating the committee in his office in Yenagoa, Daniel Iworiso-Markson, the state commissioner for information, said the committee’s findings would help to prevent future occurrence.
The inferno, which occurred in the early hours of Tuesday, destroyed the accounts department, production/recording studio, live studio and the control room as well as vital files and documents and the roof, among others.
Iworiso-Markson said it was premature to speculate what might have led to the fire outbreak.
He expressed confidence in members of the committee to deliver on the assignment, urging them not to be swayed by any commentary as that might preempt their work.
The information and orientation commissioner informed that plans were underway to put in place a temporal measure to bring the station back on air by the weekend, pending the building of a brand new structure and facilities.

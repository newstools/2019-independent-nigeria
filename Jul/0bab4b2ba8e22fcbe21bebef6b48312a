BAUCHI – Faruk Mustapha, the Senatorial candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) for Bauchi North in the 2019 Election has identified a total of 745 exhibits tendered against Senator Adamu Bulkachuwa of the All Progressives Congress (APC) at Bauchi National and State Assembly Elections Tribunal. Mustapha’s counsel, Joe Dappa, stated this at the end of the court’s sitting while speaking with newsmen where he said that the exhibits contained in two big “Ghana Must Go” bags, was to support the claim that the last Bauchi north senatorial election was allegedly rigged in favour of Bulkachuwa. Recall that Mustapha and NNPP had on March 15, 2019, filed a petition before the tribunal challenging the election of Adamu Bulkachuwa of the APC as senator for Bauchi Northern Senatorial District.

LAGOS – Despite calls for the sack of Coach Gernot Rohr, the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has passed a vote of confidence on him. Amaju Pinnick, President of the NFF in an interview on Monday night in Cairo, said that there was no such plan to sack the coach. “Gernot Rohr will not be sacked as @NGSuperEagles coach. He will remain in the job. I have complete confidence in him. “Rohr has taken us to the semifinal, the target we set for him. There are some people that have been calling on me and the federation to sack him. “But I am not going to do that. In fact, Rohr is going on a refresher training period with @ FCBayernEN, after the #AFCON2019. We have a long-term plan with him. “We have had rocky and difficult moments in our relationship, but this is normal in any relationship between two people. He is a good coach and we want him to remain with us. That said, we will work together on what needs to be improved upon,” said Pinnick. The Super Eagles struggled to beat Burundi 1-0 in their Africa Cup of Nations opening match and also labored hard to beat Guinea by the same margin in their second match before their unexpected 2-0 loss to Madagascar. In their round of 16 match, the Super Eagles came from 2-1 down to beat Cameroon 3-2 and also beat South Africa 2-1 in the quarter-finals. However, against Algeria, they lost 2-1, conceding a last gasp freekick that but put paid to their qualification for the final.

The president of the Confederation of Africa Football (CAF) has refused to propose President of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) Amaju Pinnick for a second two-year term as Vice President of the continental football body, after the expiration of his (Pinnick) first tenure on Thursday. Pinnick’s term as the 1st Vice President of CAF along with that of the 2nd and 3rd Vice Presidents expired on Thursday. In line with Article 22(4) of the CAF Statutes, every two years when elections are held at the CAF Congress (as took place Thursday), the CAF Executive Committee on the proposal of the CAF President, elects 1st, 2nd and 3rd Vice President respectively from among its members. Significantly, the renewal of Amaju Pinnick’s tenure was not proposed by the CAF President because of fundamental differences on focus and direction. Pinnick accepted the decision of the President as it aligned with his own view having considered matters surrounding the administration of African Football which has dovetailed into the Nigerian Football space. He will however remain a bonafide member of the CAF Executive Committee to continue with his mandate as such. Pinnick further noted: “It has however been an excellent opportunity to serve as the number two football administrator in the entire African continent and my commitment to the game is perpetual while my support for my colleagues in the Executive Committee remains steadfast. I congratulate Omari, Lekjaa and Danny on the assumption of their new roles as 1st, 2nd and 3rd Vice CAF Presidents respectively”.

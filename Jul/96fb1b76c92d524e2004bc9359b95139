Authorities in Lisbon’s old town are battling shared electric scooters abandoned on sidewalks, which locals increasingly describe as a scourge. On Monday, the Lisbon parish of Santa Maria Maior – which oversees much of the historic centre and the neighbouring areas – introduced fines between 60 and 300 euros for companies whose rented scooters litter sidewalks and public spaces. The council also banned the parking of the scooters on sidewalks and in places that “obstruct vehicles on sidewalks” and introduced a “removal fee” to be covered by the companies. The regulation also extends to shared bicycles and segways that have been badly parked in public spaces, Portuguese newspaper Publico reported. Over the past year, nine companies flooded Lisbon and eight other Portuguese cities including Faro and Coimbra with thousands of electric scooters, or “trotinetas” as they are known locally, which their customers use for short city trips.

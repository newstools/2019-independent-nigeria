Tottenham have named their price for prized asset Christian Eriksen as Spanish giants Atletico Madrid look set to bid for the Danish playmaker, According to Mirror.co.uk. According to AS , an emissary authorised by the north London club met with Miguel Angel Gil, Chief Executive Officer of Atletico, to discuss the sale of the midifelder. The same report suggests Eriksen will be available for €60-70million. The 27-year-old joined Spurs back in the summer of 2013 from Dutch giants Ajax, costing the club just £12m at the time. Eriksen signed new contract back in 2016 but that contract expires at the end of the season. Atletico are a club whose business does not look finished this summer, with rumours suggesting that Angel Correa is on his way to Milan. If Correa were to leave Los Rojiblanco, they would need to reinforce their attack and one of the names alongside James Rodriguez is Eriksen. With Eriksen’s contract up in the summer, and no apparent approach for a renewal, €60-70m could be an absolute steal for a player who has a market value of €100m on Transfermarkt . Eriksen is currently playing some of his best football to date after helping Spurs to the Champions League Final. He is a player that stands out for his quality on the ball in dead ball situations and his technical ability in build-up play. Eriksen was a part of the squad that travelled to Singapore for the International Champions Cup, despite having to train alone after minor surgery. Last season he played 51 games in all competitions, scoring 10 goals and making 17 assists.

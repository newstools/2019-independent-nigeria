SOKOTO – The Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC), Sokoto zonal office, on Saturday marked the Africa International Anti-Corruption Day.
Abdullahi Lawal, the EFCC zonal coordinator, who spoke during the occasion, said his office was prosecuting three cases of corruption in the court in Sokoto, while it had recovered N70 million and some vehicles.
He maintained that the commission was making final arrangements for the arraignment and prosecution of five suspects in connection with various degrees of financial offences.
He said the zonal office was seeking a court order for the forfeiture of some properties recovered from suspects.
The commission, he informed, was collaborating with sister agencies in other African countries in the fight against economic and financial crimes.
He said those who fled the country with cases of corruption hanging on their necks would not find a safe haven in Africa.
He further told journalists that the day would also be marked with road walk in and around Sokoto metropolis to alert members of the public on the existence of the zonal office.
He said most of the petitions and complaints received by the zonal office were centred on fake businesses with higher returns
Lawal warned people to beware of fake business owners who would promise them heaven and earth when they invest with them.
He appealed to people of the three states of Sokoto, Kebbi and Zamfara to report all cases of corruption and financial offences to the zonal office for prompt action.

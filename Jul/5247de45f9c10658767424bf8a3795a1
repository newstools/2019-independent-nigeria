The Group Executive Director, BUA Group, Kabiru Rabiu has given insights on how to tackle the challenges of the sugar industry in Nigeria. Speaking on the topic ‘Challenges of Emerging Sugar Companies in Meeting the Sugar Demand in Nigeria’ at the maiden conference of the Sugarcane Technologies Society of Nigeria (STSN) in Abuja, Rabiu stated that huge capital cost, conflicts in land acquisition, insecurity, infrastructure deficit, water and environmental issues, lack of synergy among regulatory agencies and skill deficit are factors contributing to the slow implementation of the Backward Integration Plan. Kabiru then urged the Federal Government to double its efforts in addressing these deficiencies in the sugar industry while commending the National Sugar Development Council (NSDC) for stimulating investment in local sugar production for self-sufficiency. “The Federal Government through the NSDC can help by creating of Sugar Hubs, Sugar sector Intervention Fund, Infrastructure Gap Bridging, Direct Land Acquisition, synergy among various Stakeholders and building capacity among the industry regulators. “Nigeria is Africa’s largest sugar importer with consumption ranging between 1.5m – 1.7m tonnes per annum. That is around 8kg per head which is low compared to the Africa average of 17kg. This is due to challenges such as the high cost of sugar production, heavy capital investment such as plantation development, irrigation facilities and mills construction. Other factors include direct land acquisition by investors, unending conflicts with landowners and communities, security challenges and Lack of infrastructure like roads, electricity, Development infrastructure increases the project cost”. Kabiru went on to list BUA’s performance in its integrated sugar plantation in Lafiagi which when completed will produce 20 million liters of ethanol per annum from the ethanol plant, generate 35megawatt of electricity both for factory and national grid consumption and 200,000 metric tonnes of refined sugar annually.

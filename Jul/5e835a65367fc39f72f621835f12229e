Umuahia. – Disturbed by high cost of powering his local government, Mr Kelechi Onyenze Ezechukwu, council transition committee chairman of Umuahia North Metropolitan Council of Abia State, has that reconnecting the council to the public electricity supply would form part of his priorities. Investigation revealed that the council had been disconnected from the national grid for over three years over indebtedness to the distribution company. Speaking to the DAILY INDEPENDENT after the weekend’s statewide sanitation exercise in Umuahia, he said when he came on board as the transition committee chairman he noticed that the council was disconnected from the national grid, a situation he said he led to running the council on a generating set. Ezechukwu said he had spoken with the Enugu Electricity Distribution Company (EEDC) on to link the council back to the national grid. On the public outcry by residents of the capital city over operations of a taskforce on illegal parking along some major streets, the transition committee said he was aware and had directed his deputy, Eze Okwulehie, to constitute and monitor the situation.

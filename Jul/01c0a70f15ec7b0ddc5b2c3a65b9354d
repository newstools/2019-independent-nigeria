Juventus is determined to see Matthijs De Ligt joining them as soon as possible, even if that means losing one of their rising talents in the process, According to Livesoccertv.com. Reports published by La Gazzetta dello Sport reveal that negotiations between the bianconeri and Ajax have hit a wall, mainly due to the fact that a transfer fee has not been agreed. Ajax is reportedly asking for over $75M, while Juventusâ€™ offer has not gone past the $56M barrier. With that in mind, and given that time is of the essence, Juventus is ready to offer Ajax a sweetener in the deal, which would force them to send rising star Moise Kean on loan to the Dutch side. Kean played 17 games for Juventus in all comps, scoring 7 goals for the bianconeri in the recently concluded season. Kean has also played for the Italian National Team, scoring two goals in three games. Personal terms have been agreed between Juventus and De Ligt, leaving things up to Ajax. The Dutch side has already lost Frenkie De Jong to Barcelona, and any additions that represent a boost to their squad should be welcomed by Erik Ten Hag.

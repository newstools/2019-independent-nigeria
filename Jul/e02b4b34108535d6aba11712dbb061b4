Lagos – Alloy Agu, Super Eagles assistant coach, says the team is open to all Nigerian eligible goalkeepers. Agu said this against the backdrop of the lingering goalkeeping crisis in the team of late. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Since the sudden exit of Carl Ikeme due to illness about two years ago, the team has not found a capable replacement, despite opportunities given to several goalkeepers. Agu, who spoke with our correspondent on Tuesday, said that Coach Gernot Rohr was not resting in his quest to get a capable goalkeeper for the team. Though, he noted that the goalkeepers that represented Nigeria at the just concluded Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt did their best, he, however, said that it did not mean that new prospects were not welcomed into the team. “We are still open to new players, including goalkeepers, because the desire of the coach is to see a better Super Eagles that can make Nigeria proud anywhere. So if you have a better goalkeeper than the one we have in the team, let us know,” he said. It will be recalled that the Super Eagles goalkeeping department came under scathing remarks from Nigerians after several blunders supposedly cost Nigeria vital games.

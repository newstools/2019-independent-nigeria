LOKOJA – The Kogi State Primary Healthcare Development Agency (KSPHCDA), has appealed to Local Government Administrators to give maximum support to its activities to enhance quality healthcare delivery to the people at the grassroots. Dr Abubarka Yakubu, Executive Director, KSPHCDA, made the call at the inauguration of the first round of the 2019 Maternal, Newborn, Child Health Week (MNCHW), held at Banquet Hall, Government House, Lokoja. ”If the SPHCDA is going to ever operate at optimal level, all hands must be on deck. ”With the recent financial autonomy of the Local Governments, it has become very necessary for them to support our routine immunisation as well distribution of vaccines to hard to reach areas in their communities,” Yakubu said. He, therefore, appealed to the Local Government Administrators to key into the activities of the agency especially Routine Immunisation (RI), stressing that the overall success of their activities would be central to local authorities. He noted that Kogi State had been certified free of Polio virus for 10 years now, but cautioned that the detection of wpv1 and cvdpv2 in Nigeria and neighbouring States, underscored the importance of maintaining high level of RI coverage at all levels

A women group, African Women on Board (AWB), a non-profit organisation dedicated to reshaping the future for African women and girls, has condemned the behaviour displayed in a recent viral video of a lawmaker attacking a woman in Nigeria.
Consequently, AWB has called for a greater societal shift in culture across the continent and urged the senate to recall Abbo from the upper legislative chamber.
The clip of Senator Abbo showed him in a shop assaulting a woman beside the cash register, while flanked by other men who are reticent to intervene and stop the attack. In the wake of the public reaction to the video, Abbo has issued an apology.
The group said: “Given the appalling behaviour displayed in the footage, is an apology enough? Shouldn’t we demand more from our elected officials to send a clear message that abuse of any form is unacceptable, no matter who carries it out?
“AWB identifies this behaviour as utterly disgraceful. However, the overarching culture which allows violence against women to thrive is even more deplorable.
“The continent as a whole can only move forward if we take time to reflect on how we are holding women back and physically keeping them in harm’s way,” says AWB founder and chair, Dr. Nkiru Balonwu.
The Senate has ordered a two-week probe into the incident.
AWB said further: “If the situation was reversed, would the senate hesitate to call for the woman’s arrest? Aren’t the woman’s account and the video sufficient evidence of what transpired? We cannot wait two weeks! The evidence is clear and the next steps are unquestionable. Senator Abbo must resign.
“The role of the bystander must be challenged. Ask yourself. Are my silence and inaction making me complicit in the abuse and brutalisation of another?

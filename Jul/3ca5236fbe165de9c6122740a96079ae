It’s not just Marvel getting in on the de-ageing technology these days. After Samuel L Jackson’s incredible transformation for Captain Marvel, director Ang Lee is going one better – pitting Will Smith against a younger version of himself in sci-fi thriller Gemini Man. And now we’ve got a new look at the two Smiths in action. Gemini Man sees Smith play Henry Brogen – an ageing assassin who’s looking to get out of the game, but who’s hunted down by a younger clone of himself (think his mid-90s Fresh Prince/Independence Day era) who can predict his every move. Clive Owen is on baddie duties as the sinister creator of ‘Junior’, while Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Doctor Strange’s Benedict Wong are on hand to help the older Smith figure out what the hell’s going on.

Reports in Italy suggest Inter Milan are set to join Juventus in their attempts to sign Matteo Darmian in order to fill a void at full back. According to transfer expert Gianluca Di Marzio, Antonio Conte is a huge fan of the Manchester United man and could be tempted to move for him if the Nerazzurri lose Dalbert over the next few weeks according to goal.com. With Juve also seeking reinforcements, Di Marzio insists the Turin giants are monitoring Darmian’s situation but believes that Inter might move quickly to secure a €10 million deal for the 29-year-old.

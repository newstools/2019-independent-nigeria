A group known as Social Integrity Network has warned that Nigeria’s economy is on the verge of collapse and requires urgent actions by the technical know-how. The group who disclosed that Nigeria remains the economic giant of Africa as evidently revealed by statistics and recurrent circumstances attributed the many havocs bedeviling the country’s economy to some government monitoring agencies, especially those who are directly involved in the economic and security sectors. The group’s National Coordinator, Jubrin Abdulmalik said its investigation into the nation’s port management and pre-shipment management has revealed that the nation’s security has been exposed to abuse, gross misconducts, undue connivance as well as aiding and abetting illegal importation of substandard products into the country. According to him, “The security challenges bedeviling Nigeria cannot be defeated if activities of such monitoring agencies are not checked, as firearms may be finding their ways into Nigeria through such means. “The administration of President Muhammadu Buhari had over the years shown serious concerns and attention towards ensuring that rapid economic recovery is achieved thereby graduating to sustainability through the support of stakeholders in the various sectors of the nation. “While corruption can only be perceived as a problem biting hard in all sectors of the nation, accomplices of such acts are nothing but rebels and saboteurs who are hindering the laudable initiatives of Federal Government through its monetary and regulatory agencies. “Our investigation into the nation’s port management and pre-shipment management has revealed that the nation’s security has been exposed to abuse, gross misconducts, undue connivance as well as aiding and abetting illegal importation of substandard products into the country at the detriment of the masses.”

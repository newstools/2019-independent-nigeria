Chelsea are reportedly prepared to listen to offers for Tiemoue Bakayoko as new boss Frank Lampard attempts to trim down his squad. The former Monaco midfielder spent last season on loan at AC Milan after struggling to adapt to the Premier League following his £40 million move. The 24-year-old has been involved in the Blues’ preseason preparations but according to The Telegraph, Lampard has not been sufficiently impressed amid constraints on his squad. Lampard will need to omit a senior foreign player from his 25-man Premier League squad ahead of the new season, while the Blues will need to include at 17 homegrown players in their Champions League squad. Chelsea are reportedly willing to consider allowing Bakayoko to head out on loan again next season, or move permanently. Paris Saint-Germain were among clubs said to be interested in the player, however it remains to be seen whether they will bid for the player following the arrival of Everton’s Idrissa Gueye for £28m.

ASABA – Nigeria’s most ranked Catholic Prelate, His Em­inence, Cardinal Francis Arinze, has given reasons why no one in West Africa has been canonized. He called on the Catholic Church in West Africa to com­mit resources and personnel towards the beautification and canonization of their departed faithful. Cardinal Arinze, who made this call in Asaba during the 12th Ojefua Commemoration Lecture organized by the Order of the Knights of St Mulumba in Asaba, stated that it was the responsibility of any diocese to begin the campaign to get its candidate beautified. According to Cardinal, “There are many Christians whose cause of beatification and canonization could be pro­moted. lt is religious congrega­tion which show interests, read­iness to allocate personnel and funds for the promotion of the causes of their members and institutional interest.” Commending the Knights of the Order for campaigning for the beautification of Oje­fua, he lamented that not one individual had been canonized in the West Africa unlike Italy where almost every corner has a saint. In his welcome address, the Metro Grand-Knight of Benin Metropolitan Council of KSM, Sir Austin Mowah, said that Asaba remained a moot point in the evolution of the order “as it was at St Patrick’s Col­lege Westend that Rev Fr An­slem Ojefua nurtured the idea of a Catholic Order to coun­teract the nefarious activities of secret societies in the early 1950s.” While commending Wor­thy Supreme Knight, Sir Diamond Ovueraye, Mowah stressed that the Ojefua com­mittee had refreshed the im­petus to accelerate the pace for the process of beautifying their founding father.

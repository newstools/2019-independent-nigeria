Prof. Chidi Odinkalu, former chairman of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), has raised alarm over two women who he said are being detained by the Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad (FSARS) in Abuja.
Odinkalu, in a tweet on Friday with a photo of the women lying face down in black apparel, said they were shot and injured during the violent clash between the Shiites and the police in Abuja on Monday.
He named the women as Ummu, an undergraduate, and Fatima, a dentist.
According to the law professor, the women are yet to receive medical assistance on their gunshot wounds.
“Ummu, a 200-Level Microbiology university undergrad & Fatima, a Dentist, were reportedly shot & injured during the #ShiiteProtest in Abuja, #Nigeria’s Federal Capital, last Monday. Currently detained with the #FSARS in Abuja, they have yet to receive any medical assistance,” he said.

For the 2018/2019 academic session and 14th convocation, Motunrayo Ajia of the Department of Petroleum Engineering, College of Engineering, emerged not only as of the Best Overall Graduating student for the session, but she also made a perfect score of 5 points, the first in the history of the university. The Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Aaron Atayero, in his welcome remarks at the event gave a breakdown of other degree classifications as 215 First Class, 668 Second Class Upper, 415 in the Second Class Lower, while 43 were in the Third Class grade. He added, “As for Higher degrees, there are 42 PhD, 162 M.Sc, 23 M.Eng, MBA 16, M.A 4 and PGD 2”. Speaking further, the VC described education as a powerful weapon that could be deployed to effect positive change in the world and for the attainment of sustainable economic growth, especially in the African continent. “The institution is committed to supporting and encouraging research and development work aimed at providing innovative solutions to societal problems and enhancing the quality of life enunciated in the sustainable development goals,” he said. Also, the Chancellor, Dr David Oyedepo, emphasised the need for Africa’s most populous nation, Nigeria and indeed the entire continent to deploy more resources to fund education to drive and achieve meaningful growth and development. Dismissing as a baseless notion of the Blackman as a lesser being to other races, he urged Africans to rise and begin to toe the path of greatness for their people, saying that second fiddle roles could be done away with through deliberate investment in the education sector.

Lebanese military units demolished at least 20 refugee homes early on Monday, a group of international aid agencies said, warning that they feared more demolitions would follow and that thousands of people including children could be affected. The army did not immediately comment on the aid agencies’ statement, but a security source said the military had been carrying out checks to make sure refugee dwellings were sticking to regulations according to Reuters. Lebanon is toughening its enforcement of rules governing the roughly 1 million Syrian refugees who constitute about a quarter of the tiny country’s population. The small concrete huts in which many refugees live to break rules against building semi-permanent structures in their informal camps, something some Lebanese fear would lead to their lasting settlement in the country.

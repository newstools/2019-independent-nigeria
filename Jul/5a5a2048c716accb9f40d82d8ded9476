Barcelona are reportedly targeting Bayern Munich’s David Alaba as some left-back competition for Jordi Alba. Alaba apparently made it clear through agents and such that he was interested in a move to Barcelona. The move would provide Barcelona with one of the more experienced and versatile players in Europe. Alaba can play left-back of course, but also maintains the flexibility to play centre-back or even defensive midfield in a pinch. “The player is interested in coming,” a source at Barcelona told ESPN FC. “It’s a complicated operation, but not an impossible one.” Since Barcelona have yet to bolster much of anything on the back line, this level of flexibility would be massive. Bayern’s interest in Ousmane Dembele could make this easier, but since Barcelona wish to hang onto Dembele this will likely remain a complicated operation.

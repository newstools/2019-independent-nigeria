Awka – Jide Ikeako, the Managing Director of the Anambra State Investment and Promotion Agency, has said that the state government encourages local industrialists and manufacturers. He stated this at the weekend during the Annual General Meeting of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) held in Agulu in Anaocha Local Government Area of the state. He said Governor Willie Obiano recognized the urgent need for investors to thrive in the state, which according to him, was the reason the state government had ensured a conducive and congenial business environment with power, security, logistics and a host of other instruments to make them succeed. According to him, the state government has not fallen short of the expectations of investors in each of the areas mentioned above, stressing that Anambra was a safe and fertile ground for business, especially as it concerned the harmonisation of taxes and levies. Ikeako, however, maintained that Anambra State has gone ahead of other states of the federation in the area of foreign direct investments due to the policies, people as well as the operating business environment in the state, noting that the state would continue to improve on its investment profile.

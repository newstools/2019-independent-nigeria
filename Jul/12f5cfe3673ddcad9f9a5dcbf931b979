Osogbo – The senator representing Osun-East Senatorial District of Osun State, Francis Adenigba Fadahunsi, has blamed the protracted havoc caused by Fulani herdsmen in Yorubaland on the local indigenes.
Fadahunsi, while speaking at 2019 Police Community Relations Committee Week held in Osogbo, said some members of the host communities in Southwest conspire with them to cause havoc.
He said the only way out of the rampaging kidnappers and bandits is for indigenes to stop giving support to the herdsmen perpetrating this heinous act.
He maintained that the herdsmen and bandits carry out their nefarious act through the conspiracy of indigenes of host community.
Represented by Tosin Odeyemi, Fadahunsi, when asked how possible it is for a stranger to know the village more than the native, said: “Until we deal with our unruly children who are greedy and want sudden wealth, the problem will stay with us.”
Fadahunsi, who was the chairman of the occasion, delivered a paper on kidnapping and banditry. He said the traditional rulers also must be discrete in the sales of land and tame their appetite for material things that encourage the indiscriminate sales of lands to strangers who could be agents of criminals.

He also called on the federal government to equip the police and motivate them so that their job can be done with joy and ease.

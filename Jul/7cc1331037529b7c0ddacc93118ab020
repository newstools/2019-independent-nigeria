An Indian court quashed a plea seeking the removal of a blanket ban on condom advertisements on television channels from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. has sparked an online debate, According to Sputniknews.com. However, not everyone agreed about the need to promote sex education. Some netizens felt it is inappropriate to run condom ads at times when children are watching television. Such advertisements make it “uncomfortable and awkward” in front of children, they argued. One petitioner asserted that the ban should be lifted since the usage of condoms in the country is abysmally low, and efforts need to be taken to ensure awareness about the use of condoms, and the protection they offer to the general public. Earlier in 2017, the Indian Ministry of Information & Broadcasting had passed an order to ban condom advertisements between 6 am and 10 pm finding them “indecent especially for children”.

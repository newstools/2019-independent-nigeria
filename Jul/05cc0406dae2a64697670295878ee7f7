South Africa kept their hopes alive of progressing to theknockout stages of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations with a slender victory overNamibia and must now look for a positive result against Morocco. With sixpoints in two matches, Morocco will be a hard nut to crack for the formerapartheid enclave. The South Africans had the better chances throughout thegame against Namibia and created a lot more in front of goal than theiropponents but it took them until the 68th minutes to finally breakthe deadlock when Bongani Zungu found the back of the net. That win places South Africa on three points after they losttheir opening game to Ivory Coast but a win over already-qualified Moroccowould see them progress and they will be hoping to have midfielder Dean Furmanback after he missed out against Namibia due to a knock to his knee. Morocco secured a vital victory in their pivotal clash withGroup D rivals Ivory Coast as they did enough to narrowly defeat them andsecure their spot in the last 16 of the Africa Cup of Nations. In a closely-fought game, both teams were evenly matched forlong periods but Moroccoâ€™s Youssef En-Nesyri scored the only goal of the gameafter some good work in the build-up from Nordin Amrabat. Morocco may look to give some of their fringe players somegame time for this final game but will be wary that they could still end up aslow as third place despite already qualifying for the knockout stages. Morocco have already secured their spot in the last 16 ofthe Africa Cup of Nations and South Africa will be hoping to join them but needa positive result against them here. They must improve on their first two efforts against theMoroccans or face an early exit but may be boosted by Morocco opting to rotatetheir side. However, those players who potentially come into the side will havea point to prove and they can help their country maintain their perfect recordin the group stage.

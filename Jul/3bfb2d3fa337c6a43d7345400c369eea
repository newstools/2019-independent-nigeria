BAUCHI – No fewer than12 persons awaiting trial across five prisons in Misau, Katagum, Azare, Jama’are and Ningi local government areas of Sauchi State yesterday were released by the state Chief Judge, Justice Rabi Umar. The Chief Judge, who was on a routine visit to review cases of persons awaiting tri­al in the five local government areas of the state as part of the efforts to decongest pris­ons in the state, expressed dis­may that the prisoners were left to languish in prisons for bailable offences. Daily Independent reports that five of the six prisoners released at the Jama’are Me­dium Prison were charged with alleged witchcraft. In Misau and Azare, six persons awaiting trial were set free while two persons in Katagum and Ningi local gov­ernments, who were accused of owing debts ranging from N10,000 to N25,000 were set free and their debts settled by the Chief Judge. At Azare prison, two pris­oners were released on bail courtesy of Justice Rabi, who also directed the transfer of five other cases from Upper Area Court 1 to 11. The Chief Judge further directed the transfer of some cases that were not within the jurisdiction of Sharia courts to Bauchi for adjudi­cation even as she decried the nonchalant attitude of some sharia court judges, who were served with prior notice of her visit, but failed to turn up, a situation which pre­vented her from adjudicating on some cases at the review sittings in the prisons visited.

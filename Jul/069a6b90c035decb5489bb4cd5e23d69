Nigeria has urged member states of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to employ commitment and political will in the implementation of labour policies and programmes in the sub-region. William Alo, the Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment, at the weekend made the call at the Meeting of Ministers in Charge of Labour and Employment in the ECOWAS sub-region in Abuja. He noted that the sub-region needed renewed commitment and passion to drive the tenets of decent work and other labour policies. According to him, “We cannot continue to be paying lip service to issues of labour administration in the sub-region. The time has come for us to make a radical departure from the past if we are to bequeath onto future generation an ECOWAS sub-region that prides itself in the attainment of the tenets of decent work.” He hoped that the Meeting would approve all the proposals presented by the General Assembly, and then go back home to transform them into programmes of action to deepen decent work in the sub-region. The Meeting of Labour Experts/General Assembly of ECOWAS Social Dialogue Forum, which held from 16th – 18th July in Abuja was convened to review, validate and adopt key policy texts on labour and employment; build consensus on topical issues, amongst others. Mr. William Alo, the Permanent Secretary pledged the continued support of Nigeria to the ECOWAS Commission in its determination in addressing knotty employment and labour issues in the sub-region.

Wolverhampton Wanderers will have to beat some of the biggest clubs in the world to sign Ruben Dias from Benfica, according to reports in Portugal, According to Birminghammail.co.uk. Express & Star claimed on Friday night that Wolves were chasing the signature of the Portugal international, who is one of the highest rated defenders in European football. Now Portuguese news outlet Record (via Sport Witness ) has tried to give an update on the Benfica defender’s situation. If Wolves are to pull off what will arguably be their most audacious signing of the Fosun era, they will have to overcome some formidable opposition. Record list Manchester United, Arsenal and Real Madrid as competition for the signature of Dias, who has a release clause of €66m in his contract. The report also suggests that the Lisbon club are looking to raise that release clause in the 22-year-old’s contract to around €100m. Benfica do have a very recent history of getting money for their youngest and best stars. Dias’ former team-mate Joao Felix was eventually sold for £113m to Atletico Madrid earlier this summer. Wolves have also been linked with a move for AC Milan striker Patrick Cutrone, who is set to fly to the United States with the Rossoneri on their pre-season tour. Nuno Espirito Santo’s side are now less than a week away from their Europa League opener with Crusaders, but did close out their pre-season tour of China by beating Manchester City on penalties.

Lagosians were very happy when Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu directed men of the Lagos State Public Works Corporation to commence the immediate fixing of potholes on major roads in the state. Major roads like Iju-Ishaga, Old Abeokuta Road, Ikotun-Ijegun, Oke-Afa/Ejigbo Road, among others, have been in very bad condition before former governor Akinwunmi Ambode departure from office. Sanwo-Olu, during the electioneering campaigns, promised to fix all bad roads across the state. Sometime in June, the governor promised to release hotlines, which residents could call to get potholes in their domains fixed. Few days ago, to the admiration of motorists and commuters alike, the Lagos State Public Works Corporation commenced work on the Iju Road inwards Pen Cinema. Though it affected free flow of traffic, but the people were happy to see that the road was getting fixed. As at press time, workers have gone to sleep on the road as men of the agency left the road uncompleted after fixing up to the NNPC Filling Station. Everyone knows that the whole stretch of Iju Road, right from Fagba down to Pen Cinema, has been in a terrible state. So, many have been wondering why the repair work has to stop abruptly. Mr. Governor, you may not know about this. The remaining portions are begging for your attention.

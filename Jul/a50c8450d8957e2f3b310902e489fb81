Real Madrid signed Hazard in a marque transfer worth up to £130 million. He enjoyed a glittering career in England with Chelsea, but he’ll now call Madrid home, According to Sportbible.com. Hazard has excited Zinedine Zidane and fans alike following his performances in training. However, Marcelo doesn’t think he’s better than Neymar. “Eden’s a top player,” Marcelo said in a recent interview. “A player of high quality and, like Neymar, has the quality to be in the top five. “He’s impressive, you cannot compare them, but Neymar is better for me. “Neymar is an unpredictable player, very difficult to control. When the defender has imagined a movement to anticipate, he has already thought of another, and this is impossible to defend. “Having Neymar in Real Madrid would be a huge pleasure, but I’m not the one who decides. Neymar is a great player and Real Madrid always has to do everything to bring the best players in the world,” he added. Neymar continues to attract interest from Barcelona in view to a sensational return to Spain after initial interest from Real Madrid. The Brazilian attacker has spent just two seasons in Paris but his days in the French capital appear to be numbered.

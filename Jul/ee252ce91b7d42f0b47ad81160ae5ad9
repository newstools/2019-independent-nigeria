Law enforcement tells TMZ Sports … Uso was speeding when an officer got behind him and noticed he was driving erratically and “swerving left and right.”
We’re told when the cop pulled the wrestler over, he reeked of alcohol … and when the officer tried to administer DUI tests on Uso, he refused.
Uso was then arrested on a DUI charge and we’re told he was also hit with a speeding citation.
WWE superstar Jimmy Uso was arrested for driving under the influence near Pensacola, Florida early Thursday morning … TMZ Sports has learned. Details surrounding the arrest are unclear but here’s what we know so far — the 33-year-old was booked at 3:04 AM and the charge on the police website says DUI — driving with an unlawful blood alcohol level. Unclear what cops say Uso’s BAC was at the time of the arrest — we’re working on it. Cops say Uso — real name Jonathan Fatu — is still behind bars. His bond was set at $1,000. WWE has been in Florida this week — ‘Raw’ was in Tampa on Monday, ‘Smackdown’ was in Miami on Tuesday. Uso has a history with the law … back in February, Jimmy was arrested after allegedly getting into a drunken dispute with cops in Detroit. They claim Jimmy “squared up” as if he was going to fight the police. He was arrested for disorderly conduct and obstruction. In fact, just on Monday, John Cena clowned Uso’s mug shot from his February arrest during ‘Raw’ … and Uso was smiling about it. Uso is WWE royalty — he’s the son of WWE Hall of Famer Rikishi and he’s married to WWE superstar Naomi. He’s also one half of the famous Uso Brothers tag team with his brother, Jey Uso. The Uso Brothers are 6-time WWE tag team champs.

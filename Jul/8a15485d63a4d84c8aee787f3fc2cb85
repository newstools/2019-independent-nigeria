LAGOS – Pastor Bassey James, a renowned criminologist and President of Southern Youths Development Forum, has accused the United Kingdom (UK) of acting in bad faith by tagging Akwa-Ibom State as security risk.
James was reacting to a recent warning by the UK government which advised her citizens not to travel to 21 states in Nigeria including Akwa-Ibom State, because of kidnappings, terrorism, militancy, and diseases.
In the statement posted on its website and updated on June 17, 2019, the UK’s Foreign and Commonwealth Office said frequent attacks by the terrorist sect, Boko Haram, in the restive north-eastern region of Nigeria, raids by armed bandits in the northwest and north-central states, kidnappings across Nigeria, fatal diseases like Ebola and Lassa fever and militancy in the south-south, have made Nigeria a dangerous destination for the rest of the world with other 20 states in Nigeria which the UK had placed under travel ban for her citizens.
James, who spoke to journalists in Lagos yesterday, said it is saddening that the government of the UK could place such a blanket ban, without getting proper information from Mobil Oil Prodrucing, a multinational oil company which is domicile in the state and still doing business in Akwa-Ibom.
His words, “The travel ban on Akwa-Ibom State is very embarrassing; it’s uncalled for, especially when it is not done in good faith. “Mobil Oil Producing is domicile in Akwa-Ibom State. The company has not complained of any security treat. In fact, the company is making more money and both white and black men from all over the world come to Akwa-Ibom State.” James added that Mobil foreign partners are still producing and getting revenue from Akwa-Ibom simply because the state is quite safe.

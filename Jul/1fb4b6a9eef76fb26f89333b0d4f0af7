LAGOS – Timi Frank, activist and former Deputy National Publicity Secretary of All Progressives Congress (APC), has described the ministerial list sent by President Muhammadu Buhari to the Senate for screening as a big disappointment to Nigeria, requesting the upper chamber of National Assembly to reject 70 percent the of nominees.
The Bayelsa-born activist had in a statement made available to DAILY INDEPENDENT on Wednesday stated that President Muhammadu Buhari had told Nigerians that he would only nominate people well known to him as ministers. He said that the list before the Senate was a proof to Nigerians and the international community that the President would continue to associate with characters that had looted the nation’s
resources in the past. Frank said, “The current ministerial list is a direct confirmation that Buhari does not only court corrupt individuals but also wines and dines with known corrupt personalities. It is clear that some prominent names on the list have at one time or the other been guests of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to answer corruption charges while some still have pending corruption
cases in court. “The ministerial list is a further confirmation of president Buhari’s insincerity and incompetence. If Buhari has integrity as often claimed, most of the names that populated his new ministerial list would by now be in jail. However, he rewards and celebrates looters. Buhari must stop his pretence about fighting corruption. The list shows that he supports corruption and corrupt persons in his government and the
country,” he said. The politician said that the Senate should be patriotic and guided by conscience in rejecting about 70 percent of the nominees based on incompetence and past corruption records. He maintained that Nigerians would have confidence in the ability of the ninth Senate to act in the national interest if it worked in the interest of the nation by rejecting majority of the nominees.

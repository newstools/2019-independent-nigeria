LAGOS – Musicians have led a protest on Monday at Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) , Redemption camp, along Lagos-Ibadan expressway, against Pastor Enoch Adeboye for failure to speak against the killings of Christians across the country by herdsmen and other criminals.
The protesters, led by Eedris Adbulkarim and Baba Frayo Denge, alleged that the continued silence of Pastor Adeboye, the General Overseer of the church over the killings of Christians in the country was a tactical support for President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, who, according them, is a pastor of the church.
The placard-carrying protestors had accused Pastor Adeboye of shielding the truth because he wanted to protect his spiritual son, Osinbajo, at the expense of the blood of many Christians who according to them were being murdered every day.
They had called on the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) to suspend the highly respected pastor for failure to speak in the face of intimidation and killing of Christians across the country.
They questioned the responsibility of the man of God as the mouth piece of God for having failed to lend his voice to the call by concerned Nigerians to request that the Federal Government procured the release of Leah Sharibu from her abductors as tantamount to failure of governance and lack of concern for lives of the citizens.
They maintained Adeboye had faulted by dissociating himself from the prophecy of Pastor Bosun on the Islamisation of Nigeria.

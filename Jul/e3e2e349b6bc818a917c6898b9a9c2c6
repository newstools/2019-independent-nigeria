Atletico Madrid have confirmed that Manchester City have paid the €70m release clause for midfielder Rodri. The 23-year-old joined Atletico from Villarreal last summer for a fee around €20m, with €5m in add-ons. After a successful year at the Wanda Metropolitano, Pep Guardiola is said to have identified the Spain international as an ideal long-term replacement for Fernandinho. Rodri will become City’s most expensive player ever, eclipsing the £60m paid for Riyad Mahrez last summer by £2.8m.

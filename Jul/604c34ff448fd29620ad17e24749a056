ABEOKUTA – Olakunle Oluomo, the Speaker of Ogun State House of Assembly, has assured the Egba Nation through the Abeokuta club that Moshood Abiola University of Science and Technology (MAUSTECH) would not be relocated from Egbaland as being speculated.
The speaker made the clarification while receiving the executive members of Abeokuta Club, led by Tokunbo Odebunmi, on a courtesy call at the Assembly Complex, Oke- Mosan, Abeokuta.
Oluomo said that there was nothing like relocation of the new university from Egbaland as being speculated, rather the two institutions would be accorded opportunity to co-exist to ensure smooth take off.
According to the speaker, the proposed amendment sent to the Assembly by Governor Dapo Abiodun was meant to address issues surrounding the eventual take-off of the new institution without sacrificing the academic programme of the Moshood Abiola Polytechnic.
He said the amendment sought would ensure that the students running different programmes in the old MAPOLY were allowed to conclude their academic programmes.
The speaker, in company of seven other members of the Assembly, noted that as at now, there was no accreditation of courses for the new university by the National Universities Commission (NUC).
Earlier in his presentation, president of Abeokuta Club, Odebunmi, said what happened recently on the issue of MAUTECH was as a result of communication gap between the government and Egba Nation.
He added that the club was non-partisan, consisting of responsible citizens with Governor Abiodun as its patron.
Odebunmi said the club was always in support of government policies and programmes and had no cause to go against the government.
According to him, statistics showed that less than 25 percent of applicants of the state origin secured admission into higher institutions nationwide annually, hence, the need to support the establishments of more tertiary institutions in the state.

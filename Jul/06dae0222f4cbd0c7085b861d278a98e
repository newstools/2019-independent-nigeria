Katsina – The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and Belemaoil, in collaboration with Jack-Rich Tein Foundation, have donated 400,000-litre capacity solar-powered water treatment plants in Daura and Musawa local government areas of Katsina State.
Jack Rich-Tein Jr, the president and founder of Jack-Rich foundation, while speaking at the commissioning of the projects in Daura and Musawa, said the initiative was grounded on the fact that water is a fundamental human need.
He reiterated that each citizen required at least 20 to 50 litres of clean, safe water daily for drinking, cooking and other domestic activities, hence the construction of the water treatment plant.
“We also constructed 100,000 litres water treatment plants at Daura airstrip, water treatment plant at Musawa and potable water facility with 100,000 litres capacity tanks at Central Mosque, Daura.”
While vowing to collaboration with other relevant stakeholders to execute more developmental projects in Nigeria, Rich-Tein preached oneness among Nigerians irrespective of tribal, religious and political affiliation.
Governor Aminu Belllo Masari, on his part, urged stakeholders in the councils to setup community-ownership committee to safeguard the facilities.
Masari warned that anyone found vandalising the facilities would face the wrath of the law, adding that protecting the facilities remained the core responsibility of the community members.
“Gone are the days when government properties are being destroyed by citizens. Water is life, so you most do everything humanly possible to protect these facilities. I thanked Mr. Jack Rich-Tein and NNPC for bringing these important projects in Katsina,” hei said.

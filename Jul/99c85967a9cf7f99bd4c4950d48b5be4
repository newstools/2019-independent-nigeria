ABUJA – Chinyeaka Ohaa, the FCT permanent secretary, said there was no going back on demolition of buildings on waterways in Lokogoma districts of the Federal Capital Territory.
He insisted that pulling down the structures built without approval from FCTA Department of Developmental Control should not be questioned by anybody.
He made this known on Thursday when Lokogoma District Residents/ Owners Association and the estate developer held a meeting with him in his office.
According to him, “The demolition is going to start next week and no going back about it; is better to have life than houses. FCT Administration will not forgive any of its staff that colludes with the developer without due process from FCDA.”
He said the demolition was not aimed at causing pain to those affected but to open up water channels.
The permanent secretary assured the residents that the administration would compensate those with genuine approval.
However, some residents affected by flood in the 42 housing estates at Lokogoma District in the Federal Capital Territory, led by the Lokogoma District Residents/Owners’ Association, pleaded with the authorities to take appropriate measures before commencing its planned demolition for next week.
This came as the expiration of two weeks demolition notice given to most of the house owners in the district who built on water ways will elapse in few days.
One of the residents who is a victim of the Lokogoma flood, Malam Habeeb Abdulkadir, urged the FCT Administration to consider the pains his family and others would go through before pulling down the structures.
According to him, “My house is not mark for demolition, but over nine years now, I have been facing flood problem, I have move my entire family to a new place, it is really hard for me,” he said.

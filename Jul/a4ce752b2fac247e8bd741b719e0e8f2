Is it a positive sign that Everton are being linked with a wider and wider range of players nowadays?, According to Royalbluemersey.sbnation.com. The Blues have always been renowned for having a strong youth system though they’ve had some mixed results in that effort – Jonjoe Kenny has had a hard time winning a starting spot and is out on loan for the coming season while Dominic Calvert-Lewin has done well in spells but is by no means a regular starter either. Now it appears the Blues are being linked with Dutch wonderkid Hossein Zamani who has left Ajax Amsterdam’s famed academy program. The 16-year-old forward has let his contract expire as he seeks a new challenge. Media sources have been citing Transfermarkt as saying that he has switched to Utrecht’s youth side, but the database has deleted any references they had to that move. There’s plenty of suitors for the flashy player, with Manchester City, Manchester United, Leicester City, AC Milan, Atalanta and Olympique Marseille all mentioned along with the Toffees. The Blues link undoubtedly comes from Director of Football Marcel Brands time at Ajax’s rivals PSV Eindhoven, where he likely would have seen the youngster in action. The right-footed forward prefers to play on the left where he can cut in on his stronger foot, featuring 43 times for the Ajax Under-17 side scoring six goals and one assist. Born in Iran, Zamani holds Dutch and Afghani citizenship, and has made one youth international appearance for Netherlands at the Under-15 level. Not too much else is known about him, but this is certainly one for the future and likely to join David Unsworth’s Under-23s if the Blues do go out and add him to the club this summer.

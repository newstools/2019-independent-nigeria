Chelsea could end up bringing in as much as £60M from the sale of Spanish international Alvaro Morata, whose transfer to Atletico Madrid was confirmed earlier today, According to Caughtoffside.com. It was announced earlier today via Chelsea’s official site that the Blues have reached an agreement with Atletico for the permanent transfer of Morata, and it seems like the club could end up bringing in some serious cash from the sale. According to reliable journalist Matt Law on Twitter, Frank Lampard’s side could potentially end up making £60M from the sale of Morata, news that makes the decision to sell the Spaniard look like a wise one. Morata never really managed to fit in to life in the Premier League, as the 26-year-old constantly struggled to maintain regular goal scoring form during his time at Stamford Bridge. The former Real Madrid man only managed to bag 24 goals in 72 games in all competitions for the west London club, a poor return considering how much the Blues paid to bring him to the club in the first place. Given the fact that Chelsea are currently undergoing a transfer ban, it may not make sense to some as to why the club are willing to sell players who could prove to be useful later down the line this season. However, given the fact that the club could be set to bring in as much as £60M from this sale, it seems like the right decision to make, especially seeing as the forward has hardly been in the form of his life these past few seasons.

Barcelona enquired about the possibility of signing Virgil van Dijk from Liverpool, According to Mirror.co.uk. The Dutch defender joined Liverpool in a £75m deal in January 2018 and has reached another level at Anfield. He was influential in Liverpool’s Champions League success last term and has now emerged as the favourite to win the Ballon d’Or. Van Dijk is regarded by many as the best central defender in world football and Barcelona , who were knocked out of Europe last season by Liverpool, are among his admirers. But the Spanish champions’ hopes of landing the Dutchman appear slim to none. In his weekly column , Mirror’s Chief Football Writer John Cross discusses the approach from Barcelona. “Do not expect it to happen for a moment, but Barcelona made enquiries about whether Virgil van Dijk could be tempted to leave Liverpool,” he writes. “They were quickly given short shrift by the Dutch defender’s representatives. They did not bother taking it further.” Van Dijk is yet to join up with his Liverpool teammates for pre-season after playing for Holland in the UEFA Nations League. He is due to report back to Melwood on Saturday alongside Jordan Henderson, Georginio Wijnaldum and Trent Alexander-Arnold. Van Dijk made the most of his time off with a visit to Wimbledon on Thursday. The Dutch defender was pictured watching on from the seats in Centre Court as Simona Halep and Serena Williams secured their places in the women’s final.

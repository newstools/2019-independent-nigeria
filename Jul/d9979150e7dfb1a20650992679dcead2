Some former state governors may become the worst villains of the present political dispensation, anti-corruption fight. Some of them are heading for trouble over allegations of financial misconduct while they were in the saddle. Their successors have promised them hell and are insisting that these are no empty threats. But, the former chief executives are equally fighting back. Some of them have dared their successors to go to the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) as well as the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), if they thought they have a valid case. The stage may, therefore, be set for confrontation and the question is: Who blinks? The answer is in the womb of time.

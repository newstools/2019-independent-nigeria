China sees no conditions for engaging in talks with the U.S. and Russia on nuclear arms controls, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said at a news conference on Tuesday. U.S. and Russian officials will reportedly meet in Geneva on Wednesday to talk about their visions of a new nuclear arms deal, which could involve China. Asked whether China could be drawn into such talks, Geng Shuang told reporters that “at the moment we see no basis or preconditions for China participating in such negotiations”. The spokesman added that Russia had been informed about China’s stance on trilateral nuclear talks and had repeatedly said that it understood where China was coming from. The meeting comes at a fraught moment in the history of arms control between Washington and Moscow. Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty of 1987, on the grounds of Russian violations takes effect in August over  Putin’s objections. Trump’s team has also signaled that it is not interested in renewing the New Start treaty of 2020, which expires in 19 months despite Russia’s entreaties to keep it.

Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson has joined Native Hawaiian protesters seeking to prevent the construction of a giant telescope on Hawaii’s tallest mountain. Johnson reached the protest camp on Mauna Kea as dancers performed hula and chants. The Hollywood actor, who spent part of his childhood in Honolulu, exchanged nose to nose greetings – called honi – with protesters and then went into a tent to meet elders. Johnson’s production company Seven Bucks Productions is making a movie about the life of King Kamehameha the Great, the leader who first unified the Hawaiian Islands in 1810.

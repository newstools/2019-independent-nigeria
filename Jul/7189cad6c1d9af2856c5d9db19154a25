Abuja – Zamfara State Government is seeking the support of the National Youth Service Corps for the success of its education policy. The State Governor, Dr Bello Mohammad, made the request today when he hosted the Director-General of NYSC, Brigadier General Shuaibu Ibrahim, at the Government House in Gusau. According to Mrs. Adenike Adeyemi, the Director, Press and Public Relations, the governor also said his administration had declared free education, and would need the deployment of more Corps Members to assist in its implementation. The Governor said the state, which was bedeviled by the problem of armed banditry, had started enjoying renewed peace. He further assured of his administration’s commitment to ensuring lasting peace as well as the safety of all Corps Members serving in the state. Mohammed also indicated his plan to personally assess the NYSC Orientation Camp with a view to identifying facilities that required an upgrade, and make them more conducive for Corps members. Earlier, NYSC Director-General Brigadier General Shuaibu Ibrahim had commended the state government for its support to the Scheme,  especially with its disposition to Corps Members’ welfare. The NYSC boss, who described Corps Members as leaders with great potentials, urged the State Governor to assist in the provision of befitting office accommodation for the State Secretariat of the Scheme. “Zamfara State has one of the best Orientation Camps in the country, which is a sign of the state’s commitment to the welfare of Corps Members”. “However, during my inspection visit to the camp today, my attention was drawn to some facilities that need upgrading,” he added. He assured the Governor of the Scheme’s continued support, especially through the deployment of  Corps Members to contribute to the state’s development efforts.

LAGOS – Justice Uhuegbu, lawyer and activist has called on Senator Rochas Okorocha, former governor of Imo State to answer to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) for his eight years stewardship in Imo State. The President of the Youth Arise Initiative urged the former governor to leave Governor Emeka Ihedioha out of his ordeal, saying that the governor had never been a staff of EFCC. He said that any public servant who had served the people and there was a petition written to the anti-graft agency, requesting accountability, the agency would do its job, adding that the agency couldn’t have placed its searchlight on Rochas and his family without prior investigation. Uhuegbu maintained that EFCC had the power to investigate Okorocha and his family for mismanagement and misappropriation of the funds of Imo people and stressed that it was for the same reason that Code of Conduct Bureau should have been alive to its responsibility to have ensured that the former governor declared his assets before assuming the position at the helm of affairs in the state. He pointed out that as a public servant his income and investments should be declared on assumption of office and on completion of his tenure such should not be so disproportionate as in the present case.

UYO – The leadership of the Joint Health Sector Unions (JOHESU) in Akwa Ibom State has announced suspension of its planned indefinite strike following last minute’s intervention by Governor Udom Emmanuel. JOHESU had threatened to paralyse activities in the state’s health sector to press for the implementation of the consolidated health salary structure on the claims that Akwa Ibom State was the only state in the South South and South East that has yet to implement the new salary structure for its health workers. During a meeting with the leadership of the unions in Uyo, the state capital on Thursday, however, the state government intervened to prevent the industrial action from coming into effect. Governor Emmanuel, who spoke through the state Commissioner for Labour and Manpower Planning, Prof. Victor Inoka, called on the leadership of the unions to shelve their action adding that he had mandated that action be taken to resolve all pending issues with them. “The governor has received your letter and your demands and has mandated that actions be taken to resolve your grievances,” the governor was quoted to have said. He called on the labour leaders to exercise patience and cooperate by giving government some time to sort out all issues and complaints by the state chapter of JOHESU.

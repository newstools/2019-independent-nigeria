LOKOJA – The governorship ambition of Captain Idris Wada on the platform of Peoples Democratic party (PDP) received a boost over the weekend when the Executive Councils and the delegates of the party in Ogori-Magongo Local Government Area of the state have vowed to give full support to the former governor of the state in the September 3 ,2019 delegate election. The Party Executives and Delegates gave this assurance when Captain Idris Wada visited the party to solicit for their votes in the forthcoming delegates’ election of the PDP
While giving the assurance, the Chairman of the PDP in Ogori Magongo LGA, Mr. Segun Adekunle, maintained that the party’s delegates will co-operate and fully support the aspiration of the immediate past governor.
Also speaking, Hon. Bode Ogunmola, the state Public Relations Officer (PRO), who was reelected on Saturday at the State Congress promised to mobilise the Delegates to vote en masse for Captain Idris Wada during the elections.
Earlier, Captain Wada had pointed out to the Stakeholders, delegates and the party loyalists that his mission to contest again is to restore the lost glory of the state.
He said that the people of the state had been living in untold poverty and misery since he left office three and a half years ago and called for their support to end the suffering.
He further said, “I have the requisite character to make the state to maximise its potential. The state is on quick sand and it takes an experienced person to get it back on track.” While lamenting the rot in the governance of the state as a result of ineptitude of the governor and his team, he promised to provide purposeful leadership that would restore the pride of the state.

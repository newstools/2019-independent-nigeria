The Teranga Lions of Senegal have roared to the semifinal of the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) when they defeated the Squirrels of Benin Republic 1-0 in the first quarterfinal match played at the 30 June Stadium, Cairo. Everton midfielder, Idrissa Gueye made the difference in the 70th minutes with the breakthrough. It’s a thing of Merseyside genius as Sadio Mane holds the ball up and then plays through his team mate with a beautifully-weighed pass who finishes with aplomb. With the victory, the team will play the Carthage Eagles of Tunisia or the Barea of  Madagascar for a place in the showpiece final. It is remarkable that Senegal, one of Africa’s strongest teams over the years, have never won the AFCON – but will this finally be their year?

Wycombe Wanderers have signed former Exeter winger David Wheeler on a three-year deal from QPR. The 28-year-old has signed a three-year deal and goes straight into the squad to face Bolton Wanderers on the opening day of the League 1 season at Adams Park on Saturday (k.o. 3pm). Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Chairboys manager Gareth Ainsworth said: “David was an outstanding player in an excellent Exeter City side a couple of years ago, and always caught the eye when he played against us, so we know exactly what he’s all about and I’m delighted to be able to bring him into the fold. “He’s a goalscoring midfielder who can play in a number of positions, and also a fantastic character to have around the place which is so important to our success.” Wheeler started out in non-league with Lewes and Staines Town before earning a move into the EFL with Exeter, winning their Player of the Year award in 2016/17 and catching the eye of QPR, who took him into the Championship the following season. He spent the first half of last season with Portsmouth and the second with MK Dons, scoring the winning goal on the final day of the campaign to clinch promotion to League 1. Wheeler will wear the number 7 shirt.

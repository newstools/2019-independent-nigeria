Calabar – Sixty days in office and still counting, Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State is yet to appoint the Secretary to the State Government, the Chief Security Adviser or commissioners.
Only the re-appointment of his chief of staff was announced few days after his inauguration. The Chief Press Secretary and his chief Protocol Officer were appointed after over a month in office.
The state government is running under autopilot as the governor’s whereabouts remained unknown, even as many security issues have been recorded needing his attention like communal clashes, cult activities and kidnapping among others.
Medical doctors, under the auspices of Nigeria Medical Association (NMA), Cross River State branch, had to mount a protest at both the governor’s office and the state House of Assembly over the kidnap of their member, who was the 14th member to be abducted in two years.
The medical doctor was subsequently released by the captors but the state House of Assembly, in the absence of the governor, had to wade in.
The state lawmakers, in a resolution, called on the state government to implement the anti-kidnapping law gazetted on March, 15, 2015 while also requesting the security agencies in the state to work assiduously to ensure the safe and unconditional release of Dr. Iyama Marcus and all other kidnapped victims.
The lawmakers also called on the state government to fast-track the appointment of an experienced and competent state security adviser with as a measure to curb the security challenges in the state.

Lagos – Senator Femi Okurounmu, Chairman of the Presidential Advisory Committee On The 2014 National Conference on Friday said he is not surprised by the request from President Muhammadu Buhari pleading with the leadership of the National Assembly to give him more time to compile the names of his Ministers. Speaking in a chat with Daily Independent, Okurounmu said Nigerians may have to wait for six months to get the names of the Ministers as the President is repeating the same pattern he used in 2015 when he named his cabinet after six months. On the delay, he said President Buhari and the cabal are still searching for cabinet members who will help me advance his Fulanisation agenda. “I am not surprised. He always needs more time to do everything. Since February, he has not decided his cabinet. Remember in 2015, it took him over six months before he could appoint a cabinet, so he is repeating the same pattern”. “There is a cabal surrounding him who are going to be dictating to him whom he should appoint or not, depending on who are going to be found amenable to the fulfillment of their agenda”. “Even if he is going to appoint a non-Fulani, it must be a person who is going  to be susceptible to accepting and working their own agenda. That was the same thing they did in 1999 when they decided that Olusegun Obasanjo will be the President in preference to Olu Falae”. “They wanted a Southerner who will carry out their own agenda. So, they purposely went and release Obasanjo from prison because they know he was  the man who has always danced to their tune and who they can continue to dictate to.  So, they brought him out of prison and rigged him to the Presidency” he said .

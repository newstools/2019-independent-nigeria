LAGOS – The United Kingdom Export Finance (UKEF) has entered into a strategic partnership with Nigeria’s Export-Import Bank (NEXIM) to promote investments, regional and global trade between Nigeria and the United Kingdom. Gbemi Sikuade, the Engagement and Communications Manager, West Africa, UK Department for International Trade, Nigeria, in a statement yesterday, said that the partnership will foster greater co-operation in trade through co-financing in the form of guarantees and insurance. Also, Her Majesty’s Trade Commissioner for Africa at the UK Department for International Trade, Emma Wade-Smith, noted that the export finance agency of the UK government has doubled the country’s limit for UK companies wanting to do business with Nigeria from £750m to £1.25billion. “Nigeria is the UK’s 38th largest trading partner in the world and one of our most strategically important markets on the African continent,” Wade-Smith said. “The UK’s finance-led export and investment promotion work, supported by the work of UKEF, supports more deals to drive greater value to the UK economy and is instrumental in supporting African markets, such as Nigeria to grow. That’s why I am particularly excited about this MoU agreement between UKEF and NEXIM as it demonstrates the UK government’s long-term commitment to our trading partnership with Nigeria,” she added.

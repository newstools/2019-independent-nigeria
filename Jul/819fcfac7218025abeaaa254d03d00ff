CALABAR – The Court of Appeal in Calabar, Cross River State capital, has dismissed applications from the election petition tribunal brought before it by the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and its candidates for the Central Senatorial District, Ntufam, Dr. Sandy Onor and Boki 1 Federal Constituency, Dr. Itam Abang, challenging the competence of the election tribunal to hear petitions brought before it by Senator Victor Ndoma-Egba and Sebastine Anyia of the All Progressives Congress(APC). The appeal court’s decision came a day before that of the governorship election petitions tribunal that has concluded the hearing in case number EPT/ CAL/Gov/1/2019 between Senator John Owan-Enoh versus Governor Ben Ayade and two others. The governorship election tribunal on Friday gave 22 days within which all parties in the suit are to file and reply to their addresses while fixing August 19, 2019, for the adoption of the addresses. The Appeal Court cases related to the National Assembly elections are suit numbers CA/C/NAEA/234/2019 between Ntufam Dr. Sandy Ojang Onor, Peoples’ Democratic Party PDP & Senator Victor Ndoma-Egba CON SAN & 3 Ors. The Second Appeal between Dr. Virginia Itam Abang & Sabastine Ubua Anyia & 3 Ors in Appeal No: CA/C/NAEA/233/2019. The respondents/appellants had based their grievance on the grounds that the petitioners/appellee (respondents in the Court of Appeal) filed their application for issuance of pre-hearing notice for their petitions prematurely. Both appeals, which were initially slated for hearing on July 16, 2019, were adjourned to July 18, 2019, because the appellants could not satisfy the court that the notice of appeal had been properly served on the respondents. When the first appeal (No. CA/C/ NAEA/234/2019 between Ntufam Dr. Sandy Ojang Onor & Senator Victor Ndoma-Egba CON SAN & 3 Ors) was called, the Honourable Justices of the Court of Appeal realised from the printed records of the court and from the date the tribunal’s ruling was delivered that the mandatory time frame stipulated by law for the filing and hearing of such appeals had lapsed. Counsel to the appellants, Attah Ochinke, was left with no other option than to withdraw the appeal, which was accordingly dismissed.

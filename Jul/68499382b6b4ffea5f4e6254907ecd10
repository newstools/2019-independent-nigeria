Gerard Lopez, Lille president has confirmed that a £72m agreement has been reached with Napoli for the sale of in-demand winger Nicolas Pepe. The 24-year-old scored 22 times in Ligue 1 last season – a total only bettered by Paris Saint-Germain’s Kylian Mbappe – and set up 11 more. Pepe’s form earned him links with the likes of Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool, but Napoli boss Carlo Ancelotti hinted on Thursday that his side were close to signing the Ivory Coast international. An agreement is now in place between Lille and Napoli, but personal terms must still be thrashed out. “Napoli have satisfied our request of €80m. Now it will be up to the player to decide where to go, also on the basis of other proposals that his agents received from four clubs,” Lopez told Tuttosport. “Pepe will return from his holidays on Monday and I think that he will make his mind up halfway through the week. We asked him to stay last year and promised him we would have let him go during this transfer window.” Adam Ounas is expected to make the switch to Lille as part of the agreement, according to reports in Italy

AKURE – The leadership of the youth wing of All Progressives Congress (APC) in the South West has commended Rt. Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, the Speaker, House of Representatives, on the appointment of legislators from the region into ‘juicy’ committees in the Green Chamber. A statement signed on Tuesday by Lawal Kolade, the party’s  Zonal Youth Leader in the South West which was made available to DAILY INDEPENDENT, said the list of the committee chairmen had afforded the House of Representative members from the region adequate representation in policy determination in the country’s affairs. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Lawal, who described the Speaker’s move as being calculative and accommodating in his discretion, assured that the APC youth wing in South West were comfortable with all the nominations made into the committees. While appreciating the House leadership for a commendable start in the 9th Assembly, the group also lauded them on the choice of committee chairmen and vice-chairmen, adding that the lower legislative chamber would continue to receive its support. Lawal stated: “The South West has not been favoured in chairmanship of committees in the past as in the 9th Assembly, and in the NDDC committee chairmanship. “We feel strongly that Hon Bunmi Tunji-Ojo is an experienced hand from Ondo State, an oil producing state, and very capable to deliver on the assignment without fear or favour,” he stated. Last week Thursday, Gbajabiamila had announced the names of leaders and members of committees of the House of Representatives.

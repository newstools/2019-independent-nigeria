UMUAHIA – Abia State government has announced its decision to introduce a five-year tax waiver for genuine investors in real estate to encourage them to invest in the state economy. Sir Ude Okochukwu, the state Deputy Governor, who disclosed the move in his remarks during the commissioning of an estate built in Umuahia by Dr. Nzeribe Okegbue, an indigene of the state based in Lagos,  expressed joy that the campaign by the state government on the need for indigenes of the state residing outside  to come back home and invest. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Okochukwu assured that the state government would partner with any genuine investor with the necessary incentive. He said, “Abia State is one of the safest states in the country; we are willing to give a five-year tax waiver to any investor willing to invest in the state. “I want to encourage our brothers and sisters living outside the state to partner with us to develop the state as government alone cannot develop the state; the state belongs to us all, we do not have any other state to call our own.” He commended Dr. Okegbue for finding it worthy to return home and invest, describing it as a move that should encourage others in investing in their home state if assured of protection of such investment by government. “We are impressed that Abians are responding to our call for those of those residing outside the state to come back home and develop the state, government alone cannot provide all the housing facilities without the assistance from the people. Earlier, the Estate Developer, Dr. Okegbue, said his decision to invest in his state was borne out of appeals made by the state government for indigenes of the state to return and invest and promised to attract and encourage other indigenes of the state living outside the shores of the state on the need to invest at home.

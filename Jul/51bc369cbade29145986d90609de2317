ABUJA – United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) in collaboration with the Agricultural Development Project (ADP) and the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture (IITA) has trained 300 farmers on post-harvest best practices – using hermetic storage technology in Yobe State. A statement on Thursday by Mr. Kelechi Onyemaobi, Communications Officer of WFP, explained that the training carried out by the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) in Yobe State, North East Nigeria, has improved methods of food storage after the harvest season. He further explained that hermetic storage bags are airtight and waterproof, allowing farmers to store and save grains from infestations or destruction by insects, rodents, mold and moisture, thus preserving them for long periods of time. He noted that a bag-opening ceremony recently in Gashua, Yobe State, marked the highpoint of the training which aimed to reduce the losses suffered by farmers due to improper food storage. According to figures by the Nigerian Incentive-Based Risk Sharing System for Agricultural Lending (NIRSAL), Nigeria loses some US$9 billion every year due to poor post-harvest management. More than 30 percent of staple food grains (maize, sorghum, millet) are lost due to poor storage, while 60 percent of vegetables perish. He stated that after the training, each of the farmers received eight (8) specially made airtight 50 kg bags to store their grains for six months until the prices of grains rose in the market.

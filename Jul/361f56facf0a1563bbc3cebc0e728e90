Missing out of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations was a big disappointment for Super Eagles midfielder, Ogenyi Onazi. Onazi ruptured his Achilles tendon in a Turkish Super Lig game against Rizespor in December 2018 which ruled him out of the rest of the season and the African tourney in Egypt. He has since returned to training after the six-month injury layoff, as he was captured jogging in a video. Reflecting on the injury and missing the AFCON 2019, the Trabzonspor midfielder said the situation broke him down so much, but he had to move on. “I cannot deny how I felt about it. I almost got crazy but I had to just control myself, keep training and avoid distraction to focus on my club,” he said. Nigeria emerged victorious in the third place match of the tournament after beating Tunisia 1-0 courtesy of a third minute goal by Odion Ighalo who announced his retirement from international duties after the competition.

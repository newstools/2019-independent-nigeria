Nigeria Super Eagles have moved up 12 steps in the July edition of the FIFA Rankings released on Thursday. Nigeria, who placed 45th before the start of the just concluded Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt, is now 33rd in the world and third in Africa, having garnered 1,481 points as against 1,433 it had in June. Super Eagles move was aided by their third place finish at the AFCON where they won five games and lost two. However, Nigeriaâ€™s 2-0 loss to Madagascar, surprise quarter-finalist in AFCON, has aided the South African team to also move up 12 points placing 96th in the world. Before the AFCON, Madagascar was ranked 108th. Nigeria is, however, third in Africa behind Senegal and Tunisia, who are 20th and 29th in the world, respectively.

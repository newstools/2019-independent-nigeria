Five years just passed since Conor McGregor fought Diego Brandao at UFC Fight Night 46 in Dublin, Ireland. McGregor was still and up-and-coming featherweight at that point in time, and the first-round TKO win over Brandao helped legitimatize McGregor as a forced to be reckoned with at 145lbs in the Octagon. On the fifth-year anniversary of their fight, McGregor took to social media to tell his former foe that he thinks he should be back in the UFC. Brandao was released by the UFC in 2016, and has been fighting for promotions such as RIZIN and Fight Nights Global ever since then. Here’s what McGregor said to Brandao on Twitter. “You have some phenomenal finishes in your storied career Diego, you should still be in the UFC. The lower leagues are no match! A true finisher! Happy anniversary my brother.” — Conor McGregor Since being released by the UFC, Brandao has gone just 4-3, and he is coming off of a decision loss to Marcin Held in his last fight. However, he is still putting on entertaining fights for the most part. Keep in mind that Brandao had a solid record of 6-4 in the Octagon, and even won The Ultimate Fighter. However, it should also be noted that he tested posted for marijuana for the Ortega fight, and to make matters worse was arrested for felony battery arrest a few months later. Due to all the legal troubles, the UFC decided it was better to cut him. As for McGregor, there’s still no word of a potential return opponent inside the Octagon. With Justin Gaethje and Donald Cerrone being booked for a fight recently, it took away two potential opponents for McGregor. At this point, it seems likely he will wait to see what happens between Khabib Nurmagomedov and Dustin Poirier at UFC 242.

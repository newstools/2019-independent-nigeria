He made the call on Thursday during a stakeholders’ security meeting and community policing with the theme “Policing the Community By the Community” in Lagos. At the meeting, the CP said the essence of the meeting was to deliberate on how to ensure active partnership between the police and the community in providing quality service to the people. He said that community policing would allow the police to view their primary role as providing quality service to the people as well as allow them to adopt problem solving approach in any area of the state. “Community policing will require the police involving the community in deciding policing priorities and also to promote transparency and honesty,” he said. The CP further added that part of the values of the community policing is that the police must respect and protects the rights of the citizens through demonstrable commitment in delivering best quality at all time. He also noted that citizens who are with genuine sense of grievance against the police would have effective redress and because the police are answerable to whatever they do, all officers are admonished to conform to the rule of law.

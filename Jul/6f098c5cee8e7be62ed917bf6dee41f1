Lagos – Arsenal of England midfielder, Alex Iwobi has denied speculation that he is desperate to create better marks than his talented uncle, Austin ‘Jay Jay’ Okocha enacted in his heyday with club and country, as he begged Nigerians not to compare him with the Nigerian legend. While Iwobi has been touted as the next number 10 in the Super Eagles, he insists it will only come true for him showing his best efforts on the field, not talking about emulating Okocha, or by trying to surpass all achievements of the former Nigeria captain. The former captain of Arsenal’s Under-23 team, who joined The Gunners when he was just five years old, stated further during a Sports Radio programme monitored in Lagos that he will only continue giving his best any time he is called upon, and make the best marks he can in his own way. He admitted that comparisons are bound to be made between him and ‘Jay Jay,’ considering that they are related and he is now playing from the same role in which his uncle made his marks, but stressed that it is not about competing to outshine what someone else has done. “Obviously, he’s a legend in the round leather game not only in Nigeria or Africa but in the world in general. No one can compare with him. I am only doing my own thing  the way I know how to, not because I want to compare myself with anyone, or to outdo anyone. “I will only get the best I can, in my own way, and try to help the team the best way I can. “But I cannot lie, I admire my uncle for how he played and what he did for our country; and I will try to do the best I can in my own way as well.”

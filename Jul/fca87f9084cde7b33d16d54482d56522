Mr Babatunde Fowler, Executive Chairman, Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), has urged corporate organisations to support security institutions in the discharge of their responsibilities. This was as the former Head of State, General Abdulsalami Abubakar, asked Nigerians to pray for peace, unity and development of Nigeria. Gen. Abubakar and Fowler made the calls in Zaria on Saturday at the 2018/2019 annual speech and prize giving day of the Nigerian Military School (NMS). Fowler, who commissioned the schoolâ€™s Ogundeko Hall, which was newly renovated and furnished by the FIRS, stressed the need for other corporate organisations to contribute to the development of security institutions. He said, the Armed Forces had contributed in no small measures to the security of Nigeria against external and internal aggressions. Abubakar who was the Special Guest of Honour at the event, said NMS had lived up to expectation in producing junior leaders for the Nigerian Armed Forces. While charging the graduating boys to prepare for the task ahead of them in the military career, the former Head of State asked Nigerians to pray for peace, unity and development of the country. Brig-General Mohammed Bunza, Commandant of the school, said it had maintained its old tradition of disciplined and urged graduating boys to be good ambassadors of the institution. Gen. Bunza, who highlighted the challenges of the school and efforts of the Chief of Army Staff and others to address them, expressed appreciation to Fowler for remodelling and furnishing the Ogundeko Hall.

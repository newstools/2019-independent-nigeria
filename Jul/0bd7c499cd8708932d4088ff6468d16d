BUREAU CHIEF BENIN – Academic activities were disrupted for several hours on Thursday at the Ambrose Alli University, Ekpoma as members of the University’s Chapter of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) took to the streets to protest the suspension of the union executive by the authority over alleged maladministration at the state-owned institution. The lecturers took the decision to protest their executive’s suspension at an enlarged meeting of the union after reviewing activities of the leadership of the varsity. The peaceful protest was led by Dr. Monday Igbafen and Dr. A. Aizebioje-Coker, the Chairman and Secretary of ASUU, Ambrose Alli University chapter who was allegedly suspended for trumped-up charges. They carried different placards with various inscriptions such as “Success Commeth After Struggle”, “Onimawo Leave Igbafen and ASUU Alone”, ASUU AAUE Has Lost Confidence In Onimawo And His Tyrannical Administration”, “ASUU AAUE Say No To Harassment And Intimidation”, “VC AAUE Pay Us Our Full salaries”, “Onimawo Has Murdered Sleep, You Will Sleep No More” and many others. The aggrieved ASUU members chant anti-management songs and marched through the Benin-Ekpoma- Auchi Express Road and climaxed at the main gate of the campus where they took turn to enumerate their grievances. Dr. Igbafen explained that the circumstances that led to their suspension by the Professor Ignatius Onimawo management were fabricated. According to him, “the Vice-Chancellor has been making unsubstantiated claims about us. He earlier accused me of sexual harassment and he failed and we told the whole world that it was not the chairman he wanted but the soul of our union.

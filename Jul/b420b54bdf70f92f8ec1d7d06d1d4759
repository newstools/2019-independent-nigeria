ENUGU – Enugu State chapter of All Progressive Congress (APC) has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to withdraw the nomination of Geoffrey Onyeama as minister in his new cabinet.
Dr Ben Nwoye, the State Chairman of the party made this demand while briefing journalists at APC Secretariat in Enugu on Friday.
According to Nwoye, the decision to withdraw Onyeama was taken at an emergency meeting of the State Working Committee on Thursday.
The party boss said the decision was prompted by Onyeama’s alleged involvement in election violence and his poor performance as Foreign Affairs Minister in the last dispensation.
Nwoye recalled that Onyeama used armed thugs to disrupt the last congresses of the party at his Ekeh ward and Udi LGA.
He said Onyeama visited the same brigandage on the state Congress of the party at Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium Enugu.
He said while all the dignitaries at the Congress, including former Senate President, Ken Nnamani, former Governor, Sullivan Chime and Director General of Voice of Nigeria, Osita Okechukwu, were seated, Onyeama stormed the venue with thugs, beating everybody up.
He said under Onyeama’s watch, Nigerians were maltreated in the Diaspora, especially in South Africa, adding that 118 Nigerians were killed, 13 of them by policemen in their host countries.
Nwoye regretted that Onyeama could not formulate one foreign policy to tackle the problem and any incompetent minister should not be allowed to continue in office.
He said Enugu APC had earlier appealed to the President to appoint a core, loyal, competent party member as minister from the State, which Onyeama does not represent and he should be dropped for a person who meets expectations of the party.

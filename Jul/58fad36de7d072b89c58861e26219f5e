It’s indeed a special morning in the Big Brother House today. It’s a second week and a lot has happened so far. But thank God the animosity over Coins palaver is gone and all the Housemates have now started on a clean slate. But hey, there’s a little tough talk between two Housemates earlier today. Two Fighters Just as all the Housemates are beginning to overcome the shock of the news of the eviction of two of their own, Thelma and Ella entered into a war of words this morning. When Thelma said that she was ashamed of all the BBNaija ladies for leaving the ablution area in a bad state, Ella got angry and that led to an exchange between the duo. Nineteen To Go Let’s face it, it can be hard losing people you’ve already started to get along with. We’re talking about how easy it’s going to be on the Housemates to let go of their memories of the two energetic and lively Housemates Biggie sent packing over their failure to win the Eviction Show Marble Challenge. For winning only 2 and 3 marbles respectively, Isilomo and Avala had to go. So we have 19 Housemates left And our desire to get really spiced up by them is still intact. Biggie’s House Minus Two Now that Isilomo and Avala are out of the Game, we’re waiting to see how much of their efforts in the House will be missed. Will Frodd still remember Isilomo’s warm embrace? Will Avala’s dance steps at the Saturday Party be ever forgotten? Well, let’s see what the House gets down on in the absence of the two Evicted Housemates. Morning Routine This morning the Pepper Dem Housemates worked out as they always do. We saw Seyi reeling out instructions to the Housemates. You know, keeping fit is a routine the Housemates really need, especially for the Tasks and the Games. Instructor Seyi, well done! Here’s another surprise from Biggie: the Morning exercise happened at the Arena today instead of the usual venue. What more stunts should we expect from Biggie?

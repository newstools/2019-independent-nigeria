LAGOS – Nigeria’s rich maritime resources represent a vi­tal economic safeguard and vehicle for the suc­cessful implementation of the President Muhamma­du Buhari government’s Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP), which should be sustain­ably tapped, Speaker of the House of Representa­tives, Femi Gbajabiamila, has stated. Gbajabiamila said this on Thursday in Lagos at a cere­mony hosted by the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMA­SA) to mark this year’s African Day of Seas and Oceans, with the theme, “Harnessing Nigeria’s Ma­rine Biodiversity for Accel­erated Economic Growth.” Speaking on the theme, which echoed the African Union (AU) subject for the 2019 African Day of Seas and Oceans, “Enhancing Africa’s Role in a Globally Binding Instrument on Ma­rine Biological Diversity in Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction”, the Speaker pledged that the legisla­ture would support efforts by the executive to ensure sustainable management of the country’s vast ma­rine resources. That was as the Direc­tor-General of NIMASA, Dr. Dakuku Peterside, dis­closed that the agency had sent to the Federal Gov­ernment for ratification six International Mari­time Organisation (IMO) instruments as part of ef­forts to ensure sustainable management of the marine environment.

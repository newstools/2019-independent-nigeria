Speaking to reporters before leaving for Bosnia, Erdogan wouldn’t say, however, when the Russian missile defense system would reach their destination. Erdogan said: The preparations for the journey, the loading (of the S-400) is continuing … The S-400 will arrive by planes. May it be beneficial for our country, our region and especially for the world. Local media outlet Ahval reported the initial S-400 delivery has been sent on two cargo planes from a Russian military base, and a Russian technical team is set to arrive in Turkey to oversee installation. Washington has previously told its NATO ally that Ankara’s adoption of Russian S-400 missile technology alongside U.S. F-35 fighters was incompatible and would endanger Western defence. The S-400 is the latest generation surface-to-air defense system developed by Russia as a rival for America’s own Patriot weaponry and is considered by NATO countries to pose a threat to their combined air operations. The S-400 missiles are not interoperable with the technology NATO countries use, as the alliance requires. The United States suspended the delivery of F-35 warplane-related equipment to Turkey in April until Ankara ditched the Russian deal, which now appears unlikely. “We have . . . been clear that acquisition of the [Russian] S-400 is not compatible with the F-35,” Lt. Col. Mike Andrews, a Department of Defense (DOD) spokesman declared in a statement, according to the Washington Post. “We very much regret the current situation . . . but the DOD is taking prudent steps to protect the shared investments made in our critical technology.”

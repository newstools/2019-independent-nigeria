Lagos – Super Eagles striker and 32nd Africa Cup of Nations Top Scorer with five goals, Odion Ighalo is the only Nigerian that made the tournament CAF team. After the tournament won by Algeria following their 1-0 defeat of Senegal on Friday night, Ighalo was named alongside Riyad Mahrez (Algeria) and Sadio Mane (Senegal) as the three forwards in a 4-3-3 formation. Owever, the Nigerian has ended his international career with the team due to abuses on social media. He was quoted as telling coach Gernot Rohr that his young family was suffering from the many abuses on social media. The three midfielders CAF named are Adlene Guediora (Algeria), Idrissa Gana Gueye (Senegal) and Ismael Bennacer (Algeria). The four defenders are Lamine Gassama (Senegal), Yassine Meriah (Tunisia), Youssouf Sabaly (Senegal) and Kalidou Koulibaly (Senegal). Algeria goalkeeper, Rais M’Bolhi is the team’s goalkeeper. The tournament most valuable player is Algerian Ismael Bennacer  with Rais M’Bolhi receiving the tournament’s best goalkeeper award. Senegalese Krepin Diatta got the young player award with his team winning the fair play award. Algeria coach, Djamel Belmadi won the best coach award. However, Ighalo has refused to reverse his decision to retire despite entreaties from the President of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) Amaju Pinnick. Pinnick through Osasu Obayiuwana has said the player has reversed his decision. “I have had a chat with him and he has reversed this decision. He has been under a lot of pressure from his Chinese club. But everything is now fine and he shall continue with the national team.” But Ighalo, who has been quoted by the same source, refutes the FA President’s insistence he had reversed his international retirement. “My decision to retire from the @NGSuperEagles stands. But the NFF President has spoken to me, to reverse the retirement. Out of respect, for him and his position, I have had to listen to him. But I have not changed my position yet.”

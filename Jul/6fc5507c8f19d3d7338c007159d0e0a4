YENAGOA – Gboribiogha Jonah, Bayelsa State deputy governor, has expressed strong desire to sustain the developmental strides of Governor Seriake Dickson if he becomes the governor.
Jonah, a governorship aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state’s governorship election slated for November 16, said he would also speak on behalf of the people.
Jonah, who had collected the expression of interest and nomination forms at the PDP national secretariat in Abuja, told reporters that he had been a key player in the Dickson administration from its inception in 2012, and had understudied the governor.
A statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media, Ebi Evinson, quoted him as stating that the driving force behind his ambition was the passion to serve the people.
He said the past seven years had afforded him the opportunity to clearly understand the challenges of governance, which had placed him in a better position to consolidate on Dickson’s achievements, especially in education and health sectors.
The deputy governor urged the PDP to provide a level playing ground for all aspirants and play by the rules, adding that there should be no preferred aspirants to avoid divisiveness within the party’s ranks.
Colonel Austin Akubundu (rtd), PDP’s National Organising Secretary, who handed over the forms to the deputy governor, promised to ensure a seamless transition in Bayelsa State, assuring him that the party would provide a level playing ground for all aspirants.
He said he was satisfied with the credentials of all the aspirants for the Bayelsa governorship as they were eminently qualified to run for the office of governor.
Among those who accompanied the deputy governor were Tonye Isenah, Speaker, Bayelsa State House of Assembly; Abraham Ingobere, Deputy Speaker; elder statesmen like Francis Doukpola, Thompson Okorotie and Martin Agbede, and numerous supporters.

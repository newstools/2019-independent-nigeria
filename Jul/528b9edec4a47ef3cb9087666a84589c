Bauchi – Members of the All Progressive Congress (APC) in Bauchi State under the aegis of ‘Concerned APC Youth’ have given Governor Bala Mohammed a one-week ultimatum to disclose the total amount of money he pays to the state and local government workers as monthly salaries.
Spokesperson of the group, Malam Mukhtar Jibril, gave the charge on Wednesday while addressing journalists in Bauchi.
He said the call became because the governor had during campaign alleged that the previous government used to siphon N1.9 billion monthly during payment of salaries.
“We did not forget how the present governor used to allege during his campaigns that he past APC government put ghost workers on the state payroll and stole whooping sum of N1.9 billion monthly. Therefore, we call on him to tell the world the exact amount of money being paid to state and local governments workers as monthly salaries.
“The new government has started paying salaries now. So we need to know how much is the salary so that people can know if the accusations that salaries were inflated by the past government were true or false,” he challenged.
Jibril also queried why the governor allegedly claimed to have spent about N6 billion for payment of last month’s salaries as against the N5 billion his predecessor used to expend ‘despite the fact that he does not have political appointees yet to pay’.
He threatened that if Governor Bala did not make the actual monthly salaries of the state known in week, the group would sue him over claims.
“We, the APC youth in the state will not condone the levelling of false allegations against our party leaders by the PDP and Governor Bala Mohammed. We will continue to challenge and expose their mischief. Recently, I refuted their false claim that the former governor spent N2.3 billion on burial of dead people. The actual amount was N1.2 billion which was expended in the last four years in the 20 local governments of the state,” he said.

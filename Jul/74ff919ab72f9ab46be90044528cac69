Lagos – In what looked like an upset, Madagascar defeated Nigeria 2-0 in the last Group B match of the ongoing 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). The Madagascan took the lead as early as the 13th minute as a costly defensive error from Leon Balogun gifted Lalaina Nomenjanahary an easy ball that beat Ikechukwu Ezenwa for that curtain raiser. The wastefulness of the Super Eagles continued as they continued to put every foot wrong in front of Madagascan vital area, with Ahmed Musa missing a sitter in the dying minutes of the first half as he had goalkeeper of Madagascar to beat but chose to dribble and then missed the chance. Meanwhile, as Nigeria continued to play shy in front of goals, a deflected free kick shot by Wilfred Ndidi in the 56th minute beat Ezenwa for Madagascan second goal of the night. With the result, Madagascar, who are yet to lose a game in the ongoing AFCON, took their points haul to seven and thus top Group B with that number of points as against Nigeria’s six points. Consequently, the Super Eagles will like face the Indomitable Lions of Cameroon or the Black Stars of Ghana in the next round. This is according to the fixtures earlier made available by the Confederation of Africa Football (CAF). According to the fixtures, the runners up of Group B will come up against the runners up of Group F. In Group F, Cameroon lead by four points while Ghana are second with two points, even as Benin Republic are also second on two points. In their final group game coming up tomorrow, Ghana will come up against one-point Guinea Bissau while Cameroon will play Benin Republic. In the event that Ghana expectedly defeat Guinea Bissau and Cameroon win Benin Republic, the status quo in the group will remain, meaning that Nigeria will face Ghana in the Round of 16.

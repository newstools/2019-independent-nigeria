ADO-EKITI – Dr. Kayode Fayemi, Ekiti State Governor, has said that the farmer-herder conflict has become a threat to sub-regional and continental peace and stability, lamenting it is costing the country $14 billion annually. Fayemi, who is Chairman of the Nigerian Governors’ Forum (NGF), said a similar problem is prevalent in other West African countries, which led to the adoption of a Regional Transhumance Policy as far back as 1998. Lamenting that Nigeria loses $14 Billion annually to farmer-herder clashes, the Governor said it’s a development that may also have devastating effect on the country’s ability to guarantee food security for the people. He therefore called for the enactment of appropriate states and federal legislations and strategies that would help to regulate incessant cases of farmer-herder conflicts and the attendant loss of lives and properties in the country. He also canvassed the need for effective and strategic communication of government policies on this and other national issues in order to ensure that the right messaging reach the citizenry and save the country from avoidable crises. Delivering a paper titled, “Farmer-Herder Conflicts in Nigeria: Implications for National Security,” at the National Institute for Security Studies (NISS) Executive Management Course in Abuja on Thursday, Governor Fayemi stressed that the scale of the challenge required that government should move to unpack what has become a major threat to peaceful coexistence and food security in the country. He noted that fatalities recorded from the farmer-herder clashes outnumber those of the devastating insurgency in the North East and had led to the loss of more lives in Nigeria than in the rest of West Africa. Dr Fayemi, who advocated for state and federal laws that would foster peaceful coexistence in spite of the nation’s diversity, stated that such legislations on regulating the conduct of farmers and herders must have a human face and must help in harnessing the country’s economic and socio-cultural potentials.

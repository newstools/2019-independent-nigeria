Family members, friends and professional colleagues of ailing veteran sports journalist Akinloye Oyebanji on Thursday appealed to governments, public-spirited individuals and corporate organisations to assist him with the sum of $25,000. Steve Olarinoye, a retired sports administrator, who spoke on behalf of the group, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ilorin that the money was needed for urgent medical attention. Olarinoye, a former Zonal Director of the Federal Ministry of Youths and Sports, disclosed that Oyebanji was critically ill with persistent heart failure. “He is presently at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the National Hospital in Abuja. But the money needed will be for his transportation and treatment in India, and there will be two caretakers who will accompany him to India,’’ he said.

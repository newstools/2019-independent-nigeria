Lagos – Some members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) have called for a quick and credible replacement of vacant national offices in the party’s leadership. The party members, under the auspice of ‘The 2018 APC Convention Contestants’ Forum’, in a letter to the National Chairman, Adams Oshiomle, and National Leader, Bola Tinubu on Monday, said that members of the party who should fill such vacant positions must fulfill laid down procedures as enshrined in the APC constitution to occupy such offices.
The letter, signed by the forum’s secretary Frank Ossai, said such persons must have indicated interest in serving the party, “obtained the nomination form, undergone the screening processes of the convention, paid the specified fees and canvassed for votes, and particularly must have been adjudged to be qualified and fit to occupy elective positions during the 2018 elective Convention.“
Ossai noted that it would be against the principles of equity and the spirit of true patriotism on which the party stands to sideline and marginalise a candidate and member of the party who lawfully participated in an electoral process, painstakingly passed through all its rigors, and eventually came second after the declared winner, at the time when the seat he vied for becomes vacant.
“A great instance is that of the former National Secretary of the party, His Excellency Mai Mala Buni, who left his former position to contest for the governorship seat of Yobe State and thus, his seat at the National Secretariat became vacant.
“The party’s decision to retain his deputy as acting National Secretary is commendable and widely acceptable. However, the position should be given to persons that contested for the office of the National Secretary at the 2018 APC National Convention.
“The case of Barrister Inuwa Abdulkadir, the sacked National Vice Chairman (North West) who was expelled by the party for anti-party activities and his continuous unrepentant disposition to caution is there and it is our expectation and appeal that such a vacant position be meritoriously allocated to whoever is next in line or in pole position to take over,“ Ossai said in the letter.
The letter further reads that the APC has set earlier precedents in addition to a plethora of cases affecting wherein an office becomes vacant.

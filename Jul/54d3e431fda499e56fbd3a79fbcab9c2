GOMBE – Vice-Chancellor of the Gombe State University, Professor Ibrahim Musa Umar has described the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFUND) as a major pillar towards the development of the University.
He said the intervention of TETFUND has led the African Development Bank to select the University’s Information Communication Technology (ICT) centre to be among the four in Nigeria to be a centre of excellence for training.
He stated this during the commissioning ceremony of the ICT and the Faculty of Science Complexes by the Executive Secretary of TETFUND, Professor Suleiman Elias Bogoro.
Professor Ibrahim Musa Umar, who put the cost of the project at N3 billion, added that work was already going on in the construction of the Faculty of Education, Faculty of Arts, Social and Management Science and 10 lecture theatres while another project for the construction of the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences was also ongoing.
According to him, “Today we are commissioning two projects initiated by Professor Suleiman Bogoro. I must say that these two projects, hardly can you find Faculty of science with seven departments under the same roof. And all these departments, you have all the things you require, all in one place.
“The ICT facility definitely is one of the best. This facility is being selected by the African Development Bank to be a Centre for training among other four Universities in Nigeria,” Professor Bogoro said.
Commissioning the Projects, Professor Suleiman Elias Bogoro, commended the judicious use of funds released to the Gombe State University adding that he was amazed seeing the value for money released from TETFUND.
“We are all amazed with even the infrastructure that we funded. There are some moments you release money and you are not seeing value for the money immediately. I can tell you, at the Gombe State University, we saw value for money that we release from TETFUND,” Professor Bogoro said.

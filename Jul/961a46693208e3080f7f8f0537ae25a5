Jos  – Governor Simon Lalong, has approved the engagement of Boston Consulting Group (BCG) to work with the State Government in collaboration with H. Pierson Associates Limited to produce a detailed five-year strategic development plan for Plateau state  between  2019 and 2024. BCG is a global management consulting firm and the world’s leading advisor on business strategy with more than 90 offices in 50 countries including Nigeria, employing more than 14,000 employees with more than 900 partners. A statement made available by  Ezekiel Gomos, chairman Plateau state economic team made available to Daily Independent in Jo,explained that  the plan would  provide a roadmap  for the state. The process will commence with interactive sessions with all   ministies,departments and agencies  and select stakeholders in the state development arena, followed by a deep diagnosis of the past and current development efforts, leveraging on existing and future development programs around Nigeria. According to the statement,this will also entail conducting a deep-dive of the prioritized development sectors and a clear identification and collation of the state resources- from natural endowments to the State’s financial situation, as well as bench-marking of similar states to Plateau. The project which will last for eight  weeks will culminate in the delivery of a strategy document that lays out clear Monitoring and Evaluation matrix for each sector/MDA and also include appropriate training and capacity building of key actors from the public service to enhance implementation of the plan. Accepting the appointment, BCG’s  representative and head of Nigeria office, Dr Jaoa Hrotko, assured Governor Lalong that  his group  will deploy its network of experience, expertise and global linkages not only to deliver a realistic and actionable plan but  to also work with the government to provide a quick positive narrative in  the state.

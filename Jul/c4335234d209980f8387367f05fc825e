With Video Assistant Referees (VAR) will debut at the quarter-finals of the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt with the match officials preparing feverishly for its usage. Since the beginning the tournament, there has been mock tests of VAR during selected matches, which gave the match officials a practical feel of the system which is expected to enhance officiating at the flagship continental event. The quarter-final clash between Senegal and Benin will go into the history as the first ever game at the AFCON finals with VAR. IFAB Technical Director, David Elleray, who has been supervising the VAR training sessions at the Military Academy Stadium in Cairo, has lauded the decision to have the system for the remainder of the competition. “CAF is being sensible for introducing VAR at the quarter-finals of the Africa Cup of Nations. This is a critical stage of the competition and there are key matches. It is better to have quality in terms of decision making and VAR will help do that,” Elleray told CAFOnline.com. “We have been working on this since April 2018. It has been a process and with the support of CAF Instructors. We are satisfied so far with the preparations and we are training every day to get better.” In a related development, two Europeans referees have been brought on board to support the VAR system based on their experience and familiarity with the latter. They are Paulinus Van Boekel (Netherlands) and Benoit Millot (France).

The 27-year-old start just celebrated her birthday in Italy and is now reportedly full-steam ahead with planning her comeback, and we honestly can’t wait to see it. ‘Selena is in a really good place,’ a source told Entertainment Tonight. ‘She just celebrated her birthday in Italy and is really enjoying this time off before things ramp up again.’ On top of that, the star’s latest work is said to be some of the most personal she’s ever created, with her 2015 follow up promising to be some of her best yet. ‘Selena has gone through a lot over the years and is ready to share it with the world,’ the source added. The former Disney star has recently returned to the big screen with her role in The Dead Don’t Die – making her Cannes Film Festival debut in the process. Her last official album release was in 2015, and since then she’s taken a step back to deal with issues including her rehab stint, public break-ups with Justin Bieber and The Weekend , and a life-saving kidney transplant.

Since then, Selena has been fairing better than ever, and revealed part of that was down to stepping back from social media, which she thinks has damaged younger generations. ‘For my generation specifically, social media has been terrible,’ she said. ‘I understand that it’s amazing to use as a platform but it does scare me when you see how exposed these young girls and boys are. I think it’s dangerous for sure.’

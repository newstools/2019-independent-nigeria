LAGOS – Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr, says the team is now focused on winning the third place match on Wednesday. The Super Eagles lost 2-1 to the Desert Foxes of Algeria in the second semifinal on Sunday. William Troost- Ekong scored and own goal to hand Algeria the lead, which was cancelled through Odion Ighalo’s penalty but a stoppage time free kick by Riyad Mahrez condemned Nigeria to that defeat. Rohr now said that they have put the loss behind them and will now give their all in the losers final so that we won’t go home empty handed. Rohr Said “Obviously, my players were preparing for extra-time, but that is football, you cannot always win. The focus is now on the third-place match, we will try our best to bow out of Egypt on a high,” he said.” Nigeria has won the Africa Cup of Nations three times in 1980, 1994 and 2013 while Algeria is solitary winners which they achieved on home soil in 1990. In their previous meetings, Nigeria has had marginal advantage.

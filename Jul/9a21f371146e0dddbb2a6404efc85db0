I spoke to Dean Kiely and he said: ‘Do you fancy coming in and having the opportunity to work with the lads?’ Obviously it’s a no-brainer and I jumped at the opportunity. “Training [on Friday] was absolutely excellent. The goalkeepers are at a very high standard which is what I expected so I’m just going to take it all in and learn from them and try to support them as best I can. Just seeing this morning on my first day, the standards are what I expected from two top Premier League goalkeepers. “I’ve played at Selhurst Park in recent years and it’s a very daunting ground to play at. The fans are known for their home and away support but particularly at Selhurst so it would be amazing to witness it first hand.” Henderson travelled with Roy Hodgson’s squad to Switzerland today for the upcoming pre-season tour.

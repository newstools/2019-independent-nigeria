Valencia have beaten West Ham to the signing of Celta Vigo striker Maxi Gomez despite the club offering to meet his €50million (£45m) buyout clause, According to Standard.co.uk. The Hammers have tracked the Spanish striker since January, when the collapse of Marko Arnautovic’s move to China delayed any move until the summer. West Ham have been locked in talks with Celta Vigo this summer over a deal, having lodged an initial £25m offer which was promptly knocked back. Gomez has been caught between West Ham and Valencia, who won the Copa del Rey last season and will play in the Champions League in the coming campaign. The Spanish side have also matched the buyout clause, while including striker former Celta man Santi Mina as part of the deal. The striker started his career at the Galician club and was keen on a return to the team where he made 56 appearances and scored 13 goals before moving to Valencia in 2015. Mina was back at Valencia’s training ground, Paterna, for pre-season fitness tests on Monday as he waited for a call from Celta. “Everyone knows I’m close to a return to Celta, which is my home,” the 23-year-old said. Gomez’s decision will come as a big blow to Manuel Pellegrini, though the Chilean remains confident of adding another striker to his squad this summer. The former Manchester City boss has admitted he is an admirer of Bournemouth and England striker Callum Wilson. The Cherries want around £60m for their star man, though the deal which saw Arnautovic join Shanghai SIPG this week has released funds for a potential move.

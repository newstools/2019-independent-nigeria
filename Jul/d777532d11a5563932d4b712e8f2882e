Fidelity Bank Plc yesterday expressed continuous support to the growth of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). The bank said that its loan to deposit ratio (LDR) was above the 60 per cent stipulated by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). Mr Gbolahan Joshua, the bank’s Chief Operation and Information Officer said this at the company’s SMEs forum in Lagos ahead of its Funding Connect Initiative. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The CBN recently mandated banks to maintain 60 per cent LDR effective Sept. 30, 2019, saying that the measure would ramp up growth in the Nigerian economy through adequate funding and investment in the real sector. The apex bank in the circular to the banks, explained that SMEs, retail, mortgage and consumer lending would be assigned a weight of 150 per cent in computing the LDR in order to encourage them. It noted that failure to meet the above minimum LDR by the specified date would result in a levy of additional Cash Reserve Requirement equal to 50 per cent of the lending shortfall on the target LDR. Joshua said that the bank’s LDR was already above the apex bank’s 60 per cent limit. “The LDR limit is 60 per cent, we are already above the LDR limit, and we don’t need to do any new lending to meet the LDR limit. “If you look at Fidelity in the last five years, every single year even during recession we have always grown our loan book. “We never stop lending, so we are not affected by this minimum policy and that doesn’t mean that we are going to scale down, we will still continue to lend, as you can see we are having a programme, the SMEs Funding Connect. “This programme is not about growing our loan book, its actually about supporting the SMEs,’’ he said. Joshua said that the bank had maintained healthy non-performing loans (NPLS) books due to robust risk management framework. “Our NPLS are below six per cent, our cost of risk below one per cent last year, actually about 0.5 per cent.”

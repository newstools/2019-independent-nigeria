Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq of Kwara State on Tuesday directed top civil servants to meet him at the state’s school for special needs people for their budget review meeting. In what was a first in the state’s history, AbdulRazaq said he purposely scheduled the meeting at the school to let the top bureaucrats and government functionaries ap­preciate the need to allocate resources in a manner that directly benefitted the down­trodden in society. The governor had earlier visited the school a few weeks ago to listen to the teachers and inspect the facilities there, apologising to the children and promising to quickly attend to their needs. “Work has started in line with our Iseya mantra. I’m sor­ry to drag you here; it is sym­bolic. This is necessary for you to understand that there are other people who have needs that we should meet. I want (the budget) to be more inclu­sive going forward,” he told the civil servants at the mid year budget review session in Ap­ata Yakuba suburb of Ilorin, the state capital. The meeting was attend­ed by the Head of Service, Mrs Susan Modupe Oluwole; Chairman of the Kwara State Internal Revenue Service (KW-IRS); permanent secretaries; directors and heads of various government departments and parastatals. AbdulRazaq told the bu­reaucrats that bringing them to the school was to ensure that budgets were made to reflect the condition of the people, and not a show of executive powers.

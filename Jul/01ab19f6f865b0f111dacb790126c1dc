The Belgian goalkeeper was expected to be the undisputed starter this season but this injury could be problematic down the road. Navas was rumored to be on his way out of the club but he will stay, so Courtois will need to fight hard if he wants to start on a consistent basis. If Courtois works hard, he could be ready for the start of the season, but Realâ€™s medical staff will not rush him back.

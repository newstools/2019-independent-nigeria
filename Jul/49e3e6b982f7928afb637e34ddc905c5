The Sun claimed the Blades made a club-record £10 million bid to try and lure the Scotland international to Bramall Lane, but the Swans have now said these reports are wide of the mark, According to Footballleagueworld.co.uk. McBurnie was one of Swansea’s leading figures last season, with his 24 goals in 44 matches helping the South Wales club towards a respectable tenth-placed finish in the Championship. Following his exploits last season, the club reportedly remain confident in keeping hold of McBurnie this summer, as there have been no concrete offers tabled for the prolific frontman. It is understood any club interested in securing McBurnie’s services would need to pay “silly money” in order to lure him away from SA1, where he still has two years to run on his contract. This update will come as a relief to Swansea fans, as it would come as an enormous blow if McBurnie’s goals were to be drained from the side. McBurnie established his reputation last season as one of the most lethal finishers in the second tier, so I personally think any potential buyer will need to stump up an amount closer to £20million to land his services. Swansea cannot afford to lose another of their key assets this summer following Daniel James’ departure, and it is also important the nucleus of last season’s side is retained following Steve Cooper’s arrival as head coach. McBurnie can be a leading figure for Swansea next term, and Cooper should be looking to build the side around him. His superb eye for goal means he is capable of singlehandedly winning his side matches.

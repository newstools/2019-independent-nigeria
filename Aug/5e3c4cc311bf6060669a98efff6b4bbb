With the rumours going around that the likelihood of the north relinquishing power to the South, come 2023 is very slim, Sen Shehu Sani, formerly representing Kaduna Central Senatorial Zone in Kaduna State of the National Assembly, has said it would amount to ingratitude for the North to hold on to power beyond 2023. The Senator who stated this during a Sallah visit to the former Governor of the state and his party PRP stalwart, Alhaji Balarabe Musa, noted that it was only easy for President Muhammadu Buhari to win and become president due to the support he got from Nigerians from all geo-political zones of the country in 2015 and 2019.

Sen Sani advised the North to put its house in order and address the problem of majority versus minority tribes in the region in order to make sustainable progress.

BOLU-OLU ESHO AKURE – Standard-bearer of Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) in 2016 governorship election in Ondo State, Eyitayo Jegede, has declared his intention to contest for the governorship ticket of the party at the primary. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Declaring his ambition on Monday at the Akure- South Local Government Area party secretariat on Oyemekun Road, Akure, the state capital, Eyitayo told the mammoth crowd of party faithful that he is set to unseat the All Progressives Congress (APC) government in the state. The party secretariat was thronged by party faithful around 12 noon to listen to and share the party’s governorship candidate in the last gubernatorial election in the state. Receiving Eyitayo at the Secretariat, the party Chairman in Akure South Local Government, Abiodun Omonijo, commended Eyitayo for presenting himself for the election. He said though the party has not endorsed any aspirant, he assured that the PDP leadership would conduct a free, fair and acceptable primary when the time comes. Having declared his intent at the local government level, Eyitayo stated how prepared he is for the task ahead, saying all party members must work in unity to achieve the goal. Some of the chieftains of the party, who accompanied Eyitayo to the venue of the declaration, told Daily Independent that the people of the state are tired of the APC-led administration in the state. They assured that the PDP, under Eyitayo, would take the state to greater heights and attend to the welfare of the people of the state if given the opportunity to run the affairs of the state. They, however, appealed to party delegates to vote overwhelmingly for Eyitayo at the party’s primary for him to emerge as the party’s standard bearer at the 2020 governorship election in the state.

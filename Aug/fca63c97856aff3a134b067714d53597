ASABA – The Delta State Government has described the promissory notes from the Federal Government instead of cash for the repair of federal roads in the state, saying it was unacceptable. Governor Ifeanyi Okowa noted this, while also lamenting the acute collapse of Federal Government roads across the state and urged the Federal Road Maintenance Agency (FERMA) to deliver on the mandate establishing it.

He said: “the state (Delta) has intervened in reconstruction, rehabilitation and maintenance of so many federal roads but no refund has been made.” Governor Okowa was represented by his Commissioner for Works, James Aguoye, supported by his counterpart in Information Ministry, Charles Aniagwu, as well as the Chief Press Secretary, Olise Ifejika, during briefing on his work-plans for massive road construction after the raining season in Asaba. He said the state had only received assurance of payment for its intervention on the Asaba-Ughelli-Warri Road dualization. “Agbor axis of the Agbor-Eku Road is the worst hit. The road has completely expired. It needs total reconstruction. “The state has appeared before the House of Representatives and the Senate over this matter. Other states have been paid but the only thing we got was a promissory note. But we will continue with the construction work. We can’t cry more than the bereaved because we have our own challenges.” The commissioner said as soon as the rains subside, a state of emergency would be declared on all ongoing projects, even as new projects would be awarded within Asaba capital territory and Warri/Uvwie Development Agency, and completed for commissioning. Aguoye maintained that houses that are standing on natural waterways will be demolished in due course.

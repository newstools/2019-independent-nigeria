Powered by RubiQube Ad Network He said, “It is interesting how officials of the immediate past administration in Ogun State have come out in the past month to render account of prudence during their reign from 2011 to 2019. “The effort, as it is already well known, is to portray the new administration of Prince Dapo Abiodun in bad light and dim the goodwill already being enjoyed by the government based on its good governance anchored on transparency and accountability. “It is no longer news that Governor Abiodun, upon assumption of office on May 29, embarked on tour of structures completed and commissioned in the twilight of the administration. “It is also no longer news that what the governor saw in some places, especially the Ogun State’s Judiciary Complex in Abeokuta, was an eye-sore of a hurriedly completed structure whose engineers did not adhere to standards”. “He immediately commissioned a panel of experts to investigate cost of the complex and why the standard fell short of expectation. The report is being awaited. “Prince Abiodun also inspected the Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital and discovered that the facility in there was not only below the required standard, but the hospital also needed immediate surgery because of years of neglect “Again, he commissioned a panel to look into the situation with a view to determining the needs and how to return the hospital to its glorious past.”

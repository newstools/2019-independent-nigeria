A South Carolina dad walked into a local police station this week and fessed up to brutally killing his own daughter, authorities said. Joshua Lee Burgess, 32, strangled Zaria Burgess, 15, and then slit her throat, officials said in court Monday, according to local station WSOC-TV. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Authorities got word of the horrific crime when Joshua walked into the Union County Sheriff’s Office lobby just before 9:30 a.m. Sunday and informed a dispatcher he was there to turn himself in, authorities said in a statement posted to Facebook. Once the dispatcher started asking Burgess’ name and searching for possible arrest warrants, he said he wouldn’t be in the system — and allegedly admitted he had just killed someone. He then gave further details, including the crime scene address and his daughter’s name, authorities said. Responding deputies found Zaria dead inside the home, and secured the scene until investigators arrived. “She was the type of kid to come in a room [or] come or in a house and say, ‘Hey everybody’ — just wanting to make everybody smile,” her cousin, Dytaysha Wadsworth, told the TV station. “She was so young and nobody deserves to leave this world like that, especially by someone they thought was gonna protect them and be there for them.” The dad is being held without bond in the Union County Jail on a first-degree murder charge, according to the report. He will appear in court again next month. His motive in the slaying was unclear.

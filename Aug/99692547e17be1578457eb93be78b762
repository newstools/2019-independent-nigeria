The Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (SSANU) and Non Academic Staff Union (NASU) on Friday urged the Federal Government to honour their 2009 agreement to avoid total strike. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The Ahmadu Bello University (ABU) branch of the two unions made their stand known while addressing a joint press briefing at SSANU secretariat, main campus, Samaru, Zaria, Kaduna State. SSANU branch Chairman, Mr Iliyasu Abdur-Ra’uf-Bello said the five days warning strike presently embarked upon by the two unions was as a result of the inability of the federal government to implement the 2009 union/Federal Government agreement. “I have the pleasure to address the press on why SSANU and NASU are on five days warning strike, this is as a result of government inability to meet, implement or enforce the 2009 union/Federal Government agreement. “This agreement was signed in 2009. Ten years into this agreement, we are still dilly-dallying, we are neither here nor there in the implementation of the content of this agreement.

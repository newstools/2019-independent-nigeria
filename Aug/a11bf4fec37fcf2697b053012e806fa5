Alex Iwobi is one of those players that splits opinion among Arsenal fans, anyone reading the comments on this website would know that and that was before Dani Ceballos and Nicolas Pepe signed. Now that Ceballos and Pepe are in the squad Iwobiâ€™s detractors are even more convinced that he is surplus to requirements while his defenders are scrambling around to justify his remaining at the Emirates. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network I am on the side of those that believe he still has a role to play and could even benefit from having the likes of Pepe around him. It is going to be a long season, Arsenal are in four competitions and the squad is going to be stretched, tiredness definitely took hold last season for the teams battling it out for the final two top-four positions and it will be the squads with the best talent in depth that will hold the advantage. If you lack quality back up you pay a price and Iwobi would, in my opinion, qualify as quality back up. I know he can be frustrating but you have to remember the number of games he played for Arsenal last season, especially in the long unbeaten run. He was clearly useful in that period and does have the trust of Unai Emery. I think the days of Iwobi being a starter will be very limited but as an impact sub and in the lesser competitions he will be very useful. So, yes, I do believe that Iwobi has an important role to play but only as a squad player and not as a first-team starter.

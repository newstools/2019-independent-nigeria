It was a tale of two stories for Brighton and West Ham as they kicked off their 2019-20 Premier League campaigns last weekend. The new season brought along plenty of optimism for both sides after strong summer transfer windows but while there was delight for one during the first game of the season, it was agony for the other. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network After surviving relegation by the skin of their teeth last season, Brighton got off to the perfect start this time round with an emphatic 3-0 win at Watford thanks to Abdoulaye Doucoure ‘ s o w n – goal and s t r i k e s from Florin Andone and debutant Neal Maupay. But for the Hammers, it was a different story altogether as they were humiliated 5-0 by reigning champions Manchester City at the London Stadium. Raheem Sterling scored a hat-trick, while Gabriel Jesus and Sergio Aguero grabbed a goal each. As the transfer window slammed shut on August 8 on the eve of the new Premier League season, the Seagulls would have been quietly very satisfied with their business after what was an extremely tough campaign last time out. After finishing just two points above the relegation zone last season before sacking Chris Hughton, it was imperative Brighton got rid of that wave of negativity surrounding the club. And they did exactly that over the past couple of months, strengthening the spine of the team that had gone stale under Chris Hughton. T h e y captured the signings of N e a l Maupay, A a r o n Mooy and Adam Webster from Brentford, Huddersfield and Bristol City respectively, as well as keeping hold of star players, including Lewis Dunk, who attracted interest from Leicester. And after overseeing his first pre-season with Brighton, Potter couldn’t have asked for a better start to life on the south coast with a statement win over Watford.

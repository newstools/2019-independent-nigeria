LAGOS – The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has been charged to ensure that the national team starts early preparations ahead of the qualifiers for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon. Nigeria is pooled in Group L of the qualifiers against Benin Republic, Sierra Leone and Lesotho and the two top sides would qualify for the Cup of Nations scheduled for Cameroon. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Speaking exclusively to DAILY INDEPENDENT on Sunday, former captain of the Super Eagles, Joseph Yobo, noted that nothing should be taking for granted, even as he acknowledged that on paper, Nigeria stand tall ahead of the rest. “We should learn from recent results, particularly in the manner Madagascar defeated us at the Nations Cup in Egypt. So that should serve as a wakeup call for the Super Eagles to start early preparations for the qualifiers. “I know that it (qualifiers) starts this year but nothing should be taking for granted, otherwise those teams you call little may shock us; it has happened before and it can equally happen again if we underrate them,” he said. Yobo, the captain of the Super Eagles that won Nigeria’s third AFCON title, noted that the team tried their best in Egypt, hoping that they would take it further when the competition comes to Cameroon in 2021.

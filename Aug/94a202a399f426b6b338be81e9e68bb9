LAGOS – Everton of England midfielder, Alex Iwobi has received plaudits from The Toffees’ coach, Marco Silva, following the Super Eagles’ star’s first goal for the club, since arriving from Arsenal on transfer deadline day. Iwobi got off the mark in his first start for The Toffees, as he struck in their 4-2 win away to Lincoln City in the Carabao Cup, and Silva was left reeling lyrical about the summer signing, whose quality the gaffer said will continue getting better with each passing match. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network “Alex gave us very good things during that moment. I’m 100% sure with more minutes in his legs, having more training sessions, getting to know his teammates better and creating normal connections we will see his quality. “We know he is a good player and we also know his ability but we are also sure that he can only get better with time and with every match”, Silva told Liverpool Echo. The Portuguese gaffer praised Iwobi for his display against Lincoln City, but also recalled that the lad had earlier done well also on his debut against Aston Villa last Friday in the English Premier League (EPL), which makes him certain the new arrival will bring more quality to The Toffees. Iwobi has revealed that his decision to leave Arsenal for Everton was to take on greater responsibility as a player.

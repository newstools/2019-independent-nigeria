Samuel Umtiti has also reportedly been told by Barcelona they will not delay any move if a suitable offer comes in as they are willing to allow a quickfire sale. Spanish publication AS claim the defender has been in discussions with Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network However, no formal offer has yet been made to Barcelona. If either side makes a reasonable bid then the La Liga club have apparently given the centre-back their word that he can leave the Nou Camp. Umtiti has struggled with injury problems over the last year and has since fallen behind Clement Lenglet in the pecking order. United are thought to be looking for more defensive cover after Eric Bailly suffered a knee injury which will keep him sidelined for up to five months. Speaking of the injury, manager Old Gunner Solskjaer said: “Eric has had an operation and will be out for four to five months. Hopefully we’ll have him back around Christmas time.” The Red Devils are on the verge of breaking the world record transfer fee for a defender if Harry Maguire passes his medical. They are set to spend £85 million on the Leicester and England star. United chiefs are also in discussions with Juventus for strikers Mario Mandzukic and Paulo Dybala. The deal could see Romelu Lukaku head in the opposite direction if it is wrapped up before Thursday’s 5pm deadline.

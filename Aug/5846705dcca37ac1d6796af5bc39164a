One of the leading private schools in Lagos State, Al Maruf Schools, is 20 years old. The school which was established in 1999 has grown in leaps and bounds. According to the Proprietor, Alhaji Maruf Openiyi Olalekan, the journey had been filled with laughter, struggles, mistakes, sorrow and challenges. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network He said he felt it was important to celebrate the milestones because of the journey he embarked on to give the opportunity to set new goals for the future. “Down the memory lane, it was actually a strange idea then to think of having a school that will combine Western, Islamic and moral education into one single curriculum. At a point in time, some were calling us ‘Ile Kewu’ and jeering at us, believing that we would soon be tired and the whole thing was bound to crumble. “When the challenges came, we almost backslide but Allah His mercy kept us strong and held our feet firmly. “From a rented apartment at 4, Bilewu Street, Alasia Bus- stop, we were able to get our own permanent site within the first three years of existence. Today, we are not only blessed with permanent site for the primary section, Allah has also blessed us with a permanent structure for the secondary”, the Proprietor said.

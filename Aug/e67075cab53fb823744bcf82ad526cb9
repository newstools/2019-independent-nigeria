LAGOS – The Chartered Institute of Transport Administration (CIoTA), has attributed most of the challenges faced by the users of Lagos ports’ roads to overstretching of the Apapa and Tin Can Island Ports from the capacity they were designed to handle. Bashir Jamoh, President of the institute, who also doubles as the Executive Director, Finance and Administration, Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), in a chat with DAILY INDEPENDENT, said both ports have exceeded 80 per cent of their capacity.

He said: “The capacity of the Apapa and Tin Can Island port when you look at it at the inception it was lower but today, they have exceeded more than 80 per cent of the capacity they have and the population is growing. “In the ’70s, we can imagine what Apapa and Tin Can port were, and look at the population then and now and we look at the infrastructure at the 70s vis a vis our own size of economy and what we have today.” Jamoh also advised that since the two major seaports had been overstretched, there was urgent need to enlarge them in order to compete with neighbouring countries in the region. The CIoTA boss, who called for more deep sea ports in the country to encourage global competitiveness, assured that all Nigerian seaports would be connected by rail. “President Muhammadu Buhari has said recently that all ports in the country are connected to the hinterland and the government is thinking of that and I mentioned it earlier that the institute will concentrate on the development of intermodal system for evacuation of cargoes from the seaports where we can be using the sea, rail, air and road and we ensure we make use of pipeline which we are not making good use of in this part of the country “When we look at our coastal line from Apapa to Badagry, it is very good in developing the port and now the deep seaport is coming, though Badagry port has some challenges with NPA but we hope to see the Lekki deep seaport,” he added.

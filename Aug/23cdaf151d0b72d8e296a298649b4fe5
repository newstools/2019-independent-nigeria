YOLA – Despite threats posed by bandits and Boko Haram, the Adamawa/Taraba customs command has disclosed its overshooting its target by over N19 million from January to July 2019 and generated N105,945,138.44 during the period under review. Making the disclosure at a press conference in Yola, the command’s area comptroller, Kamardeen Olumoh, said the feat was achieved as a result of wider stakeholder sensitization, the introduction of Nigeria Integrated Customs Information System (NICIS) as well as curbing smuggling activities in the command. According to him: “The command has witnessed significant progress in revenue generation thereby impacting positively on the morale of officers and men. “The command has so far between January to July generated the sum of N105, 945,138.44. These figures represent 44.66% increase over the corresponding period of the previous year by N73.23m. “When assessed in relation to the revenue target of N86.72m given to the command for same period, it still marked an increase of 22.17% so far. “So far, the command has at the end of July 2019 achieved 71.26% of its annual target. This increase in the revenue generation is not unconnected with our effort in stakeholders’ sensitization that has encouraged traders to come forward to make proper declaration of their imported items mostly agricultural produce. “The introduction of (NICIS) Nigeria Integrated Customs Information System in April/May this year is playing a major role in encouraging importers to make declarations because of its flexibility which is in tune with the Federal Government policy on the ease of doing business,” he said. Olumoh also disclosed that the command has stepped up its anti-smuggling war, which led to several seizures, including 2,527, 50kg of foreign parboiled rice, 12 motor vehicles, 22 motorcycles 240 bales of second hand clothing. Other seizures made according to Olumoh included cartons of spaghetti, elephant tusks, buffalo horns, used tyres and tricycles, adding that the command recently seized 52 drums of petroleum products with each drum containing 230 liters, noting that the duty paid value of all the seized items stood at N80,598,476.23.

UGHELLI – Leaders and members of the Delta State Ex-Councillors Forum have refuted a story published in a national daily, credited to some members of the group that the Hon. Felix Ayemidejor-led executive has been replaced by a new one led by one Mr. Kema Egenu. Hon. Sunday Iyeke, the group’s Public Relations Officer (PRO), in a statement issued after its executive meeting in Sapele, Sapele Local Government Area of Delta State at the weekend,
said the Hon Felix Ayemidejorled executive remained the authentic executive of the forum. He described those behind the said publication as impostors, whose greed and desperation overshadowed their logical reasoning and judgment.

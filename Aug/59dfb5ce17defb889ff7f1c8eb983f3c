YENAGOA – Residents in Bayelsa State, on Tuesday, expressed mixed reactions over the lifting of sanction on the Port Harcourt Electricity Distribution Company (PHED) by the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) over popper supply. While some argued that the suspension of the sanction would translate to improved power supply in Yenagoa and its environs, others submitted that it would not. TCN on Tuesday announced the lifting of a suspension order from the electricity market it imposed on the PHED since July 27, for breach of ‘Market Conditions/participation Agreement’. According to the TCN notice available on its portal, the lifting of the sanction which
followed PHED’s compliance took effect on Monday. The PHED and TCN had been trading blames on the poor power supply in Bayelsa State with TCN saying that the PHED was unable to take up available power at its substation in Yenagoa while the PHED alleged that it was not getting enough power from the TCN grid. The face-off subsequently led to the sanctioning of the PHED by the TCN. But some residents in Yenagoa, the Bayelsa State capital, said that the consumers were the ones bearing the brunt of the disagreement between TCN and PHED, adding that small businesses were the worst hit. Ebikeme Joseph, a barber while reacting to the development said that the resolution was a welcome development as he expects improved power supply.

LAGOS – Two-time Olympic champion, Caster Semenya, has expressed disappointment over her inability to defend the 800m title at the World Championships in Doha this September due to the Federal Supreme Court in Switzerland ruling which bars her from competing at the championships. Semenya, who had sued the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) over its controversial female eligibility regulations, has, however, vowed to continue the fight against the rules that affect athletes with differences of sexual development (DSD). Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The Swiss Court had In June, provisionally suspended the regulations, which require women with high testosterone levels to take medication in order to compete at distances between 400m and the mile or change to another distance. But the court, had on Tuesday, reversed its decision. Since the rules have been reinstated for the time being, Semenya would have to submit to hormone-reducing medication in order to continue to compete at the Worlds. According to the IAAF, all DSD athletes are obliged to reduce their testosterone to a specific level for at least six months, and then maintain that for the rest of their athletic career. But Semenya has remained resolute in her decision not to take drugs. “I am very disappointed to be kept from defending my hard-earned title,” Semenya said, on Tuesday. “But this will not deter me from continuing my fight for the human rights of all of the female athletes concerned.” Semenya lodged an appeal to Switzerland’s highest court in May after failing to have the IAAF’s testosterone rules overturned by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). She won a temporary suspension of the rules in the Swiss court, which allowed her to race while awaiting the final outcome of her appeal.

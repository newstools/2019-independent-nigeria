Further output cuts by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), could be in the offing in the face of weekly slides in oil prices as a result of US-China trade tensions, analysts said. Oil prices saw another overall fall in prices last week, with Brent closing at $58.53 and West Texas Intermediate on $54.50, down 5.4 per cent and 2 per cent respectively. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The downward trend in prices saw reports emerging saying that Saudi Arabia was contacting other OPEC producers to discuss how to stop the slide in prices, with Friday’s oil prices going up slightly on speculation of a possible new round in output cuts. “The oil market is hugely volatile and dynamic at the moment with the main factor in the driving seat being the concern about a trade war with the US and China,” said Edward Bell, commodity analyst, Global Markets and Treasury, Emirates NBD. “We have a few weeks to go before this new higher tariff rate comes in covering pretty much all goods between China and the US, which could lead to slower economic growth and Chinese retaliation,” he added. Bell said OPEC’s response could come in the form of either further output cuts or putting pressure on producers to abide by their output cut agreements. “There has been news of Saudi Arabia trying to bring other producers to try and take action. The measures that are available to them is to decrease production or to encourage others to hit their targets that were agreed to in previous output cuts. Beyond that there is very little much else that can be done.”

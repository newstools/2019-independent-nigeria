AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, Kwara State governor, on Monday rallied the people behind his agenda for reforms and paradigm shift in governance, calling the 2019 election a referendum that saw people choosing development and prudence over waste and underdevelopment. Speaking at the Second Annual Grand Durbar ceremony organised by the Ilorin Emirate Council, AbdulRazaq said the people’s resolve for a new dawn meant a need to eschew actions or inactions that made development and growth difficult in the past.

We must make tough choices in our decision to move our state forward,” the governor, who was represented by his Deputy, Mr. Kayode Alabi, stated. “I have made my personal decision along this line. I will not use public funds to enjoy or gratify myself at the expense of the people. Public resources will only be applied strictly to public projects and overheads approved and budgeted for. We will not entertain excesses of any sort. With people’s interest as the guiding principle, we will do things differently and purposefully to get more impactful results. “I appeal to this distinguished gathering of our people to unite behind this agenda for the progress of our community and generations yet unborn. Anything short of this will keep us moving in a circle and that would defeat the purpose of our people standing in the sun to vote the way they did,” he said.

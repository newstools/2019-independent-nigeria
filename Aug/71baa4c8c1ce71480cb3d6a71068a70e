LAGOS – Peering Advocacy and Advancement Centre In Africa (PAACA) has restated its call for increased anti-corruption campaign in the country. This is just as the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has encouraged Nigerians to continue to volunteer information on cases of corruption in the country. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The PAACA lamented the depth of corruption across the different spheres of the Nigerian society at a town hall meeting on Tuesday in Ikeja, Lagos. Speaking during the event themed “Strengthening the Moral Institution in Building a Corrupt Free Society” with different religious leaders in attendance, Ezenwa Nwagwu, PAACA’s Executive Director, emphasised the need for a uniform anti-corruption message for advocacy in the religious and traditional circles, which he pointed as the core of the meeting. Nwagwu said, “Being that the anti-corruption fight aims to form the high moral and ethical standard amongst individuals both in public and private sectors, social accountability and responsibility, a practice that strongly resonates with religious teachings, co-opting the religious bodies into the campaign would provide a spiritual dimension to the message of the campaign thus encouraging a wider acceptance by the people.” Mr. Ayo Oyewole, Public Relations Officer of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), encouraged the public to bring to their notice genuine information of cases of corruption.

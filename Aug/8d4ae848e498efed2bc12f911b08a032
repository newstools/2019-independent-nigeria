Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The governor announced these on Tuesday when the Comptroller General of the Federal Fire Service, Dr. Liman Ibrahim, paid a courtesy visit on him as part of the ongoing 10th national council on fire hosted by the Kwara State government. AbdulRazaq said the government would also embark on capacity building for officers of the state fire service as a corollary to the ongoing renovation of the Fire Service Station on Unity Road in Ilorin being done by his administration. Ibrahim thanked the governor for hosting the national council on fire, as well as the ongoing renovation of the fire station. He had earlier urged the governor to establish new fire stations in other senatorial districts of the state to curtail any fire outbreak in the state.

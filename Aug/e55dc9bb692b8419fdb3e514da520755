OSOGBO – Most Rev. John Akin Oyejola, the Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Osogbo, Osun State, has called for stronger solidarity and passionate collaboration of all people of goodwill in the society to pursue end to the hopeless situation in the country. This, he said, would facilitate the emergence of a crisis-free-society built on the advancement of the dignity of every human being. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Bishop Oyejola stated this during the commissioning of the new office complex (Prince of Peace House) of the Justice, Development and Peace Makers’ Centre (JDPMC) of Osogbo, a faith-based, non-governmental, non-political, not-for profit and charity organization. The event was held at Bishop’s House Oke-Ayepe in Osun State. He expressed deep concern over the poverty index and human rights abuses in the state, which, according to him, calls for special reflection and spontaneous reactions from all stakeholders both political and non-political actors, especially those who are blessed and have financial capacity to raise the standard of living of the downtrodden. “Governments at all levels are striving so hard to combat poverty in the country, also in Osun State in particular, but it is still worrisome that the efforts are not breaking the walls of poor living in any form as the daily verifiable indices yet still point to the reality of acute poverty in Nigeria today. “This is why Justice Development and Peace Makers’ Centre of Osogbo Diocese has decided to take it upon itself to put a structure like this that solely aimed at opening its heart and door to whoever intends to partner with it so as to put an end to poverty. “For this reason, this new office also known as Prince of Peace House is being commissioned and dedicated to indigents and poor in Nigeria for their better tomorrow,“ he concluded.

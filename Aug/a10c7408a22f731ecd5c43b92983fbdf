Nicki Minaj is set to wed in the next 80 days. Back in June, the star confirmed she and her fiance Kenneth Petty had obtained a marriage licence. And speaking on her Queen Radio show on Apple Beats 1 on Monday, she revealed she only just got round to collecting the document, which puts a time frame on when the couple can tie the knot. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The 36-year-old shared she and Petty “filed for the marriage licence and we still had to pick it up and I was travelling, by the time I came back, we had to renew it again. “From that time, you have 90 days to get married. That was about a week ago, so now I have about 80 days,” the Anaconda star explained. However, while the rapper is working on new material, she revealed she’s pushing “the big wedding” until “later” in favour of a smaller ceremony, adding: “I’ll be married before my album comes out, but will have my wedding after the album comes out. “Before the 90 days is over, yes, I will be married. I’m very happy about that because my baby makes me so happy.” The Megatron hitmaker and Petty have been dating since last December.

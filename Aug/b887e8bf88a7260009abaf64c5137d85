LAGOS – With barely 24 hours to the Eid-el-Kabir ‘Ileya’ festival, several Muslim families are yet to purchase enough customary rams for the celebration of the festival. This is mostly due to the current, unfriendly state of the economy and the high cost of purchasing the rams. Traders across major Nigerian markets in places like Lagos, Ogun and Osun States have also seized the opportunity, with the approaching holidays, to significantly increase prices of ram and to make extra gains off food items. Saturday INDEPENDENT gathered that some traders doubled the prices of the rams to squeeze more money out of customers. At one of the biggest ram markets at Mangoro, Agege in Lagos, a ram currently goes for an average price of N80,000, which is almost twice the price of a regular ram on a normal day.

A Muslim cleric also confirmed that the traders are merely capitalising on the situation to get more money from people who would be needing ram for the Eid ceremony. It was the same story at Ede market in Osun State where a ram was billed as high as N70,000, more than double of what it was sold mere weeks ago. As a supplement, many families that buy as much as five or six rams decided to buy only one or two and augment with a cow. Alhaji Nurudeen Adesina, who resides in Ojodu area of Lagos explained that usually, his family buys five rams, and he always gets at least one more as a gift. “This year, things are tighter, so I only bought two, and then we bought a cow to supplement it. This is to augment the ram because we would need to serve guests

MAKURDI – The Benue State Government says it would evacuate about 812 students from the Federal University, Wukari, Taraba State, following disturbances that erupted in the institution on Tuesday.
Unconfirmed reports have it that two students and a staff of the university may have lost their lives as a reprisal from the Tiv/Jukun clash in Taraba.
Professor Dennis Ityavyar, the Benue State Commissioner for Education, who spoke with newsmen in Makurdi on Wednesday, said the state government was yet to confirm the number of casualties so far recorded in the crisis.
According to him, they have been informed that the two persons were missing and until it was confirmed otherwise, it was not time to declare the persons dead.
He further explained that the state government has provided vehicles and security agencies have been detailed to escort the students out of the school premises and back to Benue State.
He noted that the state government has dispatched about 15 buses among them four marcopolo buses to evacuate the students, who he said were already gathered together in one place preparatory to their home coming.
While he decried the situation that has led to the disruption of the school calendar, he lamented that the trauma experienced by some of the students might have brought to a halt their educational career.

The Trump administration on Friday slapped sanctions on two Taiwan-based individuals and several shipping companies for providing oil shipments to North Korea in violation of U.N. sanctions. The Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control also identified one vessel as “blocked property” after engaging in ship-to-ship transfers of oil to North Korean vessels. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network “Treasury will implement and enforce existing U.S. and U.N. sanctions on individuals, entities, and vessels involved in illicit ship-to-ship transfers with North Korean flagged vessels,” said Treasury Undersecretary Sigal Mandelker. “Shipping companies trading with North Korea are exposing themselves to significant sanctions risk, despite the deceptive practices they try to employ.” The administration’s action freezes any U.S. assets of the individuals and companies and could expose other companies doing business with them to further sanctions. OFAC designated Taiwan-based individuals Huang Wang Ken and Chen Mei Hsiang and the Taiwan-based firms Jui Pang Shipping Co. Ltd. and Jui Zong Ship Management Co. Ltd., as well as Hong Kong-based Jui Cheng Shipping Company Limited, for having engaged in at least one significant shipment to North Korea.

Everton boss Marco Silva could have Lucas Digne available for his side’s trip to Aston Villa under the lights on Friday night. The Toffees travel to AVFC looking to extend their positive start to the season. The former Barcelona man was withdrawn in the second half of the Toffees’ 1-0 win over Watford at Goodison Park with a hamstring injury. His inclusion for the trip to Villa Park was in major jeopardy that twinned with Leighton Baines still recovering from a knock left Silva with a potential headache at left-back. However, the 26-year-old has been pictured taking a regular part in Everton’s training session ahead of the trip to Villa, hinting at his potential involvement later this week. Digne is a crucial part of Silva’s side and after winning the Player’s Player of the Season Award last campaign, has already started with an assist as the Toffees have gone unbeaten through their first two games. He is part of a miserly defence that has now registered five straight clean sheets at home, whilst keeping 10 in their last 13 Premier League matches in all. Elsewhere at Everton’s Finch Farm training ground, Baines continues to train with the first team alongside former Villa man Fabian Delph who could make his debut at his old stomping ground

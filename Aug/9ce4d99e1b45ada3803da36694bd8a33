Tottenham Hotspur fell to a disappointing defeat at the hands of Newcastle United on Sunday afternoon, and Mauricio Pochettino made his feelings clear at full-time. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Despite dominating possession, Spurs couldn’t break down their stubborn opponents and we’re beaten 1-0 after Joelinton’s 27th minute goal. In the aftermath of the defeat, Tottenham boss Pochettino gave a damning report of his player’s performance and bemoaned their lack of creativity when in possession. “We didn’t play well and I’m very disappointed about our performance. We conceded a very cheap goal and then it was difficult,” Pochettino said, as reported by The Guardian. “We created some chances but not enough. We should have played better, [with] more desire, more capacity, more aggression with the ball. “To have 80% of possession is too much when you only have a few shots on target.” Spurs were controversially denied a penalty late on, with their claims turned down by the referee and also VAR, as they felt they were robbed of a chance to steal a point. Pochettino refused to be drawn into those claims though, and instead blamed his player’s lack of desire as Newcastle showed more mettle than Tottenham to fight for the three points. It was a strong Spurs line-up, however influential midfielder Christian Eriksen was only used from the bench as his future at the club is still unsure. With the European window still open clubs are circling the Tottenham man, who has made his desire to leave very clear, however Pochettino wasn’t using that as an excuse for their poor performance. ”The situation is so difficult but we cannot blame this [for the performance],” Pochettino continued. “It is not a justification for the performance. When you play football and you are on the pitch, you don’t think about this situation.”

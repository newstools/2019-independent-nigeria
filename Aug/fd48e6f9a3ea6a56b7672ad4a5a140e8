ADO-EKITI – Teachers in public schools in Ekiti State would soon be swapped for efficiency. Professor Fransisca Aladejana, chairman of Ekiti State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB), made this known while receiving members of the state House of Assembly Committee on Education, Science and Technology on a familiarisation visit to her office in Ado Ekiti.

Aladejana solicited the support of the state House of Assembly for the board to achieve its mandate of revitalising and repositioning the basic education sector in the state, stressing that all hands must be on deck towards ensuring the success of the ongoing reforms in the education sector. Lamenting the abject neglect suffered by the basic education sector under the immediate past administration, Aladejana recalled that on assumption of office in October, 2018, the present administration inherited schools with dilapidated buildings, adding that the morale of teachers was very low due to nonpayment of salaries and lack of training while school enrollment was at its lowest ebb due to the inhernt problems in the system. She, however, expressed pleasure at the progress recorded so far, stressing that Governor Kayode Fayemi had cleared the arrears of counterpart funds to UBEC, thus opening ways for the ongoing massive renovation of schools, provision of infrastructure including toilet facilities to schools as well as construction of perimeter fences to bolster security in public schools in the state. Aladejana noted that the present administration has also been giving premium to teachers’ welfare and capacity building as well as provision of instructional materials and running grants to schools in the state.

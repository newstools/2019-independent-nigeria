Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The full-back was withdrawn during the first half of Saturday’s 2-1 defeat at home to Crystal Palace with a hamstring problem.

Speaking in the immediate aftermath of the match, United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said he was hopeful Shaw would return for this weekend’s trip to Southampton. But scans have shown the injury is more serious than first thought and the England international could be out for around four weeks. Ashley Young, who replaced Shaw against Palace, will now get another run in the side with Diogo Dalot – another option in that position – also absent due to injury. Shaw has battled numerous fitness problems during his five years at Old Trafford. Last season was the first in which he had made over 20 league appearances for the club in a single campaign, and he impressed sufficiently enough to be named United’s Player of the Year for 2018-19.

Southampton will be without injured wingers Nathan Redmond and Moussa Djenepo for today’s (Saturday’s) EPL clash with Manchester United. Redmond could be sidelined for up to three weeks after suffering an ankle injury in the midweek Carabao Cup win at Fulham, while summer signing Djenepo sustained a muscle problem in the match. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Striker Michael Obafemi, who scored the winner at Craven Cottage, is doubtful because of cramp. Left-back Ryan Bertrand (ankle) has returned to training and will be assessed. Manchester United duo Anthony Martial and Luke Shaw have been ruled out of the trip to the south coast.

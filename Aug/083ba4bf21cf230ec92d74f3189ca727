LAGOS – The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Thursday said 80 percent of its budget for the 2019 elections was used to offset the bills of one million ad-hoc staff who manned different polling units during the conduct of the 2019 general elections. President Muhammadu Buhari in July 2018 requested the sum of N242.45 billion in a letter to the National Assembly for the conduct of the elections. The amount, which was the highest in the history of elections in Nigeria was to be shared between the INEC and five other security agencies that participated in the elections.

Speaking in an exclusive chat with Daily Independent, Festus Okoye, INEC Commissioner for Information and Voter Education, said the commission will soon render an account of how the money was disbursed to Nigerians. He however said despite the high figures, the money pales into insignificance when compared to what was incurred by the commission in the conduct of the elections. According to him, aside payment of ad-hoc staff, the commission also spent the money on procurement of sensitive and non-sensitive materials, logistics as well as payment of other incidentals which occur during the conduct of the elections. “Of course, the commission is accountable to the Nigerian people. What you should know is that 80 percent of that entire money goes into the payment of ad-hoc staff of the commission”. “For that election, INEC recruited over a million ad-hoc staff and when you recruit over a million ad-hoc staff, you pay their honorarium, transportation and you also pay all sorts of incidentals. “You will see that the money pales into insignificance and then it is worthy to note that INEC does procurement. We procured ballot papers, sensitive materials and some of these sensitive materials are not even procured in Nigeria.”

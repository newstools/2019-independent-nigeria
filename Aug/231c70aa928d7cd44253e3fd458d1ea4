UGHELLI – The Academic Staff Union of Secondary Schools (ASUSS), Delta State chapter, is currently at loggerhead with the state’s chapter of the Nigerian Union of Teachers (NUT) over the latter’s proposed N5000 monthly deductions from government tutors across the state. ASUSS, at a sensitization meeting of its members in Zone 6, comprising Ughelli North and South, Udu, Patani, Bomadi and Burutu local government areas, held weekend at Ughelli, vowed to employ all legitimate means to stop the NUT from going ahead with the deductions. It would be recalled that the state chapter of NUT had through a recent publication proposed an increase in the subscription/contribution under the Delta State Social Savings Investment Scheme (DSTSSIS) from N2,000 to N5,000 monthly per teacher. Speaking during the meeting, the state chairman of ASUSS, Comrade Okoh Kenneth, said that the move by NUT was informed by greed, adding that the pro
posal was dead on arrival. Kenneth said, “We are here today to address our rights that are about to be ripped by the NUT. On the 16th of July 2019, the NUT said they held a conclusive congress of the DSTSSIS where they claimed tutors had agreed to increase their monthly deductions from N,2000 to N5,000. “I want to first of all let you know that the same scheme that wants to increase the deductions has no penny in it, they are bankrupt. Those who have retired years ago are yet to
be paid because they said no money and yet they are planning to increase the deductions. “All tutors in the state are adults and you don’t force an adult to save. Saving is something voluntary. The weight of each one’s responsibility differs. It’s the tutors that should be the ones to say whether they want to increase their savings or not. There are teachers whose monthly take home is less than N5000 and you want to increase it to N5000, where will such get the money to pay.”

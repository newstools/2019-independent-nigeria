P/HARCOURT – The pan-Ogoni group, Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) has rejected the plans by the federal government to establish military barracks and central cemetery in Ogoni, saying that it was shocked by such decisions. MOSOP said it considers these projects as death sentences, a direct reflection of the hate for the Ogoni people in Nigeria and government nonchalance to the priorities of the people, especially as the prison project had been cited on a land initially meant for the construction of the Integrated Soil Management Center which should support the Ogoni cleanup exercise. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Fegalo Nsuke, the factional president of MOSOP in a statement on Sunday “called for the cancellation of these projects and a halt to further assault on the Ogoni people”. Fegalo added, “Our priorities at the moment is for Nigeria to respect the rights of the Ogoni people and end the discrimination against us, implement the UNEP report on Ogoni diligently commencing with the provision of potable drinking water and create jobs through deliberate investment in agriculture. “We are worried that despite our overwhelming rejection of the prison, cemetery and militarization projects, the government will still contemplate these torture and repressive centres for Ogoni which has now commenced with the construction of a prison”.

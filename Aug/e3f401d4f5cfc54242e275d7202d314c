DAMATURU – Ahmad Lawan, the Senate President, on Monday, received a rousing welcome from an excited crowd in his constituency in Yobe North, in Yobe State. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Lawan, who departed Abuja on Monday, was on a ‘Thank you’ visit to his constituents, the first time since his emergence as president of the ninth Senate in June. Yobe North Senatorial District comprises of six local government areas of Nguru, Machina, Karasuwa, Yusufari, Jakusko and Bade. Lawan was greeted by a large turnout and accorded a heroic welcome as his convoy pulled up at the headquarters of three of the six Local Government Areas that make up the Yobe North Senatorial District. The security men had a hectic day controlling the crowd which intermittently halted the convoy and compelled Lawan out of his vehicle, all in a desperate bid to catch a glimpse of their illustrious son, who had brought honour and fame to their community. Lawan’s first port of call was the palace of the Emir of Nguru, where he was conferred with a chieftaincy title of Mukaddam of Nguru by the Emir, Alhaji Mustapha Ibn Mai Kyari. After a sympathy visit to the recently burnt market and flooded community in Nguru, Lawan addressed his party leaders. He, thereafter, proceeded to Machina and later headed to Jajimaji before he eventually arrived in his native home of Gashua late on Monday. Lawan on Tuesday continued his ‘Thank you’ visit to the other three Local Government Areas of Yusufari, Jakusko and Bade. “I thank God Almighty for giving me the opportunity to visit my senatorial district after a while since I was elected President of the Senate in June,” Lawan told journalists at his residence in Gashua. “This will be the first time I’ll be back home because of the demands of the office. I am so happy and pleased. “Above all, I’m very grateful to the people of my senatorial district for the very warm and rousing reception that I received in all the three local governments visited so far.

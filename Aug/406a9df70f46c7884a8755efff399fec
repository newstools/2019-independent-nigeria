Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Speaking on the topic: ‘Can I trust you? Elegbe explained the relationship between equality and equity, noting that “we do not all have equal strengths, opportunities and privileges. “However, with a sense of equity, the more privileged would share with the less privileged. “While it is wrong for the less privileged to demand equity as a right – as that is extortion – it is important that the privileged have a mindset of equity that allows them to share from their abundance. “It is with this mindset of equity that prosperous communities are built and the fight against corruption is won.” He also added that to become successful in life, one has to be trustworthy. He explained that being trusted goes hand-in-hand with trustworthiness, adding that trustworthiness was a culmination of ability, integrity and benevolence.

Governor Yahaya Bello is desperately canvassing for indirect primaries because he has already selected delegates who will do his bidding in the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship primary, Omoba Tunde Ajibulu, a chieftain of the party said. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Speaking in an interview with INDEPENDENT, Ajibulu, a member of the Logistics Department of the APC Presidential campaign council also expressed optimism that Mohammed Audu, eldest son of the late Prince Abubakar Audu will emerge victorious in a free, fair and credible primary. “I am supporting Mohammed Audu because I believe he is the best out of the governorship aspirants that have come out so far. I have always argued that if APC is serious about winning the election, then our flagbearer must emerge from Kogi East and that also gives Mohammed an edge. “Mohammed Audu will bring succour to Kogi State people, he will bring vibrancy back to the economy,  he will device means to boost the IGR and he will open up Lokoja town amongst many other things”. “I have no doubt that Mohammed Audu will emerge winner in a free and fair direct primary elections”. On why he is opposed to indirect primary method, Ajibulu said he is canvassing for direct primary because he wants a situation where all members of Kogi APC are given the opportunity to determine their governorship candidate as done in states like Lagos in the just concluded general elections. “Of course,  the indirect primary is definitely skewing things Yahaya Bello’s way. What is the big deal indirect primaries? Only Bello wants indirect primaries so he can appoint the delegates”. “We want every APC card-carrying member in Kogi to exercise their lawful right in selecting their flag bearer,” he said.

For the first time in over three years, since a 0-0 draw with Newcastle in May 2016, Premier League football is back at Villa Park. In their exile, Saturday’s opponents Bournemouth have become mainstays of the division. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Both sides suffered late setbacks on the opening weekend. A Harry Kane brace earned Tottenham a comeback victory over Villa, while Billy Sharp rescued a point for Sheffield United at Bournemouth. For Dean Smith it will be an emotional moment, taking charge of his boyhood club at Villa Park and back in the top flight of English football. Three points at the weekend would set them on the right path for the season ahead, but Eddie Howe’s side are a tough test. It has been a long time since Aston Villa won in the Premier League – February 6, 2016. Defeat at Spurs has stretched the run to 14 winless games. Seven of them, at the tail-end of 2015-16, were at home. Villa Park, on a good day, can be one of the most intimidating grounds in England and Villa desperately need to make it a Premier League fortress once more. It should be an awkward place for the big teams to go, it should be a long 90 minutes for the smaller clubs. Villa’s Premier League woes are symbolised most acutely by star man Jack Grealish. The opening weekend loss was a 19th straight defeat for the young midfielder in the competition.

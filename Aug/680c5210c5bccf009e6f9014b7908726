LAGOS – Enyimba International of Aba have expressed optimism of defeating Rahimo FC of Burkina Faso despite the sanction placed on their fans stopping them from coming into the stadium in the match billed for Sunday. Afelokhai, the Enyimba goalkeeper, while speaking with Brila FM, noted that they would overturn the 0-1 loss they suffered in the first leg because following the loss, the eighth-time Nigerian champions need outright victory to beat their Burkinababe counterparts. The player called for corporation among the players for them to get the desired result in the match they must win to move ahead, even though he said that playing without their fans might put a huge challenge to them in the game. “Honestly, we just need to win the game, playing behind closed doors is not good because the supporters would have made things a lot easier for us but I don’t think that will be enough excuse for us not to win the match and qualify. “We need to come out to play our way. Honestly as footballers we feel somehow when we heard that we are going to play behind closed doors. “But we just need to encourage ourselves and Enyimba is too big to get knocked out of the preliminary stage of the champions league.”

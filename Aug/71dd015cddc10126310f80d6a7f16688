Brazil’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Friday that it received
approval from the United States to the appointment of Brazilian
president’s son Eduardo Bolsonaro as ambassador to the country,
according to Xinhuanet.com reports. The “agreement” request, as the consultation is called, was sent in
late July to the U.S. Department of State, and Brazil got a positive
response, the foreign ministry’s press office said. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The nomination of Eduardo Bolsonaro, son of president Jair Bolsonaro,
still needs to be approved by the Brazilian Senate, according to law. If the Senate approves his appointment, he will conduct “intense and
arduous work,” said Eduardo Bolsonaro after meeting with Brazilian
Foreign Minister Ernesto Araujo. There will be “a truly strategic direction to deepen cooperation
(between both countries) and to promote security, prosperity and the
well-being of all the Brazilian and American people,” he said. Eduardo Bolsonaro, who has just turned 35, the minimum required age to
occupy an ambassador’s position, is a federal representative and heads
the Foreign Relations Committee under the House. The Brazilian embassy in Washington has been left without an
ambassador since April when Bolsonaro removed the previous one.

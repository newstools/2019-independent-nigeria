MINNA- The crisis rocking the ranks of the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC) in Niger State has taken a new dimension with the screening and endorsement of the state’s Ministerial nominee, Ambassador Zubairu Dada by the Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The crisis which first reared its head when the Governor, Alhaji Abubarkar Sani Bello made first three key appointments; Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Head of Service and the Chief of Staff Government House. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network While many had celebrated the appointment of the Chief of Staff as a card-carrying member of the APC, the party in Niger state is however divided over the appointment of the SSG and Head of Service both believed to be non-card carrying members of the party. The recent screening and endorsement of Niger state Ministerial nominee, Ambassador Zubairu Dada, whose name was said to have been forwarded by the Governor himself is threatening the ranks of the party. Consequently, Niger state APC has rejected the nomination of Ambassador Zubairu Dada and in addition posited that Governor Bello who is also the leader of the party in the state ‘acted alone’ in the submission of his name to President Muhammadu Buhari. Rising from its enlarged stakeholders’ meeting yesterday, the APC in the state said it has become clear to them that Zubairu Dada “Is not a card-carrying member of the APC’ and campaigned for the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) during the run-up to the last general elections and as such should not have been given the slot”.

I hope Steve Bruce can do well at Newcastle. He is a friend of mine and if there is anyone I want to achieve success at the club, it is him. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network After replacing Rafael Benitez in the summer, he started the season with two defeats – 1-0 against Arsenal on the opening day and last weekend’s 3-1 loss at newly promoted Norwich. Those results will have hurt him. But you have the chance to respond on the pitch and he and his players did that in the perfect way at Tottenham on Sunday. The 1-0 victory at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is a huge result for Steve because it has been a tough start for him. He has had two poor results, including one very poor performance. This will be massive for his confidence and for the players too. They are back to winning ways, and not only got a result away from home but got one at Spurs. Not many people would have thought they could go there and win in the way they did and they thoroughly deserved it. The set-up was spot on and the players seemed to be very happy with the style Bruce implemented. You could not fault their performance and it was 10/10 from all the players from the first minute until the last. That was in contrast to last weekend when he said himself he was bitterly disappointed. As bad as last week’s performance was, this week was equally good. The whole team deserves praise. It was totally the opposite to what we saw at Norwich. They were very well organised, disciplined and there were so many positives. There was no space for Spurs to exploit whatsoever. We hope those are the signs of a team moving forward. It will give everyone belief for their upcoming games – in their next three matches they face Leicester in the Carabao Cup, bottom side Watford in the Premier League and then Liverpoo

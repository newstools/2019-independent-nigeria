LAGOS – The Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) said it is collaborating with terminal operators to curb the menace of pilferages perpetrated by criminals at the ports. Engr. Adams Jatto, the General Manager, Corporate Affairs Department of the authority, disclosed this on Friday in a chat with journalists. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network He said that even though each terminal was responsible for its security, the authority would collaborate with them to stem the ugly trend. Recall that there were two cases of container pilferages at Ports and Cargo Terminal, Tincan Port Complex recently. One of the cases involved removal of the side mirror of a containerised car and the vandalisation of Air force cargo in the same terminal. He maintained that the security operatives of NPA and terminal operators would have to heighten security by screening those that enter the port to identify who they are and their mission in the port. “Our responsibility lies in the common user areas and we have kept wharf rats away from the port for a long time now. “Since concession, it has become the responsibilities of terminal operators to take up the security of their individual terminals. “But definitely, we will do something about it, NPA will collaborate with terminal operators to rid the ports of the influx of wharf rats. “By working with our security department and the terminal operators, we will make sure that people that come into the terminal are screened to know the calibre of people that come into the port,” he said.

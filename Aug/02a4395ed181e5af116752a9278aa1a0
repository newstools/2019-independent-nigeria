the jailed former finance minister in Brazil has said in plea bargain testimony that beverage giant Ambev SA (ABEV3.SA) made “inappropriate payments” to former presidents Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff, according to a newspaper report. Brazilian newspaper Estado de S. Paulo, citing confidential court documents, said former Finance Minister Antonio Palocci told federal police he also personally received payments from the company that he said was aimed at preventing an increase in beverage taxes.

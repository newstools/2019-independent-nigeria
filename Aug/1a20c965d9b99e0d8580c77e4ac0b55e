Powered by RubiQube Ad Network According to the police, Ehindero approached the car dealer identified as Jamiu requesting for a Toyota Highlander to purchase for the purpose of evangelism. He, however, sped off with the vehicle in the process of test-driving it after both parties had agreed on a price. The pastor had allegedly sold the vehicle for N600,000 in Ore, Ondo State, before going into hiding. The pastor was however arrested after Jamiu reported the matter to the Deputy Commissioner of Police in charge of FSARS, Lagos, Kola Kamaldeen, who directed a team led by SP Olaniyi Festus to go after the suspect and recover the vehicle.

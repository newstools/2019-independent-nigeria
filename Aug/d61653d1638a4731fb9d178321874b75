Paris Saint-Germain are set to reject an expected loan offer from Barcelona for wantaway striker Neymar, according to ESPN FC sources. Earlier on Monday, ESPN FC sources in Barcelona said that the Catalans were set to make a loan offer for Neymar with an option to buy next summer, but it appears that proposal would be dead on arrival in Paris. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The Parisians expect the loan offer to land on Tuesday or Wednesday, but that option does not suit the Ligue 1 holders, according to sources. PSG’s Qatari owners have been disappointed by the attitude of Neymar this summer and are ready to let him leave, but only if they can recoup as much of the €222 million they spent to bring him to Paris in the summer of 2017. There is also the belief in Paris that Barcelona will not be able to pay the transfer fee in one lump sum next summer should they make the move permanent and would ask to pay in annual installments, which is not ideal for the French club. PSG sporting director Leonardo is trying to get as much money in cash as possible for Neymar, hoping to recoup at least €200m. The situation is further complicated by Philippe Coutinho’s loan move to Bayern Munich, making a potential deal for Neymar harder to pull off as PSG had hoped the Barcelona midfielder could be a makeweight in some kind of cash-plus-players deal. Neymar still wants to leave the Parc des Princes this summer and his preference is to go back to Barcelona where he played between 2013 and 2017. Sources say the Brazilian superstar is trying to stay positive but he knows that a deal to see him returning to the Camp Nou is getting more and more difficult.

AWKA – The member representing Anaocha/Dunukofia/Njikoka Federal Constituency, Valentine Ayika, at the weekend donated five trips of big stones, which were poured on the Amansea-Ugwuoba portions of the ever-busy Enugu-Onitsha expressway to alleviate the suffering of commuters. Since last week, the road got so deplorable that it took motorists between three to four hours to pass that portion as they head to Enugu or come to Anambra. Because the Enugu-Onitsha expressway way has been in disuse for a long time, the old road remained the only access to Enugu from Anambra State. But Ayika feeling for motorists deployed five tipper-loads of big stones to the dilapidated portions and called on other people of goodwill to make their own input pending when the governments intervened. Ayika said the rainy season was having a grave destructive effect on parts of the road, which had made it a nightmare for motorists using it

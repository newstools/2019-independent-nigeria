LAGOS – Falcons Head Coach, Thomas Dennerby, has assured that the team will not relent on its oars on Tuesday despite beating Algeria 2-0 away in the first leg of the 2020 Olympics Women’s football qualifiers. The second leg of the qualifiers will hold on Tuesday at Agege, Lagos with the winner qualifying for the final round of the qualifiers.

The players have been told to complete the task on a high note. “The players would still play their normal game and prove that the victory in Blida is not a fluke by ensuring another victory in Lagos,” he said. Dennerby had taken only home-based professionals to Blida with foreign-based stars opting out due to club commitments and it proved an opportunity for the home girls to make a statement. They are expected in Lagos today, where they will begin preparation for the second leg. Meanwhile, the Algerian delegation to the match will also land in Lagos on Friday.

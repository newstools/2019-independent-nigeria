Chance The Rapper was upstaged by NF, a lesser-known Christian rapper with a faithful following, on the Billboard 200 chart this week. The 28-year-old Michigan native whose real name is Nathan Feuerstein has had many comparisons to one of his childhood influences, Eminem, but without the explicit lyrics, according to an interview with NME, a music website. He endured several hardships growing up that turned him on to rap, including his mother’s overdose in 2009. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network I want to thank every single fan who supported me by buying this album,” NF wrote in a note on social media. “I put my life into this and to see this much support means a lot to me…thank you to my label for letting me do whatever I want creatively since day one. The fans made this album #1, and I am forever grateful.”

Powered by RubiQube Ad Network It would be recalled that CAC had extended the business names registration following the directive of the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, that the window should be extended for 90 days effective from May 13, 2019 to August 13, 2019. Meanwhile, Adaguusu told DAILY INDEPENDENT in a chat that CAC had from October1st, 2018 to July 31st, 2019, registered a total of 220,773 Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). He further noted that “The list is growing day by day,” as registration has continued. On the three-day extension of registration, he added that it would enable the operators of MSMEs who could not register their businesses during the promo because of the Sallah holidays to do so. While explaining the benefits of business names registration, he said the registration of their businesses would enable them to own corporate accounts with banks, have access to loans, grants and other government interventions. He, therefore, urged operators of the MSMEs to take advantage of the three-day extension to register their businesses at reduced cost of N5, 000. He pointed out that registration can be done online or at any CAC’s offices nationwide.

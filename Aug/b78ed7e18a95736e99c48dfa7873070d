ABUJA – The Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) and residents of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), on Wednesday in Abuja, asked the Commissioner of Police in the nation’s capital to raise a crack team that would flush out the rising waves of crimes in the territory. The NUJ and the residents, at a town hall meeting on insecurities in the FCT put together by the NUJ, FCT Council, were unanimous in their views that kidnapping, armed robbery and ritual killings, amongst other heinous crimes, were fast taking over the territory. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network In their separate addresses at the security summit, Chris Isiguzo, NUJ president and Emmanuel Ogbeche, chairman of the FCT Council, appealed to the residents to give police all the supports needed to resolve the crisis. Ogbeche informed that the meeting on rising security challenges in the FCT was strategically organised to have the people engage the police to deliver on their core mandate of protection of lives and property. He said the town hall meeting was in view of daily reports and citizens’ apprehension of emerging threats that seek to undermine the safety, security and general well-being of FCT residents. He also noted that the media was rife with reports of petty and vicious crimes in the FCT and added that there are many questions begging for answers on this issue. Some FCT residents and other critical stakeholders at the event in their interventions, called on the Nigeria Police Force FCT Command to provide the citizenry particularly those resident in the nation’s capital with the constitutionally guaranteed right to protection of lives and property. Emmanuel Onwubiko of the Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria HURIWA particularly called on the Police authorities to overhaul their operational strategies in crime fighting. Nontheless, FCT Police Commissioner Bala Ciroma and his predecessor Lawrence Alobi, applauded the efforts of officers and men of the force in the territory in tackling the insecurities.

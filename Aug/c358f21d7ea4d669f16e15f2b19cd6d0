Queen Elizabeth II approved Wednesday U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s request to “prorogue,” or suspend, Parliament between the second week of September and Oct. 14. Between the lines: In a letter to lawmakers, Johnson said he had asked the queen to suspend Parliament to give his government a fresh chance to set out a “new bold and ambitious domestic agenda.” While this may be grounded in some truth, the real purpose of the dramatic move is to limit the amount of time opposition members of Parliament have to block a “no-deal” Brexit, the default — and potentially disastrous — legal option on Oct. 31, Basu reports for Axios. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The big picture: The prime minister typically asks the queen — historically, an apolitical figure — to prorogue Parliament once a year in order to bring an end to legislative business. When Parliament returns for its new session, the queen makes a speech setting out the government’s agenda. The state of play: Johnson was elected leader of the Conservative Party on the promise that he will deliver Brexit on Oct. 31 “do or die” — with or without a deal. A majority of members of Parliament oppose a no-deal Brexit, which experts and even Johnson’s own government admit could cause shortages of food, fuel, medicine and more. What they’re saying: Activists and politicians who oppose leaving without a deal are outraged that Johnson has taken the extreme step of undercutting Parliament’s power at such a critical moment. What’s next? Parliament will return from recess to sit for a short session next week, during which lawmakers are expected to take steps to block a no-deal Brexit in the limited time they have.

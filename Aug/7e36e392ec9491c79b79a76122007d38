Aba – Amaise Umokerekengwa youths have tasked the police to be diligent and ensure that the prosecution of Ajayi Johnson, who was dismissed from the army for murdering Chimaobi Nwaogu, an okada rider from Abia State was accelerated. Lance Corporal Ajayi Johnson, who allegedly shot Chimaobi Nwaogu, an okada rider from Amaise Umuokerekengwa in Obingwa, Abia State, over N100 bribe, was yesterday dismissed from the army and handed over to Abia State Police Command for prosecution. Colonel Aliyu Yusuf, deputy director, Army Public Relations, said Ajayi was demoted to the rank of private before his dismissal. President, Amaise Umuokerekengwa Youths Forum, Chika Isigwe, in a chat with Daily Independent, commended the army for a swift discharge of the responsibility. Isigwe, who also commended Governor Okezie Ikpeazu for his unrelenting efforts,added that the fate of the dismissed soldier has sent strong signals to other trigger- happy soldiers who derive joy in sending innocent Nigerians to their early graves. “We commend the army authorities for the swift action. This will serve as a deterrent to other trigger- happy soldiers, who are queuing behind Johnson to send other innocent Nigerians to their untimely grave,” Isigwe said. He, therefore, called on Abia State Police Command to ensure an accelerated and diligent prosecution in the case. “The family of the deceased is eagerly waiting for justice to be done on this issue. We are praying for an accelerated and diligent prosecution of the culprit. “The prosecution should be accelerated because, ‘justice delayed’, they say ‘is justice denied. “On the other hand, we pray for diligent prosecution so that the culprit won’t escape justice. Because they say that it is better to set free one million innocent citizens than for one guilty person to go free, “Isigwe enthused.

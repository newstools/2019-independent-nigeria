A chieftain of the All Pro­gressives Congress (APC), Dr. Olusegun Osinkolu, has urged President Muham­madu Buhari to enlist the support of local hunters in the ongoing fight against banditry and kidnappings. Osinkolu, the Director General of Buhari/Osin­bajo Campaign Council in Ekiti State in the 2019 pres­idential election, also ap­pealed to Nigerians to stop the blame game. In a statement in Ado Ekiti on Monday, Osinkolu said it was obvious that Bu­hari is making progress in the fight against ferocious insurgency in the North­east before bandits and kid­nappings resurged in the Northwest and southwest regions. He assured that ef­forts would also be made to abate the menace as done in the Northeast. He urged them to join hands with the All Progres­sives Congress-led Federal Government to rid the na­tion of bandits, terrorists and kidnappers that are making Nigeria look inse­cure. Osinkolu said the current development whereby some sections of the country are experiencing killings and kidnappings of citizens and expatriates should not make Nigerians to lose hope in the Buhari’s presidency “President Buhari in­herited from Dr. Goodluck Jonathan a highly vicious insurgency in the North where about 35,000 people had been killed and 1.8 mil­lion displaced from their homes in the Northeast. “The President took up the fight and he succeeded in decimating them and those displaced were al­ready returning home when suddenly bandits and kid­nappers reared their ugly heads in other regions.”

LAGOS – The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR),at the weekend punctured the recent United Kingdom’s verdict which awarded $9bn claims against Nigeria for breach of gas contractual agreement with an Irish-owned firm, Process and Industrial Developments Limited. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Ahmed Shakur, Acting Director of the agency, who echoed this in an exclusive interview with our correspondent in Lagos, said the Irish company ought to explore gas to power plant while the Federal Government was supposed to put in place the pipeline but the former didn’t fulfil its obligations. The director posited that the verdict against Nigeria was given in bad faith as the Irish company failed its share of the agreement which didn’t not give the federal government requisite strength to lay the pipeline in fulfillment of the contractual obligation. He maintained that the company didn’t hitherto put any facility in place in Nigeria, which shows it’s not interested in executing the contract It would be recalled that an Irish-owned firm, Process and Industrial Developments Ltd (P&ID) had last week granted court permission to seize up to $9bn (£7.4bn) in assets belonging to the Nigerian government. Mr Justice Christopher John Butcher of the British Commercial Court said that the firm can take 20 per cent of Nigeria’s foreign reserves, a move that would deal a devastating blow to the Nigerian economy. In 2010, the company struck a deal in which the Nigerian government would supply gas to a processing plant in Calabar, built and run by P&ID, formed by two Irish businessmen. The government failed to fulfil its side of the agreement. However, in 2013 P&ID won a $6.6bn arbitration case. The figure was calculated based on what the company was estimated to have earned over the course of the 20- year agreement.

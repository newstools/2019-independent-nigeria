LAGOS – A shipping operator, Mrs. Margret Orawusi, has said that the transportation sector in Nigeria could not be effective with the current regulatory issues in place. Orakwusi, who is the Chairperson, Nigeria Ship-Owners Forum, said in Lagos that stakeholders were anxious about the National Transport Commission (NTC) Bill as a way of overcoming that challenges. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Orakwusi advocated the return to the drawing board for the expected change to occur, arguing further that transportation in the county must be properly regulated. She explained that in terms of infrastructure, the emergence of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) meant that Nigeria had to drive efficiency at its ports, adding that it also had to ensure that the infrastructure would carry the volume of goods the country was whether for import or export. “We already know the condition of the ports and the connecting roads to the ports. There has been an improvement in the railway that has been connected to the ports but we hope to see more improvement,” she added. She said that aside the ports in Lagos, it was also important that the ports in other parts of the country came to life. She added that beyond infrastructure, Nigeria also needed to have a single-window platform that would allow seamless cargo clearance. “We need to be a nation operating in 21st century with the use of modern technology. We can’t continue to use human beings because the opportunity for human interface usually leads to corruption and extortion,” she said.

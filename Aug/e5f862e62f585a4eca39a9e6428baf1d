KATSINA – Recent nutrition sur­vey indices have indicated that Se­vere Acute Malnu­trition (SAM) is still on the high side in Katsina State. The indices as quoted by Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC) states that Multiple Indica­tor Cluster Survey (MICS) puts stunting in the state in 2017 at 35 percent while Oxford Policy Management (OPM) on nutritional smart survey puts stunting in 58.0 percent in 2018 respectively. It also put SAM at 4.1 percent for children under five years in 2017 while in 2018 it was3.0 percent and underweight at 18.5 percent in 2017 while in 2018, it was 31.4 percent respectively. Chioma Kanu, the CIS­LAC Programme Manag­er, who disclosed this at a one-day engagement with women and youth groups on prevention and treat­ment of Severe Acute Mal­nutrition in the state, said instead of decreasing, it was on the increase. She solicited the support of women and youths in the state to join hands and lend their voices to tackle the ugly menace. “It is unfortunate that we have these indices. It is sur­prising when we are not in war. “We engage the women and youths to help advance nutrition. We have engaged other critical stakeholders like the government, tradi­tional leaders, the media and that is why we are engaging the women and youth groups. “Should we fail to act now and lend our voice, things will be deteriorating. The time to act is now to save our children from dying need­less deaths,” she posited. She added that women should create community awareness on availability and use of Ready-To-Use- Therapeutic-Food (RUTF). Monitor and report stock out of RUTF to local authorities. According to her, women should stage level conven­tions, town hall meetings and dialogue sessions to discuss SAM. Chioma, therefore, urged women groups to drive the advocacy for full implemen­tation of Child Rights Act in the state which makes nutri­tion the rights of a child.

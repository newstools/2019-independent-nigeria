Arsenal and Barcelona have a lot of history, especially regarding transfers. The likes of Thierry Henry and Cesc Fabregas travelled from Noth London to Barcelona in recent history and there are bound to be many more examples in the future. However, Arsenal could be on the lucky receiving end this time around. According to The Sun, the Gunners are set for talks with Barcelona. It’s thought the move is for a loan for Philippe Coutinho which could cost Unai Emery and company £27m. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Earlier in the week, there were talks that Barcelona were open to selling Coutinho and that they were in discussion with a Premier League club. Nobody, including myself, would have expected that side to be Arsenal. Arsenal are going through the perfect transfer window so far. They have announced the signings of Dani Ceballos, William Saliba and most recently, Nicolas Pepe. If they were to sign Coutinho on a two-season long loan deal, then they would have one of the best attacks in the league. Philippe Coutinho has already impressed in the Premier League for consecutive seasons. The ex-Liverpool man was crowned as one of the best creators in the league before leaving for a new adventure in Catalunya. Coutinho is a very attack-minded midfielder who likes to take control with the ball at his feet. He is an excellent dribbler and passer, which brings out the best in his teammates. It also helps that he is an excellent free-kick taker and has the ability to take on shots from all over the pitch. Unai Emery is starting to find out what works and what doesn’t work for Arsenal. They are beginning to find the right philosophy and if the new transfers are anything to go by, then the Gunners are in for an impressive season and they may even achieve what they set out to achieve last season.

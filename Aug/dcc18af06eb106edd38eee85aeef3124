migrant rescue ship while it continues to seek a port where another
151 passengers can get off, according to Apnews.com reports. Open Arms said two women – one with a brain tumour and the other with
pneumonia – and six of their relatives were transferred to Malta on
Monday. A man with health issues was moved to Italy on Sunday. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The aid group says its eponymous boat still hasn’t received permission
to disembark in a European port 12 days after it rescued 123 migrants
in the Mediterranean Sea. The crew picked up 39 more migrants on
Saturday. Italy’s Lampedusa island has the nearest port. The country banned both
the Open Arms and a Norwegian-flagged rescue ship which is carrying
251 migrants.

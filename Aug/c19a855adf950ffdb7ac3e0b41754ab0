Nigerians on Twitter and other social media platforms have continued to react negatively, and rightly so, after the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), following instructions from the United State of America (USA) authorities, on Thursday made public a list of 80 names of Nigerians involved in what has been described as “one of the largest cases of internet fraud in the history of the United States” following the arrest of the said individuals. In a 145-page document unsealed on Thursday, the FBI stated that many of the fraud and money laundering suspects were Nigerians who were part of an international syndicate which has been skimming people and organisations off their monies. Some of the reactions on Twitter are seen below: Summary effects of Yahoo Yahoo in the United States: ~this year alone, the FBI Internet Crime Complain center received nearly 14,000 complaints from victims. ~total loss of more than $1.1Bn from victims( greater than all 2018 loses) This is Terrifying!pic.twitter.com/tPS4uaQY5b — TallJohn (@JohnFanimokun) August 22, 2019  No herdsmen?!

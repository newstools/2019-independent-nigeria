ABA – Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide has expressed opposition to the proposed closure of Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu. Daily Independent reported that the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) recently notified airlines and passengers that the runway at Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu, will be closed on Saturday, August 24, for major repairs. General Manager, Corporate Affairs of FAAN, Henrietta Yakubu, explained that the closure was aimed at resolving the existing safety and security concerns to flight operations. Reacting to the proposed closure, the apex Igbo socio-cultural group urged the Federal Government not to close the airport until the contract for its rehabilitation is concretely signed. The group’s spokesman, Chuks Ibegbu, demanded that the airport be upgraded to a true international airport with offices of aviation agencies and international airlines located at within the premises. Ibegbu also lauded Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State for his decision to build an airport within Afikpo area. He added that it would open up the state’s access with other parts of Igbo land. He called for the dredging of Aba River to boost the industrial potentials of the city.

Stephanie Frappart will become the first female official to take charge of a major UEFA competition match when Liverpool face Chelsea in the Super Cup in Istanbul on August 14, European soccer’s governing body said on Friday. Frappart, 35, was the first female referee to officiate a French Ligue 1 match when she took charge of Amiens against Strasbourg in April and also became the first woman to be named in the pool of Ligue 1 referees for next season.

Her assistants from that game in Lyon (Manuela Nicolosi and Michelle O’Neal) will be on the team of officials for UEFA’s curtain raiser to the season. “The potential for women’s football has no limits and I am delighted that Stephanie Frappart has been appointed to officiate at this year’s UEFA Super Cup,” UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin said in a statement.

Israel’s Delek Group said on Monday it was in talks with a range of
investors to raise up to $300 million ahead of a planned listing of
its Ithaca Energy business, according to Reuters reports. Delek said it was negotiating with investment funds, trading companies
and international financial institutions to make a capital investment
against an allocation of shares in Ithaca. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network In May, Delek moved closer to a listing of Ithaca when it bought out
most of Chevron’s British North Sea oil and gas fields for $2 billion. In a regulatory filing in Tel Aviv, Delek also said that along with
Ithaca, it was in talks to sign oil and gas marketing agreements for
three years and receive payments of up to $150 million from
international trading firms. Delek expects to complete the Chevron transaction in the fourth
quarter. Ithaca has already received British regulatory approval to
gain control of Chevron’s North sea oil and gas fields.

P/HARCOURT – Apparently miffed by the prevailing insecurity and the attendant slow pace of work at the ongoing cleanup exercise, the factional President of the movement for the survival of Ogoni people, MOSOP, Fegalo Nsuke has called for the dissolution of the governing council of the hydrocarbon pollution remediation project, HYPREP. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Fegalo stated that the dissolution was necessary because of what he alleged as “overwhelming” corruption in the system. According to him, “the governing Council is corrupt and incompetent. They approved integrated water system for Ogoni people in 2017. N3.6billion has been spent without implementing that project to better the lots of Ogoni people. “We in MOSOP want an independent investigation set up to probe the finances of HYPREP. In doing that, this Governing Council must be set aside to avoid undue interferences,” Fegalo said. Faulting the allegation, the coordinator of HYPREP, Dr Marvin Dekil said the way HYPREP is structured does not in any way give room for any form of corruption.

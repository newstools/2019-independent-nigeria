Lagos – Chairman of the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission, Abike Dabiri-Erewa, has condemned in its entirety, the attack on the former deputy senate president, Senator Ike Ekweremadu at the 2nd Annual Igbo Cultural Festival held in Nuremberg, Germany.
Ekweremadu who was attending as a speaker/special guest of honor at the event organised by the Ndigbo Germany community was reportedly beaten up and egged publicly. While describing the attack as an embarrassment to the country, Dabiri-Erewa in a statement personally signed by her said, “According to reliable sources, some of the culprits who perpetrated the act have been apprehended and we call on the German government and law enforcement agencies to ensure that there are consequences for their actions.

YOLA – Councillors of Girei Local Government Area of Ad­amawa State have made all arrangements to impeach the Transition Committee Chairman of the council area over alleged miscon­duct. The councillors, while serving a letter of invita­tion to the chairman (TCC) Bello Wudini, said he was wanted to answer ques­tions bordering on serious allegations of misconduct levelled against him. Wudini was given only two days to appear before the councillors and ex­plain why he would not be impeached for allegedly executing capital projects without approval from the councillors as provid­ed by the TCC guidelines and as also passed by the Adamawa State House of Assembly. They said Bello Wudini out rightly violated many key points of the opera­tional guidelines of the TCC, saying that he had severally abused point 16 of the guidelines which stip­ulated that the chairman can approve not more than N250.000 which he should seek the involvement of the councillors, but that he has been exceeding that amount without calling the attention of the councillors or the Ministry of Local Government and Chieftain­cy Affairs.

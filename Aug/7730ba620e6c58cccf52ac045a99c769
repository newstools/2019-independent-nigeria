AKURE – Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has declared that it is commencing ‘Operation No Mercy’ as the festive seasons set it. Head, Special Operations, FRSC Ondo State Command, Mr. Segun Ogungbemide, said this on Sunday in Akure, the Ondo State capital, at the 9th edition of Ondo State Media Award. He seized the opportunity to educate the audience on traffic laws, lamenting that road users in the country treat traffic laws with levity. At award ceremony, no fewer than 10 personalities were given awards for distinguishing themselves
in their various lines of endeavours, among whom was the state correspondent of Television Continental (TVC) Ayo Moradeyo, who won TV Reporter Of The Year Award. The road marshal lamented that most of the crashes recorded were preventable, but due to carelessness of drivers several lives were being lost everyday on the highways. According to him, road crashes have claimed more lives than HIV/AIDS, adding that no fewer than 15 crashes occurred at different locations in the state in the last 24 hours. He charged every road user to adhere strictly to traffic laws as they were meant to save lives.

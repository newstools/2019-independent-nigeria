Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has hailed Mason Greenwood as the best finisher at Manchester United, ahead of both Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial. Greenwood is yet to score a competitive goal for United, but Solskjaer said he has seen enough during preseason and in training to believe that the 17-year-old is the best natural goalscorer at Old Trafford. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Asked whether Rashford or Martial is the most natural finisher in the squad, Solskjaer said: “They’ve still got a way to go, because Mason’s more of a natural finisher than them.” Greenwood has been earmarked for a key role this season, following the departure of Romelu Lukaku. The Belgium international’s move to Inter Milan has also placed an extra goal-scoring burden on Rashford and Martial, and Solskjaer has told the pair the way to do it is by getting more “easy” goals.

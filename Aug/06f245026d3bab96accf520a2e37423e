Thank you, Mr. President, for honouring my late father. You have indeed disgraced his enemies. Your action smacks of nobility and integrity. That is what Mrs. Hafsat Olaronke Abiola-Costello seems to be telling President Muhammadu Buhari, while on her knees, when she joined 61 other persons from Ogun State last week to pay a “Thank You” visit to the President for honouring Nigeria’s democracy icon, late Bashorun Moshood Kasimawo Olawale Abiola.

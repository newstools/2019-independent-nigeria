Mt Kenya University says it is considering setting up e-campuses in Angola, to tap into growing government-to-government links between Nairobi and Luanda. At the Kenya-Angola Trade and Investment Conference 2019 last week, Dr Vincent Gaitho, the Vice-Chairman of MKU said the institution wants to ride on recent bilateral policies that have started to open up markets between the two countries. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network “There are huge opportunities that remain untapped between the two countries,” he told the Nation after the conference in which some top industry leaders from Kenya and Angola met in Luanda for what they called “intelligence gathering” on markets. E-LEARNING Though Dr Gaitho did not specify on timelines, he indicated MKU is discussing with Angolan authorities on the possibility of setting up e-learning centres of physical campuses, as well as language exchange programmes for students from both sides to learn English, Portuguese and Kiswahili. “Students will be encouraged to break geographical distances and pursue studies in MKU programmes in Angola. Through education, we can interlink Africa and make her competitive in the globalised world.”

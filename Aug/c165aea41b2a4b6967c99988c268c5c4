He is a pride to all of us. When he talks he does that with a sense of commitment and realisation. “Oil companies that are leaving the Niger Delta and relocating to Lagos are disobeying the laws of this country.

You don’t operate in the Niger Delta and reside in Lagos. “Senator Omo-Agege is among others calling on the oil companies that have left
the Niger Delta for Lagos to return. “He is saying that oil blocs should be allotted to the people of the region. He is saying that oil pipelines surveillance contract should be given to our youths. His agitations and philosophies are the same with ours,” Emuh stated. Emuh expressed happiness on the recent reconciliation of the splinter groups within the HOSTCOM, adding that the action would now make the organisation to speak with one voice in its agitations and thus have concrete achievements. He appealed to the executives of the Delta State chapter of HOSTCOM to work in harmony with the newly reconstituted board of the Delta State Oil and Gas Producing Areas Development Commission, DESOPADEC for the betterment of the living condition of the people. “We should support Governor Okowa (of Delta State) and the DESOPADEC so that rapid development can be brought to bear on the oil and gas producing communities in the state,” he concluded.

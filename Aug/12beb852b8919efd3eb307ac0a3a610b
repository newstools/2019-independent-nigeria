Owing to increased supplies from some northern states and other neighbouring countries such as Ghana and Benin Republic, prices of fresh tomatoes and pepper which soared sharply during the Sallah celebrations have eventually come down in the week under review. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Many of the traders, however, opined that the decline was not really significant as the amount spent in buying their normal supplies was still on the high side, owing to the fact that the season of harvest has not commenced fully. According to the traders, prices of the produce would crash further between late September and October, being the season of bountiful harvest. Consumers appeared to be discouraged at what they were being offered by traders as some of them still had to buy tomato paste to augment the fresh produce to reduced spending. During the week, visits to some markets across the states by the Business and Market Intelligence Unit of SUNDAY INDEPENDENT, showed that prices of the produce especially fresh tomatoes witnessed a downward trend of over 30 per cent from what was sold last week Thursday, August 15, 2019. Reason for the decline was attributed to increased supply and drop in patronage. In Ogbeogologo Market, Asaba, prices of the produce were at a sliding trend especially when compared with what they were earlier sold. For example, prices of a big basket of fresh tomatoes which soared at between N10,500 and N11,500 last week decreased, currently ranging from N8,000 to N9,000 but this depends on the size of the basket and haggling power of the buyer. That of fresh pepper, despite the fall in its prices, was still on the high side, currently going for between N13,000 and N13,800 as against N15,000 sold in the previous week. Madam Rebecca, who retails the produce at the Ogbeogologo Market, Asaba, said the slight drop in the prices of the produce was responsible for the marginal increase in supply since the season of harvest has not begun. That of Ose Market, Onitsha, was same but reducing slightly from what was obtained the previous week. For example, prices of a basket fresh tomatoes which attracted N10,000 last week fell to between N8,000 and N8,500 while that of a bag of fresh pepper also witnessed a slide, currently selling for N12,500 down from  N14,500 sold last week. Many of the traders in a chat with our correspondent linked the situation to seasonal factors and poor patronage. Checks at the Oba Market, Benin City, revealed that prices of fresh tomatoes and pepper which appeared to be beyond reach last week because of the Sallah celebrations, declined within the review week. A basket of tomatoes sold for between N15,000 and N16,000 last week reduced during the week to between N9,000 and N10,000. Likewise, that of a bag of fresh pepper, currently going for N12,000 down from N14,500 sold in the previous week. A man named Kafar Abdul, who trades in the produce at the Oba Market, Benin City, attributed the trend to improved supply. This is just as another trader named Bilikiis of the same market shared similar opinion, but principally connected the situation to the onset of its season of plenty which would be more evident next month. In Itam Market, Uyo, prices of a basket of fresh tomatoes fell within the region of N9,000 and N10,000 from N15,000 it earlier attracted. At the Dei-Dei Market, Abuja, prices of the produce were at a sliding trend especially with the prices of  a basket of fresh tomatoes going for between N6,000 and N6,700 from N8,500 sold last week while that of fresh pepper also declined to N10,000 from N13,000 sold last week. Many of the traders at the Dei-Dei Market, Abuja, connected the situation to availability usually associated with seasonal factors. The same could be said for that of Achau Market, Kaduna, as prices of a basket of fresh tomatoes sold for between N7,000 and N7,500  last week dropped, currently ranging from N6,000 to N6,500 depending on the size of the basket and bargaining power of the buyer. For Lafenwa Market, Ogun State, prices of a basket of fresh tomatoes declined to between N9,000 and N10,000 from N14,500 sold previous week. That of a bag of fresh pepper also fell within the region of N13,000 and N14,500 from N18,000 sold during the Sallah celebrations, last week. Mrs. Shadiat Alimi, a trader at the Lafenwa Market, Ogun State, ascribed the reduction in prices to increased supply and low demand. For Bodija Market, Ibadan, prices of the produce were at a downward trend particularly when compared with what they were sold last week; for instance, prices of a basket of fresh tomatoes sold in the previous week for between N13,500 and N14,500 dropped to between N7,000 and N7,500 in the week under  review. This, however, depends on the size of the basket, the quality and the bargaining power of the customer. A lady who came to shop for food items at the Bodija Market, Ibadan, in a chat with SUNDAY INDEPENDENT, said the decrease in the produce did not reflect greatly in the purchases of those who procured the produce in smaller quantities. In Lagos, visit to popular Mile 12 Market, revealed that there was actually improvement in supply as the number of trucks seen offloading the consignment had increased from what they were especially during scarcity. This had a positive effect on the prices of the produce as a basket of fresh tomatoes fell within the region of N7,000 andN8,000 from N15,000 sold last week. That of a solo bag of fresh pepper also reduced sharply to between N12,000 and N13,000 from N19,000 sold previously. Many of the traders at the Mile 12 Market, Lagos, linked the current trend to availability and were also very hopefully that prices of the produce would definitely crash the more during the season of abundance commencing next month.

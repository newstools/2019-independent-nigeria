UMUAHIA – Against the backdrop of the recent inauguration of an eight-man committee by the Abia State government to ease modality for the payment of arrears of salaries and pensions, state chapter of the United Labour Congress (ULC) has kicked against the inclusion of the state chairman of Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC), Uchenna Obigwe, in the committee. Governor Okezie Ikpeazu, represented by his deputy, Ude Okochukwu, who had inaugurated members of the committee at the Government House, Umuahia, gave the committee 14 working days to complete its assignment and hand in its recommendation to government. The committee has its membership drawn from the government’s side to include: Okey Ihedioha, Kelechi Imeoria and Dr. Anthony Agbazuere, a former state chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC). Others are the leadership of the organised labour in the state, including the NLC chairman, Uchenna Obigwe, the Trade Union chairman, Sunny Onwuma, chairman of the Joint Negotiating Council, Chris Okoro and Umah Kalu. However, in a swift reaction, Chairman of yet-to-be recognised organized Labour Union by the state government, ULC, Christopher Uche Ezekiel, accused his NLC counterpart of sabotaging the interest of workers in the state. He recalled that Obigwe headed the committee that handled the modality in the payment of workers’ salaries when the state received the two tranche of the Paris Refund as such was in the position to advise government then on best procedure to handle the payment.

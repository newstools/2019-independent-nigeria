On road infrastructure, he said the attention of his administration would shift to developing township and rural roads to stimulate the local economy, noting that efforts were also in top gear to initiate a bill that will establish the Public Works Agency in order for local technicians and professions in the building sector to create wealth for themselves as government was ready to employ people living within the corridors of the roads to be constructed to work on such projects. In his words, “the proposed Public Works Agency to be established through a new bill will stimulate the local economy through employment of people living in those corridors. Gone are the days we’ll employ foreigners to undertake road constructions.”

The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) on Monday assured Nigerians of a good outing for both the U-20 male and female teams at the 2019 African Games in Rabat, Morocco. NFF General Secretary, Mohammed Sanusi, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja that both teams had been well prepared for the Games’ football events. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Sanusi said the NFF had been working closely with the Federal Ministry of Youths and Sports Development to ensure a podium finish for the two teams. “The Federation has been working with the Ministry of Sports on this, since both the African Games and the Olympics are events mainly for the ministry. “So, we have been working closely to ensure we put up crack teams, two teams that will make the country proud. “The logistics of their participation are being handled by the ministry, but we are providing the team and we have been monitoring their preparations,’’ he said. Sanusi said the male team being handled by Paul Aigbogun and the female team being coached by Christopher Danjuma had been camping in Abuja since July to ensure a good outing. “Both teams will leverage on their recent respective experiences at the FIFA U-20 World Cup in Poland and the FIFA Women’s World Cup in France to conquer Africa in Morocco,’’ he said. The NFF general secretary then called on all Nigerians to support the teams and Team Nigeria as a whole so as to do well at the Games. NAN reports that Team Nigeria, comprising 462 athletes and officials, will depart Nigeria for Morocco in two batches from Thursday. Team Nigeria had finished second at the last edition of the Games in Congo Brazzaville in 2015.

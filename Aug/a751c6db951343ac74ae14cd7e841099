Secondus said: “You represent peace which the air around Adamawa has shown. “Your wish was to see your father live longer and see your achievements in office but God has called him to come to a place of peace. “There is a time for everything. Those in government should know that their tenure will come to an end one day. “You were elected on the basis of your performance while in office. This is a demonstration of the legacies you got from your father. “The steps taken so far, including appointments, show that you are a man of fate who lives by your words. “We pray that God’s wisdom will continue to direct you in your determination to render service to your people and our nation at large”. In his response, Governor Fintiri assured that he would leave no stone unturned in repositioning the state for greater productivity for the benefit of the people, in line with the manifesto of the PDP. He said: “PDP has come back as the dominant political party in the state,” adding that his administration is determined to carry out its responsibilities diligently

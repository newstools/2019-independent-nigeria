ADEWALE MOMOH AKURE – Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State has described the alleged rape of a 300-level student of Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba-Akoko (AAUA) by some soldiers as “mindless” and “callous.” Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The governor, in a statement issued by Donald Ojogo, the Commissioner for Information, on Saturday and made available to Sunday INDEPENDENT, called for the immediate prosecution of the soldiers who allegedly committed the crime. While commending Brig. Gen. Abubakar Zakari, the Brigade Commander of the 32 Artillery Brigade, for his swift reaction to the issue, the governor maintained that his administration would not condone  such criminal acts, particularly from those who should be upholding the law. The statement reads: “The governor of Ondo State, Arakunrin Oluwarotimi Odunayo Akeredolu, has urged the authorities of the Nigerian Army to immediately hand over to the Police for urgent prosecution, the soldiers arrested in connection with the alleged rape of a University student at the Akungba-Ikare military checkpoint. “Mr. Governor particularly finds the alleged offence callous, mindless and heart aching that it was said to have been committed by soldiers whose presence ought to be succour to the people, especially the vulnerable, in the face of the heightening wave of violence and insecurity in the country.” “It should be noted that the government of Ondo State under Arakunrin Akeredolu, shall do all within its powers to fight this bizarre menace of rape in the state. Rapists or those who wish to traverse this ignobly desecrating path will find Ondo State too hot as a refuge for such nefarious act. Government shall be firm and decisive,” the statement read. On Wednesday last week, a 300-level female student of AAUA was alleged to had been gang-raped by some soldiers stationed at a checkpoint in Ikare-Akoko, the headquarters of the Akoko North-East Local Government Area.

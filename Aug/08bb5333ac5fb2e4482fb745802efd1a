Prices of fresh tomatoes and pepper which had steadily been on the high side since early this year have eventually witnessed a decline in the week under review. Consumers seemed to be taken aback at the turn of events as prices of the produce for some time had not been favourable, fluctuating adversely to the inconvenience of consumers. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The presence of fresh tomatoes from Zaria, Jos, South-West and neighbouring countries such as Cameroun and Benin Republic has helped the situation such that traders had no option but to bring down the prices of the produce to encourage patronage. Despite the drop in the prices of the produce, many of the traders and consumers were of the opinion that the fall was not really significant especially when compared with what they were previously. During the week findings from a market survey across some states by the Business and Market Intelligence Unit of SUNDAY INDEPENDENT revealed that prices of the commodity fell by over 15 percent between July and August 1, 2019. Improved supply and low demand were predominantly mentioned as reasons responsible for the drop. Checks at the Dei-Dei Market, Abuja, showed that prices of fresh tomatoes and pepper were at a sliding trend. For example, prices of a big basket of fresh tomatoes which increased to between N14,500 and N15,000 last month fell within the region of N11,700 and N12,500 within the week. But this depends on the size of the basket and the bargaining power of the customer. Likewise, that of fresh pepper, declined marginally to N13,800 from N15,000 earlier sold. Mallam Nasir Abu, who trades in the produce at the Dei-Dei Market, Abuja, linked the situation to onset of its season of harvest as he opined that prices of the produce would soon crash further. For that of Achau Market, Kaduna, prices of a basket of fresh tomatoes which previously went for between N15,000 and N15,800 reduced to between N12,500 and N12,800 while that of a bag of fresh pepper dropped to N15,000 from N17,000 initially sold. A pepper seller named Iliyasu Jonah, at the Achau Market, Kaduna, in a chat with our correspondent ascribed the situation to improved supply. It is the same scenario at Ogbeogologo Market, Asaba, where prices of a basket of fresh tomatoes currently range from N18,000 to N18,500 down from N20,000 previously sold. Likewise, that of a bag of fresh pepper is currently selling for N15,000 as against N18,000, sold before. Mrs. Oluwakemi Ajagun, who retails the produce at the Ogbeogologo Market, Asaba, related the decline to low patronage coupled with increased availability. For Ose Market, Onitsha, the trend was not different particularly with prices of a basket of fresh tomatoes attracting between N17,500 and N18,000 as against N20,000 previously sold. That of a bag of fresh pepper also fell slightly to N14,500 from N15,500 earlier sold. At the Oba Market, Benin City, Edo State, prices of a basket of fresh tomatoes were at a downward trend, declining to N17,000 from N19,500 previously sold. Whereas that of a bag of fresh pepper sold initially for N16,000 fell to between N14,000 and N14,500, of which most of the traders attributed to a gradual arrival of its season of abundance. For that of Lafenwa Market, Ogun State; prices of a basket of fresh tomatoes fell within the region of N14,500 and N15,000 as against N18,000 previously went for while a bag of fresh pepper dropped to N14,500 from N16,000 earlier sold. Mr. Sola Edu, a trader at the Lafenwa Market Ogun State, connected the drop with increased supply usually associated with the season of harvest that is slowly approaching. But a lady who came to shop for food items at the Lafenwa Market, Ogun State, told our correspondent that the effect of the decline in the prices of the produce was not significant, stressing that it did not reflect on her purchases. Visit to Bodija Market, Ibadan, during the week indicated that prices of a basket of fresh tomatoes which previously went for between N18,000 and N19,000 declined, currently ranging from N13,500 to N14,500, depending on the size of the basket and the bargaining power of the customer. Likewise that of a bag of fresh peeper, currently selling for between N16,000 and N17,000, down from between N 19,000 and N19,500 previously sold. Mr. Busari Ahmed, who trades in the produce at the Bodija Market, Ibadan, said the reduction in the prices of the produce had not translated in to sales as consumers still patronised the alternative, tomato paste to augment the fresh one. He, however, said that with further increase in the supply of the produce, especially from other areas in the North that are yet to harvest the produce coupled with availability, prices of the produce would certainly decrease the more such that affordability would not be an issue. In Lagos, visits to popular Mile 12 markets indicated that prices of fresh tomatoes were at a declining trend particularly with the presence of different species from Nigeria and neighbouring countries. The increased number of trucks carrying the consignment was also a determinant factor influencing the price either positively or negatively. In spite of increased supply which seemed to affect prices of the produce positively, traders and consumers were still of the opinion that prices were still on the high side especially when compared with what they were previously. Mr. Gbenga Adediran, who sells the produce in bulk at the Mile 12 Market, Lagos, said that the drop was still not favourable as some of them were unable to sustain their normal purchases because of the huge amount of money involved. Despite the drop, prices of a basket of fresh tomatoes currently sells for between N14,000 and N15,000 as against N18,500 and N20,000 previous sold while that of fresh pepper previously sold for between N19,000 and N20,000 dropped to between N17,000 and N17,500.

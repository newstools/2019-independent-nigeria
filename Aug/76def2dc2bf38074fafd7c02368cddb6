UMUAHIA – A nongovernmental organization (NGO), International Society for Civil Liberties and Rule of Law (Intersociety), has condemned the killing of three policemen on national assignment led by ASP Felix Adolije, and a civilian in Taraba State as well as a motor cyclist, Chimaobi Nwaogu Uzoukwa, in Amaise, Umuokereke-Ngwa, near Aba, Abia State by soldiers last week. It, therefore, called on the Federal Government to heed the call by Amnesty International to institute a judicial inquiry to unravel the remote and immediate
causes of the attacks on policemen and the two civilians instead of instituting an Army Board of inquiry it did. In a statement it issued at the weekend and made available to Daily Independent in Umuahia, the organization lamented the killings of civilians and in some cases policemen by the military since 2015 and described as unacceptable. It, however, posited that the killing Nigerians allegedly started in August 2015 when Lt Gen Turkur Buratai was appointed the Chief of staff of the Nige
rian Army. The statement, which was signed by Obianuju Joy Igboeli, head of Civil Liberties and Rule of Law, Evangeline Chidinma Udegbunam, head of Campaign & Publicity Department and Emeka Umeagbalasi, board chairman of Intersociety, catalogued the killings of unarmed and defenseless Nigerians by Nigerian soldiers to include the alleged murder of dozens of unarmed and defenseless citizens of Igbo ethnic nationality in South East, Nigeria and the killing of more than 1000 Shiite followers
as well as the maiming of over 700 of them in Zaria, North Central, Nigeria. Said the group, “The recent premeditated killing of police officers in line of duty in Taraba State led by ASP Felix Adolije is also a way of reminding all Nigerians that this month, August 2019, makes it four years since the Lt Gen Buratai-led Nigerian Army launched its atrocious and murderous campaigns against the innocent, unarmed and defenseless Nigerian populations; leading to the massacre and maiming of thousands of Nigerians.

Tottenham Hotspurs are in talks to sell Victor Wanyama to Club Brugge before the Belgian transfer window shuts and hope to recoup the £11million they paid for the midfielder. Brugge want to sign 28-year-old Wanyama before the closure of their summer transfer window on September 2 and have money to spend after selling striker Wesley and midfielder Marvelous Nakamba to Aston Villa for a combined £33m. Nakamba’s sale has left Brugge needing to sign a new defensive midfielder and the club has already demonstrated their willingness to spend by signing goalkeeper Simon Mignolet from Liverpool this summer. Spurs signed Wanyama for a knockdown fee of £11m three years ago, as the Kenyan only had a year left on his Southampton contract. He still has two years left to run on his Tottenham contract and the club hopes to recoup the money they signed him for, even though Wanyama has slipped down manager Mauricio Pochettino’s pecking order and struggled with injuries. It is unclear yet whether or not Brugge would like to sign Wanyama permanently straight away or take him on loan with a commitment to buy as negotiations continue. Meanwhile, Spurs plan to refinance about £400m of their stadium debt through bonds issued via a private placement arranged by Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML). Tottenham originally took out a £400m five-year loan from BAML, Goldman Sachs and HSBC in 2017 to finance the construction of their new £1billion stadium. Last year, the club confirmed that the loan had increased to £637m as costs rose.

A bill to replicate the Federal Government’s anti-poverty Social Investment Programmes in Kwara State would be sent to the state House of Assembly in the coming days, Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq said on Monday. AbdulRazaq said this when he visited the Agricultural and Rural Management Training Institute (ARMTI) at Jimba-Oja, in Ifelodun Local Government Area of the state, adding that the legislation would domesticate the Federal Government’s TraderMoni and school feeding concepts in Kwara for the benefit of the poor in the state.

We have a goldmine in ARMTI and we will take full advantage of your resources,” he said. He added, “Empowerment must be from the communities and I can assure you that we’ll engage you because this week or so we are sending a Bill to the State House of Assembly to replicate the Federal Government’s social investment programme in Kwara.” He said the administration would also key into the Village Alive Development Initiatives (VADI) of AMRTI to empower Kwara youths and deepen participation in agriculture. Executive Director of ARMTI, Olufemi Ajayi, lauded AbdulRazaq for his commitment to development. Ajayi said VADI had been packaged to provide local farmers with micro credits to boost farming in rural communities. Speaking later at the National Centre for Agricultural Mechanisation, AbdulRazaq said his administration might revive the Patigi Rice Mill and also encourage the setting up of pando yam processing firms in the Baruten axis of the northern senatorial district as part of efforts to spread development.

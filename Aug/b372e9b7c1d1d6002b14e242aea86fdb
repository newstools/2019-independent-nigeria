The U.S continues to dispatch military and logistics equipment to the
terrorist YPG/PKK-occupied area the east of Euphrates River in Syria. An Anadolu Agency footage recorded late Friday the fresh U.S. delivery
through the Semelka border gate at the Iraq-Syria border. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network After passing through the northeast of Syria, the convoy proceeded to
internal areas as 70 trucks were carrying armored military vehicles,
prefabricated buildings and construction equipment. There were also a large number of fuel tankers and trucks with covered
haulages in the convoy. On July 26, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said: “Tens of
thousands of truckloads of weapons and ammunition have been given to
the PKK/YPG. Who gives [them]? Those who appears to be our strategic
ally gives [them].” He also pointed out that the YPG and the PKK are the same terrorist
organization, despite the U.S. efforts to separate them. The YPG is the Syrian offshoot of terror group PKK, which has been
responsible for the deaths of nearly 40,000 people in Turkey,
including many children, women, and infants, for more than 30 years. – Turkey, US agreement on Syrian safe zone During his meetings with U.S. counterparts, Turkey’s National Defense
Minister Hulusi Akar demanded the establishment of a safe zone the
east of the Euphrates and the removal of the YPG/PKK elements. On Wednesday, Turkish and U.S. military officials agreed that the safe
zone in northern Syria will be a “peace corridor” for displaced
Syrians longing to return home. Also, both sides agreed on the immediate implementation of measures to
address Turkey’s security concern. They also agreed to establish a Joint Operations Center in Turkey to
coordinate and manage the establishment of the safe zone. The U.S. Embassy in Ankara also confirmed in a statement that the
parties agreed to rapidly implement “initial measures” to address
Turkey’s security concerns and establish a Joint Operations Center.

A major border crossing between Nigeria and Benin Republic was closed on Wednesday, leaving several people and vehicles stranded on both sides. Seme Border, supposedly the busiest land crossing in Nigeria, was shut on Tuesday after some truckloads of prohibited tramadol and codeine were intercepted in Lagos on August 16. The closure continued on Wednesday morning, with Nigerians streaming towards their country’s border from Benin Republic hoping they would be allowed into their country. Benin Republic traders, who had entered Nigeria to supply goods in Lagos, were also stranded and prevented from returning to their country. Victims of the abrupt shutdown of West Africa’s main commerce corridor were seen fuming about their ordeal on social media Wednesday.

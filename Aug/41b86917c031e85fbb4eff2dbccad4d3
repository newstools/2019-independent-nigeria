Lewis Hamilton has said he won’t be allowing Netflix to use any footage of him from the German Grand Prix due to the fact he was ‘sick the whole time’. Fans of the popular show ‘Drive to Survive’ won’t see any footage of the five-time world champion’s eventful weekend at Hockenheim when the show returns for a second series. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network “I won’t be in the Netflix show much, because I was sick the whole time,” he was quoted on GP fans. “I won’t allow them to release that.” The timing of Hamilton’s decision is unfortunate for the show’s producers as it was the first time Mercedes had granted them access, having opted against appearing at all in the first series. With the German Grand Prix coinciding with the German manufacturer celebrating its 125th anniversary and 200th race, it seemed to be the ideal weekend for the cameras to focus on the team. However, in a cruel twist of fate, Mercedes were to endure one of their worst races of the season. Hamilton, who was suffering from a sore throat, managed to take pole position but crashed during the race losing part of his front wing. He also received a five-second time penalty for incorrectly entering the pit lane and eventually finished a lowly 11th place before being bumped up to 9th after penalties for both Alfa Romeo drivers. Teammate Valteri Bottas was unable to capitalise either, failing to finish entirely after crashing out. The race was eventually won by Red Bull’s Max Verstappen although Hamilton still holds a 41-point lead over Bottas in the overall standings. Mercedes will be hoping for better luck at the Hungarian Grand Prix this weekend, although they will be away from the glare of the Netflix cameras. Team boss Toto Wolff insisted the producers would still be happy with the footage that would be signed off. “We have given the Netflix guys more content than on any other weekend.” he said.

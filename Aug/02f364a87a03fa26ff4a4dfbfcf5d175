ABUJA – As Muslims worldwide are observing this year’s Eid el Kabir Sallah celebrations, Dr. Boboye Oyeyemi, the Corps Marshal of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), has sent his warm felicitations to the Muslim faithful in Nigeria on the occasion, enjoining all motorists to drive with utmost care to ensure a hitch-free celebration. In the same spirit, Oyeyemi said every road user must show patience, obedience and sacrifice while sharing the road with others to create a hitch-free road environment for the celebrations. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network He stated this in his Eid-el-Kabir Sallah message in which he assured members of the public particularly, the Muslims that FRSC has made adequate preparations for effective traffic management during the festive period, but appealed for cooperation from all road users to make the strategies put in place towards achieving the plans successful. In a release signed by the FRSC spokesperson, Corps Commander Bisi Kazeem, the Corps Marshal expressed satisfaction with the arrangement already put in place to ensure effective traffic management along all the identified black spots and major corridors and highways across the country. He however observed that without commensurate support and understanding from the road users, the efforts could be in vain. He, therefore, appealed for patience, obedience and show of love and consideration for other road users while driving in line with the spirit of the Sallah celebration.

The Principal Partner, Paris Trust Limited, Mr. Timothy Bagwams, at the weekend stated that the firm, responsible for the collection of unremitted statutory allocation to the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), is trailing some oil and gas companies operating in the region, for the failure of the affected companies to pay their dues to the commission. Bagwams also told our correspondent in Warri that the firm has been authorised by the NDDC to serve letters to the defaulting companies to remit their dues to the commission.

Oil prices fell yesterday over fresh concerns of weaker crude demand after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would impose tariffs on more Chinese imports, potentially ramping up a trade war between the world’s two largest economies. Tensions in the Middle East offered some support to prices, with Iran seizing a tanker that it said was smuggling fuel. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Brent crude was down 50 cents, or 0.8 per cent at $61.39 a barrel, while U.S. crude was down 24 cents, or 0.4 per cent, at $55.42 a barrel. Both of the benchmarks fell last week, with Brent dropping more than 2 per cent and U.S. crude ending the week around 1 per cent lower. “Oil demand has disappointed in 2019 due to weaker economic activities, unfavourable weather and trade tensions,” Goldman Sachs said in a research report. It would be recalled that Trump last week said he would impose a 10 per cent tariff on $300 billion of Chinese imports and said he could raise duties further if China’s president, Xi Jinping, failed to move more quickly towards a trade deal. The announcement extends U.S. tariffs to nearly all imported Chinese products. China on Friday vowed to fight back against Trump’s decision, a move that ended a month-long trade truce. The trade war has been hitting economic growth, which tends to reduce demand for commodities such as oil. U.S. crude oil exports surged by 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) in June to a monthly record of 3.16 million bpd, suggesting there is plenty of oil in the market. South Korea bought record volumes and China resumed purchases, data from the U.S. Census Bureau showed.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has met with President Emmanuel Macron in Paris before attending the weekend G7 summit, where he will face world leaders for the first time since making changes to the status of Kashmir that have raised tensions with Pakistan. Macron invited the Hindu nationalist premier for an official visit to Paris to discuss the two countries’ extensive cooperation in areas of defence, nuclear energy, maritime affairs and counterterrorism. The French president has also invited India to attend the weekend’s G7 summit in Biarritz, along with leaders of Australia, Chile and South Africa, as four “major partners committed to the protection and promotion of democratic freedoms”. India’s Ministry of External Affairs said Modi would speak to G7 leaders about the environment, climate, oceans and digital economy.

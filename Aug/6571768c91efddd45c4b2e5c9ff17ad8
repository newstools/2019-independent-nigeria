Speaking with journalists in Ado Ekiti, the Command’s Public Relations Officer, DSP Caleb Ikechukwu, said the suspect after raping the woman also strangled her to death. “Medical examination confirmed the above but we have not been able to ascertain who actually committed the crime and what actually led to that. “Apart from this, we saw condom and semen within the scene where the crime was committed, which also substantiated the fact she was actually raped. “We were told that a man, who was a neighbour actually did it and fled. We are yet to arrest the man but proper security arrangements have been made that would ensure his speedy arrest of the suspect”.

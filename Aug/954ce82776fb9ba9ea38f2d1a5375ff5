North Korea is intensifying its criticism of South Korea as joint
U.S.-South Korea military drills enter their second week, with
Pyongyang accusing the South of acting like a “shy dog barking more
wildly”, according to Washingtontimes.com reports. The North’s state media used that and other rhetoric Sunday to express
frustration over the drills, describing them as an “aggressive war
exercise” and asserting that inter-Korean dialogue will remain
suspended until South Korea offers a “plausible excuse” for the
exercises. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network According to South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency, a statement by North
Korea’s foreign ministry also used at least one obscenity in reference
to the annual drills, which U.S. and South Korean officials have
renamed this year in an apparent attempt to ease Pyongyang’s fears
that the drills are a rehearsal for invasion. Stars and Stripes reported that the drills began on Aug. 5 and were
being kept low-key to avoid provoking North Korea, which previously
threatened it could derail the Trump administration’s efforts to
resume stalled nuclear talks with the regime of North Korean leader
Kim Jong-un. The command-post training — as military officials are calling it to
avoid using the word “exercise” — will last until Aug. 20 and will
mainly involve computer-simulated scenarios as opposed to past years
when those were combined with combat field training, according to
officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity with Stars and Stripes. The U.S. has roughly 30,000 military personnel stationed in South Korea.

Anthony Taylor has been tasked with handling Liverpool’s big clash with Arsenal this weekend. The Mancunian referee has not taken charge of a fixture between the two since he oversaw Arsenal’s 4-1 win over Liverpool in April 2015. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network On that day, Taylor sent off Liverpool’s Emre Can in the 84th minute for a second bookable offence. Taylor refreed three Liverpool fixtures during last season: home wins over West Ham and Bournemouth but also the loss at Manchester City. He took charge of Arsenal on seven occasions during the last campaign and the Gunners failed to lose any of those matches; although it did include both draws against Brighton and a derby day 1-1 with Tottenham. Taylor will be assisted by Gary Beswick and Adam Nunn. The fourth official is Jon Moss, with Stuart Attwell looking after the VAR. Elsewhere in the Premier League refereeing appointments, Graham Scott has not been given a fixture to referee following his disastrous weekend in game week two. Scott got stuck in traffic and was unable to fulfill his appointment of Chelsea vs Leicester on Sunday, meaning fourth official Oliver Langford took charge of his first-ever Premier League game. It was also Scott who was the VAR official for Manchester City’s controversial draw with Tottenham. Although the decision to rule out Gabriel Jesus’ stoppage time winner was correct, he failed to spot Rodri being pulled down by Erik Lamela at a corner earlier in the game – a decision which many former referees believe should have been given. Scott will instead of two appointments as fourth official: Aston Villa vs Everton and Tottenham vs Newcastle.

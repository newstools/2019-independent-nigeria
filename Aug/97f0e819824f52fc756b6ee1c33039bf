However, compared with June oil product demand fell 0.5%. Analysts said demand declined month on month as transport fuel demand began to ease following May’s general election, and as demand fell for diesel used to run pump sets for irrigation purposes ahead of the peak rainy season in July. Diesel demand in July fell 8.3% month on month while gasoline demand fell 4.4%. Demand for LPG rose 9% year on year as the government’s focus on providing clean cooking fuel to poor households resumed after the elections were over. LPG demand surged 23.5% in July from the previous month as new cooking gas connections released after the elections picked up. Demand for jet fuel in July fell 0.7% year on year but rose 1.2% month on month to 674,000 mt. In the first seven months of the year diesel demand rose 2.8%, gasoline demand jumped 9.8% and LPG demand rose 5.8%. Overall demand for oil products in the first seven months of the year rose 1.8% year on year, mainly on higher demand for transportation fuels during the general election period.

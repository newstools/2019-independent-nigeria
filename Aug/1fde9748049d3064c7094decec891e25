Tool’s new album (Fear Inoculum) finally comes out later this month after a 13-year wait, but here we are with less than four weeks to go until its August 30th release date and we haven’t even heard a song! To say Tool is keeping things very close to the chest on this one would be an understatement. The band has been revealing details about Fear Inoculum bit by bit, and just now they shared the album cover artwork on Instagram. No artist is credited, but it certainly has longtime Tool collaborator Alex Grey’s fingerprints all over it. It also features the new band logo Tool unveiled last month.

A tool made their music available online for the first time ever last Friday. Since then it’s posted some impressive numbers as fans catch up on listening.

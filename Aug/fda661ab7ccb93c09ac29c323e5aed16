Football could experience another “Eric Cantona moment” if government action is not taken to stop the racial abuse of players, says former Tottenham striker Garth Crooks. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba and striker Marcus Rashford have been abused on social media after missing penalties in the past week. United forward Cantona infamously launched into a kung-fu-style kick on a Crystal Palace fan in the crowd after claiming he was abused during a game at Selhurst Park in January 1995. “If something drastic is not done soon we might be reliving an Eric Cantona moment and, if we do, the game will only have itself to blame,” said Crooks, a trustee of anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out. “I never thought I’d be talking about footballers receiving racial abuse in this day and age, and certainly not on the industrial scale we are talking about at the moment. “Racial abuse on social media is out of control and abuse in football grounds is not far behind.”

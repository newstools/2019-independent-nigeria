Abuja – The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) under-remitted the sum of N77.92 billion to the Federation Account from Domestic Crude Allocation in 2017, the latest report released by the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) has revealed. The report entitled, ‘Pilot Study on Commodity Trading for 2017’, which was made available to journalists by Dr. Orji Ogbonnaya Orji, NEITI’s Director, Communications and Advocacy, also indicates that NNPC deducted N297 billion from earnings from the Domestic Crude Allocation as costs and losses. The costs are broken down as N141.6 billion for under-recovery on petroleum products; N25 billion for crude and product losses; N130.4 billion for pipeline repairs and maintenance. Waziri Adio, the Executive Secretary of NEITI, stated that the special report was undertaken in furtherance of the recent decision of the global Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) to add commodity trading transparency to its scope of coverage through stand-alone and in-depth reports. The objective, Adio stressed, was to ensure adequate returns to governments, increasing competition and efficiency in commodity trading, and ensuring greater public scrutiny of the resultant revenues. The NEITI Executive Secretary further stated: “Resource-rich countries receive shares of minerals produced in their territories as equity shares or as in-kind payments, and these minerals are usually sold directly or indirectly to commodity traders through state-owned enterprises. “However, the process and details of these sales are mostly shrouded in secrecy, even when more than half of the revenues from the extractive sector come from these sales. “This is why the EITI resolved to beam more search-light on commodity trading. Nigeria is one of the five EITI-implementing countries selected to pilot this enhanced focus.” From the report, the total crude oil production for 2017 was 692 million barrels. Out of this volume, the share that went to the federation was 240.9 million barrels, representing 35% of the total crude oil production for the year 2017. A trend analysis for the year under review, according to the report, shows that the 2017 federation share was 4% higher than the 231.6 million barrels in the same category for 2016 but was 19% lower than the 297.8 million barrels for 2015. This shows that while there was a slight improvement on the figure for 2016 (a year characterised by vandalism and sabotage of oil facilities), crude production for 2017 was about a fifth less than the 2015 level. “A further breakdown of key findings in the report show that 240.9 million barrels federation share for 2017 was disaggregated as follows: Domestic Crude Allocation (DCA): 105. 9 million barrels or 44% of federation share; FIRS liftings: 57.3 million barrels or 24% of federation share; Federation Export: 50. 2 million barrels or 21% of federation share; Third Party Financing: 17.6 million or 7% of federation share; DPR liftings: 9.9 million barrels or 4% of federation share.”

Lagos/Agency Report – UN World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) in its International Tourism Highlights 2019 report four out of five tourists visit a destination in their own region, just as 58% of all international tourists arrive at destinations by air.
The report added that the share of air travel has increased from 46% in 2000 to 58% in 2018 while the share of leisure travel has grown from 50% in 2000 to 56% in 2018.
Leisure travel is the main purpose of visit in all world regions except the Middle East, where visiting friends and relatives (VFR), for health or religious purposes dominate.
The share of world population requiring a traditional visa declined from 75% in 1980 to 53% in 2018.
However, the report said Asia, the Pacific and Africa led growth in arrivals with a 7% increase in 2018, just as Asia, the Pacific and Europe enjoyed above-average growth in tourism earnings.
UNWTO disclosed that France continues to lead among the world’s top 10 destinations in international tourist arrivals and receipts.
It added that the United States remained the largest tourism earner in 2018, while Japan entered the top 10 earners ranking following seven years of double-digit growth in international tourism receipts.
The top 10 tourism earners account for almost half of total tourism receipts, while the top 10 destinations in arrivals receive 40% of worldwide arrivals.
China remained the world’s largest spender, with USD277 billion spending on international tourism in 2018 or one-fifth of international tourism expenditure, followed by the US.

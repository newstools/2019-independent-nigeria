ADO-EKITI – As the annual cultural festival Idiroko holds today, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has alleged a plot by some politicians to cause mayhem in the state. A statement by its Director of Media and Publicity, Elder Sam Oluwalana, made available to journalists in Ado-Ekiti alleged that part of their plot is to hide under the celebration of the annual festival to cause crisis. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network It was gathered that former Governor Ayo Fayose who had been out of the state for months is billed to grace the occasion. The development, some public observers feared, could heighten tension since the incumbent Governor Kayode Fayemi could also be at the event. But Fayose in his immediate reaction said the present government was only looking for excuse to avoid the event. The former governor, who spoke through his media aide, Lere Olayinka, said, “We are not in the habit of dignifying low life and people living with guilt of forcing themselves on Ekiti. “It is obvious that more than two years after manipulating themselves to power, they are still afraid of the shadow of Ayo Fayose, a man whose footprints will remain on the sands of Ekiti forever. Rather than jumping up and down, spinning lies against Fayose, who is moving on with his life after serving Ekiti diligently, Governor Fayemi and his APC election riggers should concentrate on making meaningful impact in the state, because almost one year has been wasted already out the four years that was stolen for them. Also, Fayemi should endeavor to give the Udiroko Festival the same level of glamour and attention it was given by the Fayose-led.

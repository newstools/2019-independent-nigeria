LAGOS – A Lagos office of online bookmaker Bet9ja suspected of infringing the copyright of Lotto9ja Limited owned by rival bookmaker, Western Lotto Nigeria Limited was yesterday raided by Sheriffs of the Federal High Court. The raid was followed by an Anton Piller injunction granted by Justice Taiwo Taiwo of a Federal High Court in Abuja on August 8, 2019, in favour of Western Lotto. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network An Anton Piller order authorises an applicant to search premises and seize evidence without prior warning. The sheriffs and Western Lotto officials, protected by policemen, executed the order at a Bet9ja premises at 9, Funsho Williams Avenue, Surulere, Lagos. The judge ruled in a suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/925/2019, following an ex parte application by Western Lotto through its counsel, Mr John Baiyeshea SAN for Chief Oluwole Olanipekun SAN. The first and second applicants in the suit are: Western Lotto Nig. Ltd and Lotto9ja Ltd, while the first to third respondents are: Registrar of Trademarks, K.C. Gaming Networks Ltd (Owners of Bet9ja) and K.C. Lottery Company Ltd. The applicants informed the judge that Western Lotto launched a new company in July known as “Lotto9ja” after registering with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) and the office of Trademark at the Federal Ministry of Trade and Investment. It averred that in the course of preparing for the launch, it discovered that K.C. Gaming Networks Ltd was also planning to use the same name that it registered with the CAC. It further averred that through its lawyers, it warned K .C. Gaming Networks to desist, but the company allegedly continued to brand its POS terminals, T-shirts and other souvenir with the Lotto9ja trademark. The applicants sought an Anton Piller order and prayed the court to, among others, restrain the defendants. Ruling on the application, Justice Taiwo held: “An order of Anton Piller Injunction, is hereby made directing the 2nd and 3rd Defendants, to forthwith permit the Sherriff to enter and search the 2nd and 3rd Defendants’ premises located at 9, Funsho Williams Avenue, by Fire Service Station, Ojuelegba Bus Stop, Lagos.

LAGOS – As Nigeria joins the rest of the world to celebrate this year’s Eidel Kabir, Nigerian Tulip International Colleges Foundation (NTICF) has slaughtered 90 cows and distributed to Nigerians to enable them to celebrate Sallah. Ercan Yilmaz, the Principal, Nigerian Tulip International College, Ogun campus, who spoke with newsmen on Sunday on behalf of the NTIC top management, said that the celebration would not complete if there are people around who for some reasons could not partake of the celebration because of financial constraints. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network “Our celebration is not complete if there are people around us who, for some needs could not partake of the celebration, hence the need for those who are privileged in the society to always reach out to the needy and the less privileged. “Just as in the previous years, the top management of our school is reaching out to people of different faiths to share in the joy of the occasion,” he said. Yilmaz also said that year in, year out, the foundation had always embarked upon a charity programme to enable such people to be part of the festivity of the Sallah period, stressing that just as it is been done in Sallah, so also  it was being done for Christmas and Ramadan. He said that during this Eid-el-Kabir, owing to paucity of funds, the number of cows was lower, stating that approximately 90 cows were slaughtered for this charity programme in Ogun. “A similar number or more shall be slaughtered for sharing in other zones across the country,” he said. Those that would benefit, he explained, were orphanages, prison yards, staff of government establishments, mosques, churches and disabled people’s homes. Some of the beneficiaries who spoke with DAILY INDEPENDENT expressed their heartfelt gratitude to the foundation, stating that Nigerian leaders should emulate the gesture and always help the needy in the society. They also called on all Nigerians to use the celebration to pray for the peace in the country.

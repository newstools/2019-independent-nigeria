 Emmerdale spoilers have revealed that Moira will use her husband Cain (Jeff Hordley) to wind Nate up as she arranges a date in front of him. As she gets ready for the date night, Nate walks in and the pair share another passionate moment until they are interrupted by Cain again. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network However, the next day, the pair finally take things to the next level as they rip in the hay. But as the soap revealed spoiler pictures, shocked fans took to a fan forum to comment on the pictures, which show Nate with his hand around her neck as they kiss. One fan posted: “Who the hell grabs a woman by the throat when they kiss them?!” Another added: “A power-mad control freak, that’s who, which is what so many writers still purport to believe is what we women want. “Just as they constantly write the women as half-heartedly protesting, often for many weeks or months, before finally succumbing to the caveman’s “charms”, thus also perpetuating the myth that No doesn’t necessarily mean No, she’s just playing hard to get.” A third chipped in: “Vile story line that no one wants to watch pity they didn’t scrap the idea when they realised it was a huge turnoff.” A fourth wrote on social media: “There is something so creepy about Nate…” As fans have been speculating that Nate is only sleeping with Moira to get revenge on Cain because of a yet-to-be-revealed vendetta, could there be something more sinister going on? And is Moira going to be okay? Emmerdale continues tonight at 7pm on ITV.

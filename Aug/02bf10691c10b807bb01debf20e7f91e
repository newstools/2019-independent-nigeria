Hundreds of firefighters battled wildfires in Greece Tuesday, with the
largest burning through a thickly forested nature reserve on the
island of Evia north of Athens where three villages have been
evacuated, according to Beta.theglobeandmail.com reports. More than 220 firefighters were deployed to tackle the fire that was
burning out of control in Evia, along with six water-dropping planes
and seven helicopters. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Smoke from the fire blanketed the Greek capital in the morning. The
country’s civil protection authority warned people in affected areas,
particularly the elderly, young children and those suffering from
breathing or heart conditions, to remain indoors and set air
conditioning units to recycle indoor air. Dozens more firefighters, two planes and a helicopter tackled a
separate forest fire on the northern island of Thassos. A third
wildfire was burning through brush and dried weeds near Thebes,
northwest of Athens, while another broke out in southern Greece,
burning woodland and agricultural areas. More than 30 firefighters
were tackling the fourth blaze. Forest fires are common in Greece during the hot, dry summer months.
Authorities have repeatedly warned the public not to engage in outdoor
activities that could cause fires, such as welding work, burning dried
weeds or lighting campfires and barbecues. Parks and forest areas are
sometimes closed to the public at times of high fire risk. Last year, more than 100 people died when a fast-moving forest fire
broke out in a seaside area northeast of Athens and raged through a
nearby settlement of mainly holiday homes. The fire trapped people in their cars as they attempted to flee, while
many other victims drowned as they tried to swim away from beaches
overcome by heat and choking smoke.

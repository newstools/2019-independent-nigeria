Contrary to the expectation that prices of staple food items such as rice and beans would soar during the Sallah celebrations, they maintained a steady trend, a situation which many traders attributed to lack of money. Prior  to the Sallah celebrations, prices of  imported  rice which increased steeply in the month of June, declined marginally in July  and fell further in the week under review as visits to some markets  indicated. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Likewise, prices of beans and garri which had been on steady decline were not affected by the Sallah celebrations. But prices of fresh tomatoes and pepper which had been on steady rise before the Sallah celebrations skyrocketed further, especially fresh pepper during the event due to high patronage and scarcity arising from seasonal factors. Findings from a market survey across some states by the Business and Market Intelligence Unit of SUNDAY INDEPENDENT revealed that prices of staple food in some of the markets visited remained unchanged from what was sold between July and August 15, 2019 while that of fresh pepper fell marginally by over 10 percent from what was sold between Saturday and Thursday, August 15, 2019. Reasons for the stability in the prices of staple food items, particularly beans and garri were attributed mainly to availability due to increased supply from major sources but that of rice was due to low demand despite the Sallah celebrations. Patronage level for imported rice during the Sallah improved a little according to traders, but those who procured the commodity in bags were few owing to lack of money. Checks at the Wuse Market, Abuja, revealed that prices of a 50kg bag of imported rice which previously attracted between N16,000  and N17,500 depending on the quality and brand  had not changed. Similarly, that of a bag of brown beans was not affected by the Sallah celebrations either, still selling for between N25,000 and N26,500. That of a 60kg of the white garri also had not changed from between N7,000 and N8,000. The same could be said for that of Achau Market,Kaduna,  especially with the prices of a 50kg bag of imported rice still going for between N14,500 andN15,000. That of a 100kg bag of beans of the same market reduced slightly to N24,500 from N25,000 it initially attracted. Prices of a 50kg bag of white garri was, however, still on the high side, selling for between N10,500 and N11,500 from N10,000 previously sold. The Sallah celebrations had a negative effect on prices of fresh tomatoes due to high demand. For example prices of a basket of fresh tomatoes that were previously ranging from N8,000 to N10,000  at the Achau Market, Kaduna, soared to between N12,500 and N13,000. That of a bag of fresh pepper witnessed an upward trend of over 10 percent, selling within the region of N15,000 and N16,500  against  N13,200 previously sold. Mallam Yaqub Idrisu, a fresh tomatoes and pepper seller at the Achau market, blamed the hike on the produce’s inadequate supply as most of the suppliers had to travel to their country home for the celebrations. In Ogbeogologo Market, Asaba, prices of staple food such as rice and beans were not influenced adversely by the Sallah celebrations, particularly with  the prices of a 50kg bag of imported rice declining to between N17,500 and N18,000 from between N18,500 and N19,000 earlier attracted. That of a bag of white garri did not change at between N4,000 and N4,500  of which many of the traders linked to availability. At the Ose Market, Onitsha, the situation was not different. For instance, a 50kg bag of imported rice sold for between N16,500 and N17,500 remained steady, likewise a 100kg bag of  brown beans, still going for N32,000 as at August 15, 2019. For that of Oba Market, Benin City, prices of a 50kg bag of imported rice remained unchanged at between N16,000  and N17,500 but this depends on the brand and the bargaining power of the buyer. Also, prices of a 100kg bag of brown beans that reduced to between N32,000 and N33,000 had not changed since early this year. But prices of fresh tomatoes and pepper which had been on the high side especially during the Sallah celebrations fell marginally. For example, prices of a basket of fresh tomatoes which went for as high as between N17,000 and N18,000 dropped slightly to N16,000  as well as fresh pepper declining to N18,000 from N19,500 sold during the Sallah celebrations, as at August 15,2019. At the Lafenwa Market, Ogun State, the price trend for staple food did not vary from that of other locations. For example, prices of a 50kg bag of imported rice remained stable at between N13,000 and N14,500 while that of brown beans also maintained a steady trend at between N30,000 and N32,000. For Bodija Market, Ibadan, prices of a 50kg bag of imported rice remained unchanged at between N13,500 and N15,000. Likewise brown beans, still selling for between N28,500 and N30,000. But, that of fresh pepper and tomatoes, still high despite the marginal reduction from what was sold during the Sallah celebrations. Many of the traders at the Bodija Market connected stability in staple food to increased supply and lack of purchasing power. In Lagos, visits to popular Mile 12 and Iddo markets showed that prices of staple food items were still in sliding trend. For example, prices of imported rice remained unaffected at between N13,000 and N13,500. Likewise, that of a 100kg bag of beans remained stable at between N30,00 and N32,000. Prices of the white and yellow garri still currently go for between N4,500 and N5,000, a situation which many of the traders connected to increased production. Prices of fresh tomatoes and pepper which skyrocketed further during the Sallah celebrations had started reducing gradually. For instance, a bag of fresh pepper that went for as high as between N22,000 and N25,000 declined slightly, currently ranging from N19,500 to N21,000. Mr. Ganiu Oyewale, who trades in the produce at the Mile 12, Market, Lagos, said prices of the produce would drop sharply when farmers/suppliers resume fully to business from the Sallah break. He, however, linked the hike during the Sallah celebrations to scarcity and increased demand from consumers.

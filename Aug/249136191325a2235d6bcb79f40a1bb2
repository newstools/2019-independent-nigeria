Former President Barack Obama tried to talk Joe Biden out of jumping into the race for the Democratic presidential nomination — and fears his veep could “damage his legacy” with his White House bid, according to a report. “You don’t have to do this, Joe, you really don’t,” the former president told Biden before the front-runner entered the race, insiders told the New York Times. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Biden has repeatedly cited his relationship with his old boss as he touts his credentials on the campaign trail — but Obama has asked Biden staffers to make sure the gaffe-prone veep does not “damage his legacy” or “embarrass himself” during his run. They have been unable to prevent him from making verbal blunders, like his claim last week that “poor kids are just as bright … as white kids” and his insistence that there are “at least three” genders. The former president has told insiders of his worries that Biden’s top aides are “too old and out of touch with the current political climate.” Obama has not endorsed any of the two dozen Democrats vying for the nomination.

A university don has cautioned that as much as Africa needs investments from the West and China, the strategic interests of Africa and its people must not be toyed with. Dr. Chijioke Uwasomba of the Department of English Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), IleIfe, said this at a two-day workshop of The Maroon Square Discourse on National Development at the Federal College of Education (Technical) Yaba, sponsored by Rosa Luxemburg Foundation. Uwasomba, speaking on the theme: “The Chinese Are Here: Any Prospect for Growth and Development,” said that “This rivalry in no way benefits Africans but satisfies the strategic interests of the West and the Chinese and their lackeys in Africa. “Both the West and the Chinese view Africa as a vast reserve of natural resources and, increasingly a “camp” for cheap labour. It is the material interests of these “powers” that propel them into Africa, causing plunder, conflicts, and other forms of humiliating exploitation against Africans”. On what the Chinese are offering, he said: “The question is very important taking into consideration the irrefutable fact that every nation no matter its level of philanthropism, first and foremost, operates to satisfy the interests of its citizens. “The Chinese cannot be different and it must be stated that they are in Africa to pursue the realisation of the interests of their citizens.

CALABAR – Professor Ivara Esu, the deputy governor of Cross River State, said the state had trained hundreds of health workers to ensure the success of newly-introduced Men-A Vaccine, which has come into routine immunisation in the state. Speaking at the weekend in Calabar during the flag-off ceremony/introduction of MenA Vaccine into routine immunisation in Cross River, Esu said since Cross River is among the 25 states that fall within the belt, the government would do everything possible to ensure that every eligible child is immunised .

The deputy governor enjoined all women to take their children within 15 months to the nearest government health facility for the exercise and expressed appreciation to all the partners including World Health Organization WHO, United Nation’s Children Education Fund UNICEF and the NPHCDA. The Executive Director of National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), Faisal Shuaib, in a brief he personally signed and made available to newsmen, disclosed that 26.7 million Nigerian children between 1 and 7 years were at risk of contracting meningitis and that the vaccines were the only way to prevent it. He further disclosed that Nigeria has 25 states and the FCT that fall within the meningitis belt.

He was quoted as saying; “One time I have seen a shooting star and I wished for a baby brother, and I wished for like two sisters for my little sister because she always wanted a little sister, I knew this day was always going to come,” The triplets weighed about 4 pounds and each and were delivered just 4 minutes apart. She gave birth to a boy and 2 girls and named them Blaze, Gypsy, and Nikki. Quoting her experience while giving birth to the triplets she said; “It was quiet, we thought they were done. He’s over there, kind of like rocking like, thinking of the names and then she’s like well we need another blanket and his reaction is like excuse me, put it back, no, I was told I have twins, I’m not doing triplets. She’s like no, there are three babies in here, and there are triplets,” She continued; “You don’t ever see triplets being conceived naturally, let alone going 34 weeks without knowing. So, everyone’s like I can’t believe it, I’m like we’re still in shock, trust me, we know what you mean like I go to the doctor’s thinking I’ll have surgery for kidney stones and end up going into labor with a c-section that night. It’s crazy,”

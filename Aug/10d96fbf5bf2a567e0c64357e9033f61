LAGOS – The Academic Forum of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN) has debunked rumour that the leader of the group, Sheikh Ibrahim El-Zakzaky was expelled from Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The forum in a statement made available to journalists at the weekend, said the rumour is being peddled by those it referred to as liars, insisting that its investigation revealed that El-Zakzaky was not expelled from the institution, rather he made a first class degree from the same university. South-West chairman, Academic Forum of IMN, Mikail Yunus, had stated that there was need to set the record straight, since the matter had become a major discussion in Nigeria particularly amongst social media users. He said “After God Almighty saved the Sheikh from Indian killer doctors, they have resorted to marketing another lie and unsalable blackmail that Sheikh El-Zakzaky was expelled from Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, in October 1979. “To put the record straight, Sheikh Zakzaky wrote his final examinations in ABU on 7th July, 1979, when sessions used to close in the University in September. During the A.B.U crisis in June of the same year, some Students including Shaikh Zakzaky missed some of their examinations. They were later invited by the University to write the missed papers in November. “There is no iota of truth to claim that the Sheikh was expelled in October, about four months after his final examinations and graduation. If he was expelled, why did the university invite him to write a rescheduled examination in November? The Vice Chancellor then, Prof. Ango Abdullahhi is still alive and still calls Sheikh El-Zakzaky his student,” he added.

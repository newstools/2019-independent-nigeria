Romelu Lukaku will complete his acrimonious exit from Old Trafford after Manchester United agreed terms with Inter Milan for their AWOL striker. It’s understood Inter have had a third bid of £72million, including £12m in bonuses, accepted after day of negotiations with Lukaku’s agent Federico Pastorello in London. The 26-year-old Belgium striker is expected to fly to Italy and undergo a medical on Thursday. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network It follows Lukaku’s attempts to force a move this week by training for two days with his old club Anderlecht in Belgium without United’s permission. The player ignored the Premier League club’s demands to return and has been fined two weeks’ wages – approximately £400,000 – for his transgression. Lukaku did not turn up at Anderlecht’s Neerpede complex, where he has been training with the club’s Under-18 squad, for a third day and the player’s black Bentley could not be seen at his house nearby. Although United and Inter had until the Italian transfer window closes on September 2 to reach agreement, there was a general acceptance that the deal needed to be completed as soon as possible after Lukaku’s relationship with United broke down. The 26-year-old player was unhappy over United’s refusal to accept offers of £54m and £68m from Inter, while a proposed swap deal with Juventus for Paulo Dybala collapsed last week.

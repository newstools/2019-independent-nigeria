The growth of world merchandise trade volumes is likely to remain weak in the third quarter of 2019, according to the World Trade Organisation’s (WTO) latest ‘Goods Trade Barometer.’ The Trade barometer report, also suggested that below-trend expansion in merchandise trade would persist in the coming months. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network According to the report, the latest reading of 95.7 from the barometer was lower than the previous release and signalled that stronger trade growth was not yet in sight. The latest reading continued to fall well below the baseline value of 100 for the index of the renamed barometer, which features a design revamp ahead of the launch of a new Services Trade Barometer in September, the report added. It stated that the loss of momentum in goods trade had already been confirmed in previous quarters where official data were available. “Sustained weakness in the barometer index was driven by below trend values in all component indices. The international air freight (91.4) and electronic components (90.7) indices showed the strongest deviations from trend, with readings well below previous releases. Indices for export orders (97.5), automobile production and sales (93.5) and agricultural raw materials (97.1) all remained below trend although they show some signs of having bottomed out. “Only the index for container shipping (99.0) was close to the baseline value of 100,” it added. It would be recalled that the Director-General’s mid-year report last month underlined that trade flows hit by new restrictions continued to be at historically high levels between mid-October 2018 and mid-May 2019. Tensions leading to higher trade barriers and greater uncertainty pose significant downside risks to trade growth forecasts.

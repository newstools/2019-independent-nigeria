Nacho Monreal is on the verge of leaving Arsenal to complete a return to Spain, according to reports. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The defender has spent the past six-and-a-half seasons at the Emirates Stadium after joining from Malaga, but now appears to be in line for a move back to his native country. According to Mundo Deportivo, who cite Onda Vasca, Real Sociedad are hopeful of arriving at an agreement for Monreal by the end of the day, with the Spaniard expected to be pushed down the pecking order under Unai Emery once Sead Kolasinac and Kieran Tierney become available again. Tierney was a deadline day signing from Celtic after being one of Arsenal’s main targets all summer, but is yet to feature due to injury, while Kolasinac missed the season opener against Newcastle, along with Mesut Ozil, due to security concerns – but he has since featured as a substitute against Burnley. Monreal’s contract is entering its final year, and although Arsenal have the option to extend it by a further 12 months, they seem to be considering cashing in on the 22-time Spain international, who has made 250 appearances for the club. Real Sociedad are searching for a new left-back after last season’s first choice, Theo Hernandez, returned to Real Madrid after his loan spell before being sold on to AC Milan. Monreal, who had seven years of La Liga experience before joining Arsenal (five with Osasuna, and two with Malaga), would fit the profile they are looking for.

Inter Milan have registered their interest in Alexis Sanchez with Manchester United, sources have told ESPN FC. The Serie A side, who have already signed Romelu Lukaku from Old Trafford this summer, are hoping to negotiate a loan deal for the Chile international before the Italian transfer deadline on Aug. 23. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Sanchez is open to talking to Inter if the two clubs can agree a deal, with the forward having fallen down the pecking order at United under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Inter are hoping to reach an agreement that would see United pay a portion of Sanchez’s wages this season before buying him next summer, but sources have told ESPN FC that an agreement has not yet been reached. Solskjaer said on Friday that Sanchez, 30, is nearing full fitness after returning to training following a hamstring injury, and the Norwegian also suggested that the former Arsenal man could play a key role for United this season. But according to ESPN FC’s sources, the manager is open to letting Sanchez leave despite already seeing his attacking options reduced by Lukaku’s departure. Sanchez still has three years left on the deal that he signed after arriving from Arsenal in January 2018. He has made 45 appearances for United, but has scored just three Premier League goals and has not completed 90 minutes in a United shirt since August 2018.

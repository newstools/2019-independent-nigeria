Sen. Rochas Okorocha, immediate past governor of Imo State, has urged the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Adamu to disregard the petition written against him by the state governor, Emeka Ihedioha. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network He said that the Nigerian Police Force, being a reputable organisation, should not allow itself to be distracted by “such deceitful petition”, which according to him, lacked merit. Okorocha, who made the call in a statement signed by his Special Assistant on Media, Sam Onwuemeodo, said Ihedioha decided to petition the police, just because he (Okorocha) addressed his supporters in the state when he travelled to the area. The senator denied Ihedioha’s allegation that while addressing his supporters, he incited them to cause trouble in the state. Okorocha’s statement read in parts: “Gov. Emeka Ihedioha has sent a petition to the Inspector General of Police, Mr Mohammed Adamu to call Sen. Rochas Okorocha to order because he is inciting his supporters to cause trouble. “He said in the petition that I stole N1 trillion from the state and that the police should investigate my activities. We want to appeal to the IGP to disregard the letter because it is an afterthought that has no traceable fact.” News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Okorocha addressed his supporters on Tuesday, when he arrived Imo for the first time since he was issued his Certificate of Return to the Senate after the 2019 Presidential and National Assembly elections.

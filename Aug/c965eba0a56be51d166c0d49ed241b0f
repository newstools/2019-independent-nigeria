Juventus forward, Cristiano Ronaldo, has said that he was too comfortable at Real Madrid, warranting his move away from the club where he could seek further challenger. In a recent interview, the Portuguese forward said it was not so much of a challenge anymore at Real Madrid after spending nine years and winning so many times and individual honours. “I don’t like being in the comfort zone. At Real Madrid I was too comfortable, I had already won so much that each new title was just one more, and the routine always the same.” Ronaldo reflected on how he spent his prime years in Spain and how difficult it was for him to leave the Spanish side: “Obviously leaving Real Madrid was difficult because I spent nne years, 60 percent of my career was there, so you feel it. “But I came to a different challenge and I’m very happy to be here (Juventus). I wanted a new challenge.” The player switched Madrid for Turin in a €100m deal last summer. Noting how he had played against the side numerous times throughout his career, he stated that he always had an admiration for Juve. “The Juventus project has enticed me. I played against them many times in the quarterfinals or semifinals. It was always a team that I liked, that always struggled.” Whilst Madrid struggled in his absence, the player has returned to the city since. Most recently to collect the MARCA legend award, which he was awarded by Florentino Perez as the pair embraced.

ABA – Nigerian Christian Hospital, Nlagu, Abia State, has lamented the dilapidated state of Aba-Ikot Ekpene, which it said, has immensely affected the fortunes of the hospital negatively. The missionary hospital established in 1965 and located along the highway is now a shadow of itself as it is only patronised by patients under critical condition. Chief Medical Director of the hospital, Dr. Jombo Israel, told Daily Independent that “indeed the economy of the hospital is critically down. “Patients can no longer access the hospital because even the alternative rural roads to it are gone because the heavy duty trucks in their efforts to circumvent the dilapidated highway ply them,” Israel said. According to the CMD, patients patronising the hospital currently are those whose conditions are critical and they see the hospital as a last resort. “The situation is horrible. A patient under critical condition can die in the process of conveying him or her to the hospital because the process is very rigorous,” he said. While appealing to the Federal Government to effect quick intervention on the road through some palliative measures, the CMD said that the hospital is now depending on foreign material donations for survival. He thanked some philanthropists, who through their magnanimity, bailed some indigent patients from the hospital. “Our major area of concern is indigent patients. No patient has attended the hospital without receiving medical treatment. We will first and foremost treat you before demanding bills. “It unfortunate that the hospital, which was a haven for all manner of patients, is now a shadow of itself.”

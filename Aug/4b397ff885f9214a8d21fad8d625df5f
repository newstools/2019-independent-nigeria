LAGOS – Prof. Oluwatoyin Ogundipe, Vice-Chancellor, University of Lagos (UNILAG) has called for improvement and collaborative efforts in combating the dying reading culture in Nigeria. The VC who lamented on the poor reading culture in today’s society identified information traffic as part of factors militating against quality reading habits. Speaking recently at a public presentation of short story books authored by pupils of UNILAG Staff School, Ogundipe said, “Information traffic is on the high side. That is why so many students don’t want to sit down to read, but there is a need for us to improve on that culture and to let our students know that somebody that reads will be able to develop his or herself. “There are so many distractions along with the teaching and learning value chain in Nigeria, hence the need for a collaborative effort to improve the writing and reading culture among children of school age in Nigeria.” Speaking on the presentation of the books authored by pupils between nine and 11 years old, Ogundipe said, “This is a very good development where we are celebrating our children and that will show you the quality of the school and the product of the school. We are saying that we will need to do more to improve on what they have now. On her part, Juliet Ajayi, Headmistress of UNILAG Staff School, said access to smartphones, especially social media is a major challenge to the writing and reading culture.

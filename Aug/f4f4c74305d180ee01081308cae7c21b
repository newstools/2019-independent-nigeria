Femi Falana, human rights lawyer, on Thursday, prayed the Federal High Court, Abuja, to give him a date for hearing in his applica­tion regarding Omoyele Sowore, the convener of #RevolutionNow protests, who is in detention. Sowore, who is pres­ently in detention, had, on August 9, approached the Federal High Court, Abuja, seeking an order to vacate the ex parte order that gave the Department of State Service (DSS) the legal backing to detain him for 45 days. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Justice Taiwo Taiwo, in a ruling on August 8 in an ex-parte ap­plication, ordered Sowore’s detention for the said peri­od to enable the DSS carry out and conclude its inves­tigation on allegations lev­ied against him. The DSS had also, on Tuesday, challenged the court order, allowing it to detain Sowore for 45 days against its request of 90 days pending investiga­tion.

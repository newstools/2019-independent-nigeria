LAGOS – Against the backdrop of calls to lure John Mikel Obi and Odion Ighalo from retirement, former Super Eagles’ captain and coach, Augustine Eguavoen, has advised against such calls, asking for the players’ decisions to be respected. Although he admitted that the players would be missed in the Super Eagles, considering their experience, Eguavoen stressed that they should not be forced to act against what they believe was the best decision for their future. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Speaking in a radio sports programme monitored in Lagos on Thursday, Eguavoen expressed shock with Ighalo’s decision but said Mikel’s step was understandable. “The retirement of Mikel is a little understandable considering how has been in the team for a longer while, but that of Ighalo is a surprise to me, regardless of the reasons behind it. “Whatever the case, we cannot force anyone to play against his wish, since they have decided they want to stop, we should just respect their decisions and find the right replacements for them,” he said. “Ighalo is the one who knows why he took the decision that many people believe was taken in spontaneous reaction to pressure and abuse from fans,” he added. Eguavoen, however, submitted that the two players should be allowed to decide on their own, especially as they were now in their 30s, and are already thinking of life after football. It would be recalled that both players called it quit with the Super Eagles after the team clinched the third place position at the end of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Egypt, making it the eighth time that Nigeria has won the third place match in the history of the competition.

AWKA – The Civil Liberties Organization, (CLO) Anambra State chapter, has asked the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) to tender unreserved apology to former deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, over last Saturday’s attack in Germany. It said that the incident was a practical demonstration of the old saying that, “Igbo don’t have kings” which Igbo must strive to jettison. The chairman of the body, Comrade Vincent Ezekwueme, stated this in a statement in Onitsha. Ezekwueme described the attack as disgraceful to the Igbo nation. Part of the statement read: “The attitude of the perpetrators is most despicable, condemnable, barbaric, inhuman and horrendous. “Ekweremadu is supposed to be applauded, commended and reciprocated considering his sacrifices towards protecting and projecting Igbo interest.” He counselled the Igbo in Diaspora to learn how to be civil, dynamic, diplomatic and tactful. According to him, any disagreement with their leaders should be amicably resolved with respect rather than by violence. He added: “If they have any disagreement with their political leaders, it must be resolved amicably with respect, corrections, not condemnation or violence. “Like Chief Odimegwu Ojukwu would say, “Violence is the worst form of irresponsibility,” he added. Ezekwueme, nevertheless, enjoined Ekweremadu to lead by example by extending love and forgiveness to his attackers.

The FIFA Council has agreed to expand the number of teams taking part in the FIFA Women’s World Cup from 24 to 32, with effect from the next edition in 2023. Since the bidding process for the FIFA Women’s World Cup 2023 is already underway − with the nine bidders initially expected to submit their bid books by 4 October 2019 – the FIFA Council exceptionally made this decision remotely, and not at one of its meetings, the next of which is scheduled for 23-24 October in Shanghai. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Having been presented with a background document on the expansion, FIFA’s decision-making body voted in favour of adopting the 32-team format and, as a consequence, updating the hosting requirements and the timeline of the bidding process for 2023. The key milestones of this updated timeline are that circular to be sent out with a short time window for bidding member associations to reconfirm their interest in bidding by month end. The council also opened bidding to any member associations to express their interest, setting December 2019 as deadline for bid submissions. According to the council, publication of bid evaluation report will be in April 2020, while naming of host(s) will be in the following month. “The astounding success of this year’s FIFA Women’s World Cup in France made it very clear that this is the time to keep the momentum going and take concrete steps to foster the growth of women’s football. I am glad to see this proposal – the first of several − becoming a reality,” said FIFA President Gianni Infantino. “The expansion reaches far beyond the eight additional participating teams; it means that, from now on, dozens more member associations will organise their women’s football programme knowing they have a realistic chance of qualifying. The FIFA Women’s World Cup is the most powerful trigger for the professionalisation of the women’s game, but it comes but once every four years and is only the top of a much greater pyramid.

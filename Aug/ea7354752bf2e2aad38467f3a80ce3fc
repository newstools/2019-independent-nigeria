Imo State Deputy Governor, Engr. Gerald Irona has reiterated the readiness of the administration of Chief Emeka Ihedioha, the Executive Governor of Imo state to partner with critical stakeholders in making life more meaningful for people of the State. The Deputy Governor made the pledge while receiving a delegation of Association of Petroleum Marketers and Dealers in Owerri, weekend. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network “The present administration in Imo State, led by Governor Emeka Ihedioha is committed to partnering with your organisation and all other stakeholders in the state in delivering good governance to the people of Imo State. “I received your letter, dated July 19 on indiscriminate litigations instituted against your members in revenue courts, among other issues. We shall take steps to ensure timely and amicable resolution of all the issues.” He assured the delegation of an enabling environment for business in the state. Earlier in his speech, Chidiebere Okoroafor, Chairman of the Association, appealed to the State Government to address what he described as “indiscriminate litigations instituted against our members in revenue courts in the state.” He further appealed with the government to take steps to ensure the harmonisation of levies payable by their members, even as he assured of the readiness of members of the Association to pay harmonized levies. The group also used the occasion to appeal for an out-of court settlement of cases instituted against some of their members by the last administration in the state, promising to support the present administration’s developmental strides. A joint meeting of relevant government officials, agencies, officials of the association and the Deputy Governor to resolve all the issues would hold at a later date.

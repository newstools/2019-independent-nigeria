ABUJA – As a result of incessant flooding in the nation’s capital leading to the loss of lives and properties, 150 buildings have so far been demolished in the flood-prone areas, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Permanent Secretary, Chinyeaka Ohaa, has said. Ohaa said that more buildings in Abuja will be demolished to open up channels that had constricted the waterways to ease flow of water. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network He made this known on Wednesday at a stakeholders’ forum on Flood Mitigation and Response Coordination, which held in De Horison Hotel, Abuja. According to him, “The FCT Administration will continue to remove structures constructed in violation of relevant laws and further complicate our flood risk. So far, 150 of such structures have been removed in furtherance of the on-going exercise to clear obstructions to waterways in line with the Abuja city plan”. Ohaa, however, regretted that despite repeated sensitisation and awareness programmes, many residents still dump wastes in drainages and other prohibited locations, which result in blockage of waterways.

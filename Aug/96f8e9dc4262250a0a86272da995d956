LAGOS – The National Insurance Commission (NAICOM) has stated that the ongoing recapitalisation of insurance companies will further strengthen the capacities of the companies; enhance the industry’s contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and by extension adds value to the overall economy. Mr. Sunday Thomas, Deputy Commissioner (Technical), made the submission at seminar organised by the Commission for journalists in Ijebu Ode, Ogun State at the weekend.

According to him, the exercise would not achieve its desired objectives without the cooperation of all stakeholders, adding that insurance sector needs to be part of the big game in the transformation process of the government. “Recapitalisation of companies is one of the processes for insurance industry to be part of that agenda. The whole idea is for the industry to be strong in claims settlement and be liquid to do big ticket transactions.” He added. “We have the mandate to ensure that this recapitalisation throws up strong insurance companies that will withstand the global test of time.’ In a view to achieving strong and viable companies capable of adding value to the economy, Thomas said that the Commission’s doors are open to interested investors from far and wide. Also speaking at the event, Mr Thompson Barineka, Director Inspectorate at the NAICOM, added that the intention of the exercise is to make funds available for companies to have enough to meet their obligations. According to him, under the current exercise, companies with negative outlook are exposed to various recapitalisation options that are available for them to raise funds.

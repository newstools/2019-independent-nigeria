The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) has said that its Air Task Force (ATF) of ‘Operation Lafiya Dole’ has neutralised scores of Boko Haram terrorists (BHTs), destroying their hideout at Bula Korege on the fringes of the Sambisa Forest in Borno. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, NAF’s Director of Public Relations and Information, who disclosed through a statement at the weekend, said the operation was conducted on Friday. It further said the air strikes conducted by the air task force was part of an ongoing mission code-named ‘Operation Green Sweep lll’, targeted at identified terrorists’ positions in Borno State. NAF explained that the target was designated for attack based on credible intelligence reports, which were further corroborated by series of Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions. The Air Force added that intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance weres able to establish the fact that the settlement was a major hub of Boko Haram terror activities. “The ATF, therefore, detailed two Alpha Jets to attack the target area. The air strikes were synchronised for maximum effect, recording devastating hits on the Boko Haram hideout, killing several of their fighters in the process, as captured in the Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) footage,” Daramola said. He said the Air Force would sustain its operation against the terrorists in the North-East if it worked in concert with surface forces.

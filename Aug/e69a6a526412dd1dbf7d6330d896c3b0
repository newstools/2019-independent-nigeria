Lagos – Paul Aigbogun, Flying Eagles’ coach, has named a new captain for the squad even as he lined up fresh striker to lead his attack at the upcoming Africa Games in Morocco. Due to the absence of Ikouwem Udoh Utin, Aigbogun has named Ibrahim Abubakar as his new skipper, while Emeka Chinonso looks good to step out as the squad’s latest top striker. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network “Abubakar  will captain the Flying Eagles in Morocco with another returning player, Wasiu Alalade from Enyimba of Aba to serve as vice-captain, with both Nigerian Professional Football League (NPFL) stars getting chances of proving their mettle once again under Aigbogun’s charge,” said our source. Chinonso showed a sign of what he can do with a long range sizzler during training, but he will have to do more in order to edge ahead of Poland 2019 revelation, Success Makanjuola, who has also impressed in training at the under-20 team’s Abuja camp. However, a strong hint has emerged that Makanjuola may get a deep role in midfield, to fill in for other missing players from the squad that lost 2-1 to Senegal to crash out of the Youth Mundial, with Aigbogun set to build his new formations round the fringes of what he saw in Poland.

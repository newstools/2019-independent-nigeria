Charlie Daniels, Bournemouth defender is set to undergo knee surgery and will miss the remainder of the 2019-20 campaign, the Premier League club said on Thursday. Full back Daniels was stretchered off in a 3-1 defeat to Manchester City on Sunday after falling awkwardly when attempting to deliver a cross in the first half and scans have confirmed a dislocated right patella.

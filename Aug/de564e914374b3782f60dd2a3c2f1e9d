UMUAHIA – Senator Chris Adighije, who represented Abia Central in the fifth Senate, has expressed worry over the deteriorating state of insecurity in the country and asked the Federal Government to be proactive in tackling the challenge. The former senator who spoke in Umuahia also lauded President Muhammadu Buhari for picking the right people for the right portfolios. He explained that any reasonable Nigerian would be worried over the insecurity in the country, especially in the Southeast and pointed out that the killing of Rev. Father Offu and Father Rapuruchukwu was a sad and unfortunate and shouldn’t be allowed to happen again. The former senator described the choice of Dr Uchechukwu Ogah from Abia State as minister as a good one, pointing out that his accomplishment as businessman would make him offer his services meritoriously. The former senator also believed that Ogah as APC flag bearer in the 2019 governorship election in Abia State, would serve APC party faithful with dedication and that as minister of State (Steel), he would he would revitalized the steel industry in Nigeria. On the election petition filed by Moa Ohuabunwa against Senator Orji Uzor Kalu of Abia North senatorial district, Adighije asked Ohuabunwa to withdraw his petition since he (Orji) has been elected the chief whip of the Senate. “He should go for an out of court settlement and save themselves from constant litigations. The chief whip is the only principal position the Southeast is holding in the National Assembly and it would be unfair and unjust to loss the position “If I have my way would have advised for out of court settlement they should find a common ground even though the matter is at the point of judgment and I am of the opinion that the statues quo should remain for the interest of the Southeast.”

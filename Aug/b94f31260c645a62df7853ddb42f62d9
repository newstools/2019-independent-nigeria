Prince Akin Olayisade, former chairman, Ekiti State Universal Basic Education Board(SUBEB), has commended President Muhammadu Buhari for the appointment of Otunba Adeniyi as minister, saying it will boost industrial development in the state. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Adebayo, pioneer governor of Ekiti State, was on Wednesday sworn in and to head the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment. Olayisade, former chairman, Public Works Corporation and Special Adviser to the Governor on Project Monitoring, who described the portfolio as strategic, stressed that the former governor would leverage on the office to commence an aggressive industrialisation of the 23-year-old state. In his congratulatory message, Olayisade urged Adebayo to deploy his new position to work with Governor Kayode Fayemi to attract viable industries to the state. He described Adebayo as a resourceful manager of men and resources, who would bring his political and business acumen to bear for the upliftment of the country’s industrial and trade development policies and programmes. He said Adebayo had continually enjoyed the confidence of the people that he would deliver as he (the minister) was able to leave indelible marks in Ekiti State through landmark projects between 1999 and 2003 when he was the governor, despite acute shortage of fund. Olayisade stated that the ministry had been very pivotal to the development of Ekiti State, saying that dearth of viable industries had been the greatest impediment militating against the development of the state’s economy.

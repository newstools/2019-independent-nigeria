Pakistan has suspended a bus linking Lahore to India’s capital in
reaction to New Delhi’s revocation of the autonomy of the disputed
Kashmir region, according to Presstv.com reports. Arshad Ali, tourism officer at Pakistan Tourism Development
Corporation that runs the Pakistan leg of the journey, said on
Saturday that the government had issued directives that meant the bus,
which was the last remaining public transport link between the two
countries, was suspended from Saturday onwards. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network “The operation will remain suspended till further decision,” he said. Delhi Transport Corporation, that runs the service in the other
direction, did not respond to requests for comment. The Lahore-Delhi friendship bus service was first launched in February
1999 and it has run almost continuously as a symbolic link between the
two countries since then. The government of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi revoked the
special status of Indian-controlled Kashmir on Monday, in a move
described by Pakistan as “illegal.” A curfew was also imposed in the
Muslim-majority region and thousands of additional paramilitary troops
were deployed. Pakistan has already cut two rail links. It has also downgraded
diplomatic relations and suspended bilateral trade with India, all
part of what it called a diplomatic effort to protest against the
Indian decision. Pakistan has also said it would partially close its airspace to Indian
flights until September 5. Kashmir has been split between India and Pakistan since their
partition in 1947. Both countries claim all of Kashmir and have fought
three wars over the territory. India regularly accuses Pakistan of arming and training militants and
allowing them across the frontier. Pakistan strongly rejects the
accusation. Indo-Pakistani relations nosedived in February when over 40 Indian
paramilitaries were killed in a bomb attack in Kashmir. New Delhi
blamed Pakistan-based militants. Islamabad denied any involvement.

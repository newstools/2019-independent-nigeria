The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) oil output hit an eight-year low in July as a further voluntary cut by top exporter Saudi Arabia deepened losses caused by U.S. sanctions on Iran and outages elsewhere in the group, a Reuters survey found. The 14-member Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries pumped 29.42 million barrels per day (bpd) this month, the survey showed, down 280,000 bpd from June’s revised figure and the lowest OPEC total since 2011. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The survey suggests Saudi Arabia is sticking to its plan of voluntarily restraining output by more than called for by an OPEC-led supply deal to support the market. OPEC renewed the supply pact this month, shrugging off pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to pump more. Despite lower OPEC supplies, crude oil (LCOc1) has fallen from a 2019 high above $75 a barrel in April to $65 yesterday, weighed down by concern about slowing economic growth. “Bulging global oil stocks have failed to decline and the market remains well supplied,” said Stephen Brennock of oil broker PVM, despite the OPEC-led cuts. OPEC, Russia and other non-members, known as OPEC+, agreed in December to reduce supply by 1.2 million bpd from Jan. 1 this year. OPEC’s share of the cut is 800,000 bpd, to be delivered by 11 members and exempting Iran, Libya and Venezuela. In July, the 11 OPEC members bound by the agreement, which now runs until March 2020, achieved 163% of pledged cuts, the survey found. All three exempt producers also pumped less oil.

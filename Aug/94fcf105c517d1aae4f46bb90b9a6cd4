Adebiyi said that palliative repair works had already been carried out on the available lanes for traffic on both carriageways. His words “traffic diversion signages (image and lights) had been created as required within the construction zones but at no time would there be less than two lanes in each direction. Traffic diversions are not permanent but temporary measures needed to ensure the timely completion of the project”.

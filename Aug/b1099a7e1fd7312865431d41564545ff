LAGOS – The Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) has in­augurated an implementa­tion monitoring committee to monitor ship registry in Nigeria. This was coming barely two weeks after a commit­tee led by Emmanuel Ilori, saddled with improving Ni­geria’s ship registry, submit­ted its final report. Director General of NI­MASA, Dr. Dakuku Peter­side, had earlier assured that the agency would in­stitute an implementation committee to monitor the implementation of the re­port. Speaking at the ceremo­ny, Peterside described ship registry as the face of a na­tion’s maritime industry and indicative of the coun­try’s status as a maritime nation. Represented by the Exec­utive Director, Maritime La­bour and Cabotage Services, Gambo Ahmed, the NIMA­SA boss said: “The fact is that the Ship Registry along with the Maritime Safety Department are charged with the onerous responsi­bility of keeping unseawor­thy ships away from the flag. It was with the foregoing in mind that the primary com­mittee was established in February 2018 and its report submitted a couple of weeks back has made far-reaching recommendations which the Director General has promised to implement as best as we can.” “I have the honour of in­augurating the Implementa­tion Monitoring Committee of the Ship Registry Re­forms with Emmanuel Ilori as the Chairman,” Gambo said. The Terms of Reference of the Implementation Mon­itoring Committee include: review the recommenda­tions of the committee and extract immediately, action­able items on short, medium and long term basis for exec­utive management consider­ation and approval. The committee would also undertake any other task re­lating to the implementation of the committee’s report as may be directed by the exec­utive management.

According to the Record, the recent move of Nicholas Pepe to Arsenal from Lille could see the French side upping their efforts to try and sign Jozo Simunovic from our club. The Gunners seem rather intent on causing us issues at the moment. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Not only has the Kieran Tierney saga been a headline act in the window, indirectly they could now put us in trouble in terms of trying to keep Jozo Simunovic. The Pepe deal was expensive and Lille now have the money to try and get the defender, so it remains to be seen if we have to hang on to him with all our might. All I would say, is that the French side is now flush and so if they do come calling we should only ask for an extortionate amount to try and put them off. Whether or not that works, though, remains to be seen.

Lionel Messi is in a race against time to be fit for Barcelona’s La Liga opener against Athletic Bilbao on Friday. Messi trained alone on Wednesday, working with fitness coach Juanjo Brau as he continues his recovery from a calf injury. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network He picked up the injury in his first session of preseason last Monday and as a result missed Barca’s tour of the United States last week. There’s a chance that Messi will return to full training on Thursday but the odds are against him featuring from the start at San Mames. The Argentina forward has not played in any of Barca’s five friendlies and hasn’t been involved in a competitive game since the Copa America. Ernesto Valverde said last weekend that it would be “very difficult” for Messi to be ready for the Athletic game. Messi, who turned 32 this summer, was managing a groin injury throughout the second half of last season and the coach is loath to take any risks with his star player.

JOS – Governor Simon Lalong  of Plateau State and Chairman Northern Governors Forum has warned that unless the sons and daughters of Northern region step in to assist in finding solutions to the region’s challenges, it will take a longer time to achieve results. Lalong gave this advice while delivering a keynote address at the 2019 annual convention of the Zumunta Association, an umbrella body of Nigerians from 19 Northern States, in Minnesota, United States of America.

He said a situation where youths  in the North constituted about 60 percent of the region’s population with about 40 percent of them unemployed, did not augur well for region’s security and development as most of them were easy targets for criminals who take advantage of them for crimes and social instability. Lalong said: “Since most of them are unemployed, such talents and energy are either wasted or being channeled into negative and unproductive engagements with significant unpalatable consequences for the country. “This is more pronounced in the North where security crises occasioned by Boko Haram terrorists, kidnappings, cattle rustling, banditry and herdsmen/farmers clashes have come to dominate our lives.” The Northern Governor’s Forum, he said, had resolved to synergise and pursue policies and strategies that will tackle the challenges of insecurity faced by the region and promote peaceful coexistence. He assured that the Buhari-led APC government and the various administrations in the North had put in place various programmes such as N-POWER, AGSMEIS, GEEP, among others to engage the youths through entrepreneurial activities and job opportunities.

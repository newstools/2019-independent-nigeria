ADEWALE MOMOH AKURE – Rufus Giwa Polytechnic, Owo (RUGIPO), a chapter of the Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Polytechnic (SSANIP), has condemned the sack of workers at the Polytechnic’s Staff Primary and Secondary Schools by the institution’s governing council. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Addressing journalists, on Thursday, Comrade Chris Olowolade, the Chairman of the association described the mode of sack of the affected workers by the governing council as unacceptable. The SSANIP chairman described the decision as unpopular for the Governing Council to decide to privatise the staff school when the school is performing optimally in both academics and extracurricular activities. Olowolade described the action of the Polytechnic’s authorities as unfair, stressing that affected workers were treated like lepers. The association, however, hailed the state governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu for his timely intervention over the development. “It is unfair for the management and the Governing Council to treat worker of the Polytechnic staff school like lepers at a crucial period of their careers. The decision is unpopular more so that the school is performing optimally in all activities. The staffs in question are 100% qualified and bonafide staffers of the Polytechnic who should not under any guise be treated otherwise by the management. “This claim is verifiable in various ways which include the nature or mode of their employment, regularisation and confirmation of their appointment. They all met the criteria and procedures used for their promotion,” the labour leader opined.

Liverpool have been handed a timely boost ahead of this weekend’s Premier League clash against Arsenal with the return to training of Dejan Lovren. The only two teams with a 100 percent record at the start of the new season meet at Anfield in the late kick-off on Saturday, meaning something has to give. Trips to Anfield haven’t been great for the Gunners of late; they’ve not tasted victory since 2012 and have conceded at least three goals on their last four visits. And there’s good news on the fitness front for the hosts ahead of the game. The Croatia international has been absent from the Liverpool squad for the last two games because of illness as confirmed by manager Jurgen Klopp last week. “Why isn’t he here? It’s because he is ill,” the Reds boss said ahead of the UEFA Super Cup penalty shoot-out win over Chelsea. But it would appear that Lovren is over his illness and could be in contention to face the Gunners. He took part in a training session at Melwood on Tuesday as he looks to prove his fitness to Klopp. Despite returning to training, it remains to be seen if Lovren is included in the Liverpool match-day squad on Saturday. Joe Gomez and Joel Matip are currently battling it out for the right to partner Virgil van Dijk at centre-back, so it’s likely that the one who misses out will take a seat on the bench.

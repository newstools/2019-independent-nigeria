ABUJA – The World Bank Group said on Thursday that its net commitment to Nigeria over the years is about 11 billion dollars. The Country Director, Rachid Benmessaoud, made this known in Abuja at the maiden edition of the Nigeria Portfolio Performance Award. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Organised in partnership with the Ministry of Finance, the award was to recognise and honour outstanding performances from project implementation units of World Bank-supported projects at states and federal levels. According to him, the bank’s commitment is geared toward projects targeted at alleviating poverty and improving the lives of the people. He said that 60 per cent of the bank’s programmes were implemented at the state level and another 40 per cent by the Federal Government. Benmessaoud said that the bank’s portfolio in Nigeria was among the largest in the entire African region, adding that it had more than 30 operational projects. He said that the projects cut across health, education, agriculture, social protection, energy, infrastructure, governance, among others, in the 36 states of Nigeria, including the Federal Capital Territory. He also said that the bank was working towards a new country partnership framework that would outline the new reform challenges that the government faces and how it could support it in implementing solutions to the challenges. “The country partnership strategy is always anchored on the economic reform plan of the government and in this case, we have used the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP), which is the medium term programme of the government on which we are anchoring our country partnership framework. “We have plans to scale up our commitment but you know the scale-up is not only about funding.”

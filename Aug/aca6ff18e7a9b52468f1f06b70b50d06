Edoka, who is also the Kogi State Chairman of Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) gave the sweeping blame Friday in Lokoja at the 14th Edition of North Central Zonal Conference of the Union. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The Vice President decried the attitude of the political office holders who decided to circumvent the directives of the Governor Alhaji Yahaya Bello to pay three months salaries in full from the bailout refund but wondered that officials at Local Government ministry decided to pay 85% to the workers. He called on the government to beam their searlight at the officials to ascertain reasons for flouting the directives saying the workers are waiting in earnest for the refund of the balances. He added that although the workers were happy with the government for the payment of five months salary areas said the government is yet to fulfil all the aspects of the agreement entered with labour before the release of the #30.8bn bailout found by the Central Bank of Nigeria ( CBN).

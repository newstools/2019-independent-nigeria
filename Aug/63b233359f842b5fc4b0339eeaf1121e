He declared that the programmes are also aimed at transforming the college in line with the vision of the current administration for the institution, stressing that with this; the college would be able to compete favourably with its counterparts across the world. He told journalists that the programme, which commenced five years, had contributed immensely to the knowledge base of the Nigerian aviation industry. For OND, he explained that the college is running courses on Electrical/Electronics Engineering Technology, Aircraft Maintenance Engineering Technology, while for HND, admissions are available for Aviation Management, Aircraft Maintenance Engineering Technology (Avionics option), Aircraft Maintenance Engineering Technology (Airframe/ Power Plant Option). Besides, he stated that the college is also offering PGD in Aviation Management (full time), which would be held in Zaria, Kaduna State, while the part-time of the programme would hold in Lagos. He explained that admission into the programme would close after six weeks period, commencing from Monday last wek. He said: “We are introducing the OND, HND and PDG programmes to interested candidates, especially those already in aviation in order to increase their knowledge and exposure. Just as you are aware, education is the bedrock of any society. “All the courses will take place in Zaria, except the PDG, which has both full time and part time. We decided to bring the part time programme to Lagos in order to attract aviation professionals more. We discovered that most of them are working and their tight schedules may not permit them to run such a programme in Zaria. So, we brought it closer to them in Lagos.”

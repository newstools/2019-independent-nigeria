Alphonso Davies was the name on most Bavarian lips as his side went down on penalties to Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday in the Audi Cup Final, an invitational tournament hosted on a bi-annual basis by the German giants. The game probably wouldn’t have gone to the shoot-out only for Davies’ contribution. The 18-year-old Canadian looking mature beyond his years, set-up German teenager Fiete Arp to halve the two goal lead Spurs had established, in the 61st minute.

In post-match comments reported on Bayern’s official website, coach Niko Kovacs expressed happiness with the performance from the young players he started against last season’s Champions League finalists. “They did well and that must give them a boost,” said the 47-year-old.

Sven Ulrich, one of two ‘keepers Bayern used in the game, singled out the young Canadian for praise. ”All the young players were outstanding. Respect and hats off to them. Bayern can be proud to have lads like that.” He went on to say of Davies, that he has “ … taken a big step in the right direction [in the last six months] and has great potential to improve.” More famed goalkeeping counterpart, Manuel Neuer also chipped in making special mention of the Canadian’s agility on the pitch and the ability he possesses, but warned he must keep working on his game. FC Bayern are now looking forward to the weekend when they face runners-up Borussia Dortmund in the final of the DFL Supercup that provides the opportunity to lift a first title of the new season. Kovac added: “It will be an interesting game and we want to win it.”

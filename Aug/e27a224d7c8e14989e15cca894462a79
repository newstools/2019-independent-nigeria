UGHELLI = THE Association of Secondary Schools Classroom Teachers, (ASSCT) in Ughelli North Local Government Area of Delta state has thrown its support for the Nigeria Union of Teacher of the state, following the alleged deduction of N500 from teachers’ salaries by Academic Staff Union of Secondary School (ASUSS).
In a statement signed by the chairman, Comr. Ojarikre Felix, Secretary Comr. Kako Kelly and the Public Relation Officer, Comr. Ifeta L.A and made available to journalists, stated that not all secondary school teachers in Delta state are members of ASUSS as a group and as such cannot speak for NUT
in Delta State. According to the statement, “ASUSS has been forcefully and illegally extorting unaccountable sum of five hundred naira (N500) quarterly from all Secondary Schools Teachers without their consent especially in Ughelli North and we are calling on the leadership of ASUSS in Delta state with
out delay. “The Delta State Teacher Social Security Investment Scheme (DSTSSIS) was initiated by the state wing of the NUT as a retirement saving scheme for all teachers of Delta state and the scheme has been successful and commendable by all retired teachers before the advent of ASUSS.

All Progressive Congress (APC) youths in Ajeromi-Ifelodun Local Government, have protested the exclusion of their members in the new cabinet of Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, which was inaugurated on Tuesday. They appealed to the governor to include a member of the local government in his cabinet as they had always supported the party activities. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The youths made the appeal while briefing the press on some developmental programmes expected from the current government of the state. The APC Vice Chairman in the Local Government, Mr Taofik Goriola described Governor Sanwo-Olu’s decision to neglect the community while choosing his cabinet members as devastating and unacceptable. He further appealed to the governor and party leaders to look into the plight of the community. Goriola added that the youths were not fronting for anyone as they are also capable of being selected as members of the cabinet. Mr Shakiru Amodu, the APC youth leader in the Local Government also said that “there is no doubt the community has worked so hard for the party and that it is only fair if the community members are included in the governor’s cabinet for equal representation.”

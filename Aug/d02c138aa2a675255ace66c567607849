Frank Lampard has admitted it is impossible for Chelsea to replace Eden Hazard, but urged the club’s next generation to prove they can still deliver success without the Belgian. Hazard’s last outing for Chelsea was a starring role in their Europa League Final victory over Arsenal in May and Lampard, who spent two seasons alongside the 28-year-old as team-mates before joining Manchester City on loan in August 2014, said: “I was a huge fan of Eden Hazard. I played with him. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network “For me, he is clearly one of the best players in world football. And last season, but not just last season, over his time at Chelsea, he was the most productive player in the team in terms of assists and goals. And [he was] a leader. “So, you cannot replace him individually. It is pretty much impossible because of the high, high level that he is at now in his career. “Bu the good news for us and we must stay calm and be patient with this, is that we have a group of players — some younger players, some experienced players — that now have the opportunity to show that, collectively and individually, they can step up. “Because, yes, we’re missing a huge amount of assists and goals, that’s clear, but the answer is, as a team, we have to find a way to carry on. “A football club like Chelsea will always carry on. Eden Hazard, John Terry, Didier Drogba et cetera, players move on and then it’s down to the next players, the next manager. “That’s our big challenge now, to say good luck to Eden Hazard and to carry on as Chelsea.”

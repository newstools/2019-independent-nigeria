LAGOS – While many countries are planning to consolidate budgets aiming to stabilise debt, some African countries, including Nigeria are borrowing heavily to finance big-ticket infrastructure projects. They also face potential negative economic and financing shocks due to weak fiscal positions, according to Global ratings agency Moody’s latest report. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The report disclosed that mounting public debt was forcing many countries in sub-Saharan Africa to cut development expenditure as part of fiscal consolidation measures, a reality that is threatening economic growth. Global ratings agency Moody revealed that slow growth in revenues is pushing governments to the undesirable corner of cutting down on development expenditure to meet runaway debt obligations to maintain positive credit profiles. According to the report, the fact that expenditure cuts were often easier to implement than revenue-raising measures had left many countries in a dangerous trajectory where development could suffer in the event of shocks. “In the event of shocks, scope to cut government spending rapidly and significantly, or spending flexibility, allows sovereigns to broadly adhere to their plans and lends resiliency to fiscal strength,” the report stated. In Nigeria, the legislative arm of the government in March warned of the country’s rising debt profile as they debated on the N8.83trn 2019 appropriation bill. Nigeria’s total debt stock as at March 31, 2019, stood at $81.27bn (about N24.95trn), according to the Debt Management Office (DMO). The DMO said the debt figure, which increased by 2.3 per cent in a space of three months was within the 25 per cent limit set by government with respect to gross domestic product (GDP). Besides, some West African countries, those in East Africa are also among those that had been on a borrowing spree to finance infrastructures projects resulting in a substantial surge in public debt.

The German environment ministry wants to ban plastic bags, Environment
Minister Svenja Schulze said on Sunday, according to Politico.eu
reports. “My ministry is currently working on the legal regulations for a
plastic bag ban,” the Social Democratic Party minister told the Bild
am Sonntag newspaper, adding that she wants Germany to “get out of the
throw-away society and that overall, we use less plastic.” Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Schulze said a ban will build on existing voluntary agreements with
retailers, which have led to a two-thirds drop in plastic bag use
since 2015, according to the ministry. But Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the head of the ruling Christian
Democrats and frontrunner to succeed Angela Merkel as chancellor, said
voluntary agreements are a better place to start, according to
Deutsche Welle. “If that does not work, then we can talk about prohibitions,” she said. The European Union agreed last year to ban a range of single-use
plastics from 2021.

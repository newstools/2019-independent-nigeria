India views the entire state of Jammu and Kashmir as Indian territory and believes that Pakistan governs part of it illegally. The territory controlled by India is now slated to be reorganized into two allied territories: Ladakh in the northeast, where there will be no legislative assembly, and Jammu and Kashmir, where there will be a legislative assembly, albeit one which will need permission from above to legislate on all important issues. If we observe the general situation in the country, we can assume that Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, on the autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir, will be repealed, but this is not guaranteed. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party has an absolute majority in the lower house of parliament and of course, it will approve this initiative, but there is no such majority in the upper chamber. In addition, this Indian government decision can be challenged constitutionally.

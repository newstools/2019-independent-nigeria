Kaduna – As commuters plying Kaduna-Abuja heaved a sigh of relief that the operations of kidnappers had come to an end on that road, the route still remains a danger zone as, a yet – to -be – verified number of persons were again whisked into the bushes. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The most recent incident occurred on Tuesday 27th August 2019. Eyewitnesses’ accounts state that commuters had to abandon their vehicles and flee on sighting the heavily armed gunmen. Independent learned that the kidnappers blocked the road, using articulated trucks with their tyres deflated to achieve this and were in the process of kidnapping more passengers, but for the timely arrival of former Gombe Governor, Ibrahim Hassan Dankwambo’s convoy at the scene, whose security details fired several gunshots that helped to disperse the kidnappers. A source told Independent that, people were made to believe that the nefarious activities of these dare-devil kidnappers had ceased but in truth, it only subsided, giving commuters false hope of being secure. The source told Independent that they had to park their vehicle and flee for safety. Madam Dorothy Audu (Not Real Names) lamented the situation on the road, “I work in Abuja while my family is resident in Kaduna, so I pass this road every week. “As soon as I board a vehicle from Abuja to Kaduna, my whole being is overtaken by fear until I alight at the Kaduna park, then I thank God. This is what I suffer every week”. “We are pleading with the government to come to our aid. The government should help us to end this nightmare, the kidnappers are ruthless. I hear from freed kidnapped victims that they show no one any mercy except the grace is upon you. If not, as soon as you are kidnapped, you are at risk. “Many were kidnapped but the arrival and intervention of the former governor and his security people saved other commuters from being kidnapped even though some abandoned their vehicles and ran into the bushes.

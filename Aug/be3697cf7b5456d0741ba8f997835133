Alsoadura, noted that the use of e-governance “has made public service delivery far more effective and efficient, and thereby pumping out remarkable Public Sector productivity. “Deploying such technologies that meet today’s needs and anticipates the future, has brought government closer to the people, especially those who equally have proficiency in the use of information and communication technology.” The minister, however, said government needed to be proactive in adopting new technologies to enable it deliver effectively its monitoring, regulatory and oversight responsibilities over the private sector. “It would be unimaginable for government to regulate banks and other businesses with technology-oriented business models if government lacked the necessary technology scope,” he added. He said that although most of the development in technology “are focused on the private sector, the public sector should not be left behind,” as the government had the responsibility of developing and implementing rule-based policies for the private sector to thrive. Alasoadura enjoined the participants to make maximum use of their time at the summit, and multiply their productivity at their respective duty posts with the e-government tools acquired, for greater national productivity and growth.

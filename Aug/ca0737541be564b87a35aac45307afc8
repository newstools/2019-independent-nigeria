OWERRI – The immediate past governor of Imo State, Rochas Okoro­cha has been advised to desist from the barrage of attacks on the current government of Emeka Ihedioha in the state. The Imo Peoples Demo­cratic Party (PDP) Elders Council gave the advice at a press briefing held at the party’s secretariat in Owerri. Speaking on behalf of the body, three chieftains of the party Peter Mgben­welu, Ambrose Ejiogu and Osita Nwaneri warned that should Okorocha fail to keep quiet and allow Ihedioha to work in peace, they would be compelled to make him “ politically uncomfortable “. Besides, the party warned the ex-governor and now Sen­ator representing Imo West to give peace a chance in the state without constituting and not to constitute a distraction to the state government. They said, “We as custo­dians of conscience of this party, the Imo PDP, and we will not allow any ostenta­tious politician to distract the present PDP government of Rt. Hon. Emeka Ihedioha in the state. “We want to let Okoro­cha to know that we are old enough to know and that we know enough to be able to make him uncom­fortable politically and in other spheres of his life. “As elders, we are saying this as the first and last warning for him to desist from his reckless, baseless utterances and attacks on the governor failing which we will come out on him.”

LAGOS – A package of $251 million was yesterday approved at the ongoing G7 to support women entrepreneurs in Africa through effort of the African Development Bank (AfDB)’s Affirmative Finance Action for Women in Africa (AFAWA) initiative. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The risk-sharing mechanism used by AFAWA is a practical approach to international commitments. Akinwumi Adesina, the Bank’s president, applauded the “extraordinary support of all the G7 heads of state and government, which will provide incredible momentum” to the AFAWA programme. He noted that currently, women operate over 40% of SMEs in Africa, but there is a financing gap of $42 billion between male and female entrepreneurs. “It is a direct response to the demand by women to ease access to financing, specifically on the need to establish a financing mechanism for women’s economic empowerment, adopted during a summit of African heads of state in 2015 and assigned to the African Development Bank for implementation. “AFAWA aims to raise up to $5 billion for African women entrepreneurs and the African Development Bank will provide $1 billion financing”, he said. He, however, said: “The AFAWA initiative, backed by the G7 nations, is based on three fundamental principles. The first is to improve women’s access to financing through innovative and adapted financial instruments, including guarantee mechanisms to support women entrepreneurs”.

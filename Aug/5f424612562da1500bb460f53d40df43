LAGOS – Immediate past Secretary to the Lagos State Government, Tunji Bello, on Thursday, disclosed that he once served as the speech writer of the late Moshood Kashimawo Abiola (MKO). Bello made this revelation when he appeared before the 16-man ad-hoc committee set up by the state House of Assembly to screen the commissioner nominees of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The former SSG, while answering questions from the committee members, revealed that he had worked in several places and at a point worked as the speech writer of the late Abiola. The former Commissioner for the Environment in Lagos, who is also lawyer and journalist, advised that the state must intensify efforts on waste management and conversion. According to him, “There are a few areas you can set up dumpsite in Lagos State because the state is below the sea level. You cannot set up a dump site in Lagos Island, except in places like Agege, Abule Egba and others. “On flooding in Lagos, we have nine main drainages in the state, and while six are developed, three are not developed. The Lagos Mainland drainage system is the oldest and it has about six divisions. The tertiary drainages and channels must link up with primary channels,” he said. Bello’s argument was corroborated by the Chairman of the Committee, Rotimi Abiru, who stated that everybody was concerned about the environment in the state.

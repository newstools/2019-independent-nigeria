It has been gathered that there is no love lost between Manu Garba, the coach of the World Cup-bound U17 team, and the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) over alleged imposition of players from the latter. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network An online medium reported that Garba are at daggers drawn with officials of the NFF over the invitation of two league players to the ongoing Nigeria U17 training camp in Abuja. It is understood that an official of the NFF from the Yoruba-speaking part of the country had instructed Manu Garba to include Sunshine Stars winger, Adejubu Ayobami, and Akure City FC midfielder, Awosanmi Promise, in the team. The Golden Eaglets coaches have argued that both players are above the age limit even though they claim to be born in 2004. There is an unwritten rule that no player representing a league side should be in the Golden Eaglets squad and that was the reason Nasarawa United striker, Ibrahim Sanusi, was decamped last week. Garba and his assistants are wary of the country being banned by FIFA for fielding overage players and have vowed not to take Ayobami and Awosanmi to Brazil. The other bone of contention is the invitation of the ‘Zenith Bank Boys’ to the Golden Eaglets squad.

Juventus have no interest in arranging a swap deal with Inter involving Mauro Icardi and Paulo Dybala, according to Gazzetta dello Sport. The Bianconeri are expected to sell La Joya before the transfer window shuts but remain reluctant to even consider a player exchange. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Icardi has a pact with the Italian champions and may continue to reject all other offers in a bid to leave Inter with no alternative. GdS reported: “It might seem strange, but it seems Icardi and Dybala are adopting the same strategy without them knowing it. “They’ve both delayed decisions on their future up until now but 2 September is no longer that far away. It’s time to make their big decision. ”Dybala came close to joining Manchester United and Tottenham before the Premier League market closed, but Juventus were unable to push either move over the line. Paris Saint-Germain are the only other club who have been linked with the forward after Inter, but they may not move for Dybala until they have resolved Neymar’s future.

With Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez watching from the stands, Antoine Griezmann came through for Barcelona by scoring twice to lead the Catalan club to its first Spanish league win of the season with a 5-2 rout of Real Betis on Sunday. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Griezmann celebrated his second goal by going near the Barcelona fans and throwing glitter into the air like NBA star LeBron James. “I like LeBron’s ritual and I tried to imitate him,” Griezmann said. “I wanted to copy that. I bought the confetti on the Internet with my family.” The newly signed France forward had already scored the first goal for Barcelona after Betis opened the scoring at Camp Nou. “I see Leo Messi score goals like that in training and I tried to copy him, ” Griezmann said after the match. Carles Perez, Jordi Alba and Arturo Vidal also scored for Barcelona. Nabil Fekir and Loren Moron scored for Betis. Barcelona had lost 1-0 at Athletic Bilbao last weekend for its first opening league defeat in a decade. Messi had already missed the opener because of a calf injury, while Suarez got hurt before halftime in Bilbao. Forward Ousmane Dembele also was out injured. Griezmann, who joined from Atletico Madrid for €120 million in the offseason, had started at Barcelona with a lacklustre performance in the opener. But he took charge on Sunday, scoring his first goal after sliding to a cross from Sergi Roberto in the 41st minute. Griezmann’s second came in the 50th with a well-placed left-footed shot that curled into the far corner, just out of reach of Betis goalkeeper Dani Martín. Griezmann was handed glitter from someone who appeared to be a Barcelona staff member behind the goal, then threw it up in the air.

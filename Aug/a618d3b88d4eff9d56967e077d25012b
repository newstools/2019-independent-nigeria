LAGOS – Players in the Nigerian aviation industry have advocated for the merger and consolidation among domestic carriers in order to curb incessant collapse of airlines in the country. The stakeholders at a meeting organised by Aviation Round Table (ART) recently in Lagos, argued that it was necessary for at least eight airlines at present in the sector to collapse into just two operating carriers, emphasised that this would be the permanent solution to their crises.

The participants noted that in the past two decades, more than 50 airlines entered the market, with most of them disappearing as quickly as they started via mismanagement or through insolvency. They maintained that between 1979 -2013 there were over 50 airlines that have gone bankrupt. Mr. Allen Onyema, the Managing Director of Air Peace, claimed that his entry into the industry had resulted in lower airfares and increased frequencies. He further said that he had made efforts in assisting other airlines in making profits despite barriers such as high taxes, airport fees and strenuous certification process, which he noted makes it very difficult for operators to attract investment capital. Onyema stated that lack of access to runway slots and terminals gates at other African and International airports limit Nigerian airlines’ ability to enter and compete in the international aviation market. He, however, stated that Air Peace has recorded an impressive 80 percent load factor on its maiden international flight, which he reiterated is expected to rise. He added that the airline’s frequency of operations will give it room to review its operations and gradually improve until it achieves excellence in all its routes.

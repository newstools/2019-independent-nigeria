After a summer dominated by the prospect of Crystal Palace star Wilfried Zaha moving to Everton, it feels rather apt that the two sides should meet on the opening day of the new Premier League season. Palace have spent the summer preparing for the daunting prospect of life without Zaha, but the Ivorien has been unable to detach himself from the club, despite his best efforts to force the issue. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The 26-year-old is unlikely to be available to face the Toffees but his retention by the South London club as unexpected as it may have seemed, will be a welcome boost for Roy Hodgsonâ€™s side who appear to be worryingly thin on the ground ahead of the new campaign. While new recruits have been in short supply for the Eagles, the same cannot be said for Everton, who now boast a squad that simply will not settle for a third-successive eighth-place finish this season. Marco Silva will be aiming to build on a quietly impressive finish to the 2018-19 campaign, one that saw impressive victories over Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United. With the Toffees avoiding defeat in nine of their last 10 visits to the south Londoners, the Portuguese coach will be confident of extending that trend.

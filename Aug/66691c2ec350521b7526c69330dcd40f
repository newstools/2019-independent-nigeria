Oil prices rose yesterday with U.S. crude gaining 1 per cent after an inventory report indicated that the U.S. stockpiles fell more than expected, helping ease worries about economic growth due to the Sino-U.S. trade war. Brent crude was up by 37 cents, or 0.6 per cent at $59.88 a barrel while the West Texas Intermediate crude was up 55 cents, or 1.0 per cent at $55.48 a barrel. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network U.S. crude stockpiles fell sharply last week as imports dropped, plummeting by 11.1 million barrels, compared with expectations for a two million barrel draw, data from industry group, the American Petroleum Institute, API, showed. The U.S. government’s weekly report is due to be released this morning and if official numbers confirm the API data then it will be the biggest weekly decline in nine weeks. “The mammoth crude inventory draw has, at least for the time being, put to rest those U.S. recessionary doom and gloom fears that have been hanging over oil markets like a dark cloud,” said Stephen Innes, managing partner at Valour Markets. Still, concerns about global growth amid the raging trade war between the United States and China are likely to cap gains. It would be recalled that the U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday said that he believed China was sincere about wanting to reach a deal, while Chinese Vice Premier Liu He said China was willing to resolve the dispute through “calm” negotiations. On Tuesday, however, concerns about trade resurfaced after China’s foreign ministry that it had not heard of any recent telephone call between the United States and China on trade, and said it hopes Washington can stop its wrong actions and create conditions for talks.

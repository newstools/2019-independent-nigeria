Lagos – Trabzonspor of Turkey have given their new summer arrival, John Mikel Obi a clean bill of health, with the Super Eagles ex-midfielder and immediate past captain cleared medically to commence pre-season training. In contrast with initial worries that he could face fitness issues, due to the injury he copped at the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), Mikel has been declared physically okay by medics by the club. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network “Ekuban and our new transfer Mikel, who are in the national teams of their countries due to the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), passed the health check. “The players who completed their health checks continued their work at Mehmet Ali Yılmaz Facilities within the special training program applied to them,” Trabzonspor disclosed. Details of the report reveal that Mikel had a successful medical check days after sealing a two-year deal with the club in June. Despite confirmation of Mikel’s health clearance, additional information from Trabzonspor, however, revealed that the experienced holding ace may miss the club’s UEFA Europa League qualifier away to Sparta Prague of Czech Republic, as he has not played in any pre-season game. Mikel, though, will now hope to make Trabzonspor’s opening day fixture in the Super Lig, alongside fellow-former Super Eagles’ midfielder, Ogenyi Onazi, who is also close to full fitness, after copping a thigh muscle tear towards the end of last year. Trabzonspor will face Kasimpasa on the opening day of the season on August 18, in a match that would accord Mikel an early opportunity to prove he still has something to offer at club level, as he aims to justify his arrival at Medical Park Stadium, with a contract that should run until 2021, with an option of an extension for a further year. Mikel will now wear jersey number 12 for the season, thereby reviving a tradition he started at Chelsea.

AWKA – A chieftain of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Tony Ifeanya, has restated the party’s stand to pick its governorship candidate from Anambra-South Senatorial District for the 2021 election. Ifeanya, who is the state secretary of the party, explained that APGA’s decision was predicated on its strong belief in the principles of justice, equity fairness and good conscience. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network It will be recalled that in the present political dispensation in Anambra-South took the first shot at governorship position when Chinwoke Mbadinuju was elected in 1999. He was succeeded by candidates from Anambra-Central in Chris Ngige, who was removed by the election tribunal for Peter Obi to serve his tenure. When it appeared impossible for Anambra-North to produce its own candidate, Obi and one other group known as Olu n’Adagbe led by Shadrack Anakwue, campaigned vigorously and Willie Obiano emerged from North. Now that the governorship position has gone full circle, Ifeanya said that “given the fact that Anambra Central and Anambra North Senatorial Districts have had their turns of occupying the governorship seat of the state since 2003, it will be fair for Governor Willie Obiano’s successor in 2022, to come from the South Senatorial District”. He maintained that the zoning and rotation formula of APGA will continue to promote peaceful coexistence and harmonious relationship among the people of the three senatorial districts of Anambra State. According to him, the restoration of peace and stability, in addition to the unprecedented delivery of democracy dividends by APGA government in Anambra State in the past 13 years have endeared the party to the people of the state.

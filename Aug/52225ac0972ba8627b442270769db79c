Two mechanics, Akeem Taiwo, 44, and Saheed Shittu, 49, on Monday appeared before an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court over the alleged conversion to personal use, of a customer’s N300,000, meant for the repair of his faulty Ford car. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Both defendants, who reside in Ebutemetta area of Lagos State, were arraigned on a three-count charge of conspiracy, stealing and obtaining money under false pretences; offences they denied committing. The prosecutor, Sgt. Mike Unah, said that the defendants committed the offences on March 2, at No. 11, Fagbeyi Ige Olusi St., Hopeville Estate, Ajah, Lagos State. Unah alleged that the duo collected N300,000 from the complainant, Mr Stephen Ayeni, promising to help him to repair his Ford car. “The defendants claimed that they specialize in repairing of Ford cars, which claim they knew was false,” the prosecutor said. He told the court that the defendants, rather than effect the repairs on the car, converted the sum of N300,000 paid by the complainant to their personal use. “All attempts made by Ayeni to get his money back from the duo were unsuccessful,’’ Unah said. The prosecutor said that the offences contravened Sections 411, 287 and 314 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The  News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that while Section 287 stipulates three years imprisonment for stealing, Section 314 provides for a 15-year jail term for obtaining under false pretence. The Magistrate, Mr A. A Fashola, granted the defendants bail in the sum of N100, 000 each with two sureties in like sum and adjourned the case until Sept. 18, for mention.

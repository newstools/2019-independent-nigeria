Turkey and the United States on Wednesday agreed to jointly establish a safe zone in Syria’s north, a day after fresh Turkish threats for a military offensive against U.S.-backed Kurdish militia in the region.

However, Turkish President, Tayyip Erdogan, had earlier threatened an incursion very soon in spite talks with the U.S.

The statement read, “the governor of Ondo State, Oluwarotimi Odunayo Akeredolu, has directed the Governing Board of Rufus Giwa Polytechnic, Owo, to commence the immediate enumeration of workers likely to be affected by the planned commercialisation of the institution’s Staff School. “The governor’s directive, which comes on the heels of the fears and concern expressed by persons who may possibly be affected by the decision of the Governing Board, however, targets those who were originally workers of the institution seconded to the Staff School. “For the avoidance of doubt, the Polytechnic’s Staff School is neither owned nor run by the State Government. It is a wholly private business venture by the institution. “The salaries and other benefits of workers of the Staff School have never been the burden of the state government since the establishment of the Staff School.”

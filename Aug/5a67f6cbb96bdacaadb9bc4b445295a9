There will be two weeks of junior tournaments in Abuja in November, following the approval from tennis’ world governing body, the International Tennis Federation (ITF). The Nigeria Tennis Federation, in a bid to further improve the growth of the sport in the country and also concentrate on the development of junior players, had earlier applied for nine weeks of junior tournaments, but the ITF granted only two, which was supposed to hold July. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network However, because of some new court modifications that the ITF wanted the NTF to implement, the tournaments were postponed. In June, during the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Confederation of Africa Tennis (CAT) in Madagascar the NTF President, Engr. Dayo Akindoju reiterated the federation’s plans to host the junior tournaments this year. Thankfully, the case was heard and approval has been granted, and the court modifications will be completed next year. “In my last visit to Madagascar for the CAT AGM, I was lucky that all decision makers in ITF came for the meeting to do some presentation from ITF to CAT,” Engr. Akindoju said. “My case was heard and approved that this year we are going to be allowed to host tournament in the same venue [Abuja], but by next year we should ensure that the court modifications are done.” “We have now gotten confirmation from the ITF that two weeks of U-18 ITF Junior Tournament will hold in the month of November in Abuja.” For the first week, the tournament known as J5 Abuja will hold from November 4 to 10, with the qualifying draw taking place on the 2nd and 3rd. Main draw action for the second week begins from November 11 to 17, with the qualifying draw action holding on November 9 and 10. TENNIS CIRCUIT gathered that the junior tournaments are a part of the NTF’s plans to develop tennis from the grassroots, with the Federation also pushing for the establishment of a High Performance Centre in the country.

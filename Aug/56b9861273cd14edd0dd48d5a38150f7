MelodyVR has announced a VR content creation and distribution agreement with Beggars Group. The agreement means the virtual reality platform will have the right to create and distribute both live and pre-recorded VR content created with artists from the group’s labels. MelodyVR has built the world’s largest library of immersive, interactive virtual reality music experiences. Earlier this year, it live-streamed the Wireless Festival in VR attracting around 250,000 viewers – close to double the audience that attended the event physically. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Anthony Matchett, founder, and CEO of Melody VR said: “I’m pleased to enter into this agreement with Beggars and look forward to working with their exceptional, diverse roster of independent talent, to create groundbreaking immersive virtual reality experiences for their fans.” Home of 4AD, Matador, Rough Trade, XL Recordings and Young Turks, Beggars’ labels represent artists including The National, FKA Twigs, Black Midi, Jungle, Queens of the Stone Age, Big Thief, The xx, Amyl & The Sniffers, King Krule, Grimes, Interpol, Aldous Harding, Kurt Vile, Kamasi Washington and Radiohead. Simon Wheeler, Beggars’ director of commercial strategy, said: “We’re pleased to be working with MelodyVR to bring the extraordinary artists that our labels work with to the fast-growing audiences in virtual reality, I will be fascinated to see what creativity we can cook up together and create exciting new music experiences.” The deal follows a number of previous partnerships MelodyVR has entered into since its inception, spanning labels, publishers and venues.

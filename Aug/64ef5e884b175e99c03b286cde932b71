ENUGU – Prof. Godwin Owoh, the chairman of the Enugu State sectoral ad-hoc committee on Finance, Review of Internally Generated Revenue and International Development Partners’ Funding, has commended Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi for the innovation and far-reaching reforms his administration introduced in the State Internal Revenue Service. He said innovation was responsible for the impressive increase in its Internally Generated Revenue (IGR). Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Owoh noted that Enugu State was leading and has one of the strongest IGR automation mechanisms in the country, based on their “comparative analysis of about six similar states” in terms of accessing, collection and accounting for tax and other government revenues. The chairman spoke when he led members of his committee alongside other four committees in the second batch of the 12 sectoral ad-hoc committees, constituted by Ugwunayi to review sectors of government for optimized service delivery and advancement of good governance, to submit their reports.

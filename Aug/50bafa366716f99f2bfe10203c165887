MINNA – Motorists plying the Minna-Bida road in Niger State have made a passionate appeal to the federal and state governments to come to their aid to check the worsening state of the road, describing it as a death trap and disaster waiting to happen. The 89 kilometres road linking Minna with other communities, including Bida and neighbouring Kwara State, the commuters said, was being threatened almost on annual basis at Kateregi and Gada area linking Kaka
kpangyi with others communities at the peak of the rainy season. Some transporters told our correspondent that huge gullies arising from failed portions at the neck of the Kateregi bridge linking Gada and Kakakpangyi village had turned the road into death trap, making it almost impassable as it had almost been cut off by the river flow. One of the drivers, who gave his name simply as Ndama, lamented that most transporters and other road users were being forced to embark on risky driving on the edge of the cliffs, on the road shoulders or the low val
ley at the swampy parts ahead of the bridge. The poor state of the Minna-Bida road for over two years now, Ndama said, had not only caused severe damage on their vehicles, but could pose serious danger to motorists, especially first time travellers along the route, who did not know the state of the road. Niger State government last year claimed it had awarded contract for the reconstruction of the Minna-Bida road at the cost of over N2.1 billion, but the impact of the said contract was not being felt. Only last year, the leader
ship of the National Union of Road Transport Owners (NURTO) and the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) jointly pleaded with the state government in a statement to repair the road to stem recurring huge road carnages and causing economic losses resulting from crashes, damages to vehicles and loss of man hour while journeying on the road. Traditional institutions, our correspondent gathered, also added their voice through repeated appeals drawing the attention of the state government on the need to pay attention, but all the outcries failed to yield desired results Powered by RubiQube Ad Network

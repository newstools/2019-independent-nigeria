Since the exit of former Lagos State Governor, Akinwunmi Ambode, VisionScape has ceased to function on the streets of Lagos, in terms of disposing waste. Their activities are now being replaced by PSP (which was the group formerly in charge of that responsibility). Powered by RubiQube Ad Network TV Independent went out on the streets of Lagos, to get the view of several residents of different areas as regards this development. Please share your view in the comment section below if PSP is performing better than VisionScape. â€”

Serbia’s CIP Transport Institute has announced that the construction of a new bridge on Belgrade’s Sava river is expected to begin in 2020, Serbian news agency eKapija has reported. The plan is that the contractor should be selected by the end of the year, to start implementing the project in early 2020,” said CIP chief designer Dejan Srejić, one of the authors of the new bridge’s preliminary design report. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network As part of the project, the Old Sava Bridge on the river will be relocated before construction of the new one begins. The new bridge will fit well visually with the existing bridges. However, in addition to the parts of the structure designed to connect the bridge to existing Belgrade bridges, the new bridge also has a unique aesthetic,” the preliminary design report reads. CIP won the competition to design the new bridge in 2017 and will work together with a contractor yet to be decided in late 2019. Early project costs are estimated at 30 million euros. Planned to be 420 meters long, the new bridge will have two lanes for cars, two corridors for trams and subways, as well as sidewalks for cyclists and pedestrians.

A major high street coffee shop has renamed the sizes of its cups in a move that could mean you get a third less coffee. Costa Coffee’s old “small” cup (340ml) is now being called “medium”, the old “medium” (455ml), is now the “large” and the old large (568ml) is “extra large”. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The chain – which has 2,467 shops in the UK – is also introducing a tiny new “small” cup which contains just 227ml of drink – a third less than the old “small” option. However, prices have not been reduced to take into account the size and name alterations – instead, they have all been increased by 10p. So it means someone who previously paid £2.45 for a “medium” coffee, must now order a “large” for £2.85.
But if they still ask for a “medium” they will pay £2.55 – and get less coffee. The changes affect takeaway cups as well as the china ones used in-store. Costa Coffee is the latest in a string of retailers and manufacturers to join the ‘shrinkflation’ bandwagon , with producers downsizing products to cut costs. In most cases recommended retail prices will stay the same, however in the case of Costa, it will go up. Costa has grown from a small London establishment 47 years ago to become the UK’s largest coffee chain. The brand was launched by Italian brothers Sergio and Bruno Costa with a single store in Vauxhall Bridge Road, Victoria, in 1971. The business was sold to Whitbread for £19million in 1995 – today, it says it’s on track to hit sales of £2.5billion by 2020.

AWKA – Advancement in science and transportation has changed the pattern of spread of diseases especially meningitis in Nigeria, and so parents should immunise their children, medical experts have advised. Dr. Chioma Ezenyemulu, the executive secretary and chief executive officer of Anambra State Primary Health Care Development Agency (ASPHCDA), gave this warning at the weekend during the flag off of Men A, a new vaccine for treatment of meningitis among children. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Ezenyemulu, who was represented by the Head of Disease Control and Immunization, Dr. Uliagbafusi Placid Nnamdi, said this is the reason why states hitherto not considered to be in the meningitis belt are embarking on immunization. According to her, meningitis, which affects under children under five years in Nigeria used to be dominant in 25 to 26 states in Nigeria. But now though apart from some states being in the meningitis belt, “The global nature of the world today with high mobility of Nigerians has rendered the issue of meningitis belt irrelevant. “Today, Nigerians will say goodnight Kano and good morning in Anambra State the next day. Transmission of meningitis, therefore, defies the documents called belt”, she said. She said that to further protect children and improve the health status of children the National Primary Health Care Development Agency introduced Men A vaccine nationwide. In his speech the Permanent Secretary of Ministry of Health, Dr. John Ogechukwu Ndibe, who represented Governor Willie Obiano, said that World Bank and other partners were planning to introduce Men A for adults.

I added another N200, but he still refused and insisted that I most give him N1000. “Then his colleague stood in front of the windscreen and pointed his gun at us. “I was still negotiating with the officer who demanded the N1000 when I heard a gunshot and my colleague screamed, saying ‘they have killed him, they have killed him.’ “I turned and saw my boss lying dead, with blood gushing out from his head, where the bullet hit him. I immediately came out of the vehicle and asked “who killed my boss? “The one who did it immediately ran and disappeared into the bush, while the remaining ones quickly entered their vehicle and zoomed off,” he said.

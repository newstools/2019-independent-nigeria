Tropical Storm ‘Dorian’ threatened Puerto Rico with a direct hit on Wednesday, as forecasters said it made a last-minute shift in its path and could reach near-hurricane strength in its approach to the US territory. The storm is expected to pass over or near western and central Puerto Rico, with landslides, widespread flooding and power outages possible. President Donald Trump declared an emergency Tuesday night (Wednesday in Manila) and ordered federal assistance for local authorities, according to reports by The Manila Times.

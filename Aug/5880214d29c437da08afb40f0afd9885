Tunisia’s electoral commission said on Wednesday it had approved 26
candidates including two women for next month’s presidential election,
rejecting 71 other applicants. The September 15 vote follows the death last month of Beji Caid
Essebsi at age 92 – first president to be democratically elected in
Tunisia after the uprising of 2011.

The Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) yesterday warned the general public of the continuous activities of impostors and fake news websites that are spreading falsehood regarding “AMCON 2019/2020 Recruitment Exercise”. To avoid falling into the deadly trap of fraudulent agents, the public is hereby informed that these stories are brazen falsehood, and are meant to mislead innocent job seekers as well as the public as AMCON is not currently recruiting, and did not engage any agency whatsoever to recruit on its behalf. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network “We therefore call on all stakeholders and indeed all Nigerians at home and in the Diaspora to kindly disregard these misrepresentations and beware of online fraudsters who claim to work for or represent AMCON as the Corporation is not recruiting at the moment. “To avoid being misled in terms of the origin of any news and information being circulated and bearing resemblance to our identity, kindly scrutinise any such news or information claiming to be from “AMCON”, by confirming the information on our website. Should AMCON decide to recruit anytime in the future, it does that directly from its Abuja office”.

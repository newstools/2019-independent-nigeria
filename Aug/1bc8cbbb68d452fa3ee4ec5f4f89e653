A man has been charged over an indecent assault in Edinburgh almost three years ago. Police said the 40-year-old was arrested on Tuesday at Edinburgh Airport after being extradited from Germany. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network It followed an incident in the city’s Salisbury Place on 2 October 2016, when a 19-year-old woman was dragged into a garden and attacked by a man in a kilt. The 40-year-old man is due to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court later. Det Sgt David Brady said: “This has been a complex inquiry that has required continued engagement with colleagues in Germany and we are grateful for their assistance. The sexual crime of any form will not be tolerated and time is no barrier for our investigation. Whenever such offenses take place we will utilize all resources at our disposal and work with all relevant partners to bring those responsible to justice.”

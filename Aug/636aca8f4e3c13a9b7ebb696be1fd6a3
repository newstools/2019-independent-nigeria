Onu contended that for Nigeria to sustain its status as the largest economy in Africa, it must increase her productivity through science and technology. He told the management and staff of the ministry that “we all have the responsibility of making sure we move away from our dependence on foreign products and rely on our knowledge and innovation to grow made in Nigeria products. “Once we are able to do this, we now give our economy opportunity to grow on a very faster rate.

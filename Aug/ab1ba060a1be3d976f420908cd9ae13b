Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Addressing newsmen in Umuahia, the factional state chairman of APGA in the state. Nkem Okoro, accused the factional national chairman of the party, Chief Victor Oye, of creating problems within the party. He said, “Sadly Abia happens to be one of the states where he assured state and LGA officers, including the grossly incompetent ones that he was going to return all of them so that they could return him as chairman. “In the case of Dr Alex Otti, they childishly accused him of being interested in running for the office of national chairman and in panic, they deployed some renegades who announced that Otti had been suspended from the party, but when they didn’t get the cheap attention they were seeking, they activated the latest move which is to attempt the withdrawal of APGA from the governorship petition.” He disclosed that a date has been fixed by the tribunal for adoption of the final written addresses by parties, “so the case has been progressing very well”.

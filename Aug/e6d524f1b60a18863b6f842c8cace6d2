Jurgen Klopp has again hinted he may walk away from football when his contract with Liverpool expires in 2022. The Reds boss was in Germany early this week to receive a prestigious coach of the year award from an influential newspaper in his homeland. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network And true to his character, he offered a quip in an interview after picking up the award, that has started a few alarm bells ringing back on Merseyside. Klopp was far from in a serious mood as he suggested he doesn’t know what he will do in three years times…and could even retire. But taken with his previous comments from a year ago, when he suggested he could leave the game far earlier than most coaches, it suggests the prospect has certainly. The German coach has always honoured his contracts at every club he has managed, and he has reiterated that not only will he stay at Liverpool, but it’s pure co-incidence his current Anfield deal would take him to seven years at the club – the same period he managed at both Mainz and Dortmund. In accepting the award, he was asked what is next in his career after lifting the Champions League, and he replied: “I hope to continue like this, but in two, three years I don’t know what may happen. “Maybe I’ll retire!” It was said in a lighthearted way, but then he added: “It doesn’t necessarily mean it will happen, however, but if that were the case, you wouldn’t be surprised.” Paris Saint-Germain are

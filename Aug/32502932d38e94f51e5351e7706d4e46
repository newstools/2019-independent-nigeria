According to reports in France, ex-Arsenal midfielder Jeff Reine-Adelaide is said to be closing in on a move to Lyon that could be worth up to €30 million with add-ons, according to Arseblog.news reports. The Gunners sold the France under-21 international to Angers this time last year for just £2 million but had the sense to insert a sell-on clause. It sounds as though Arsenal will get 10 per cent of any upcoming fee, which is better than nothing. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network ‘The Jeff’ was recruited in 2015 from Lens and immediately set tongues wagging with a couple of great performances in the Emirates Cup. Just 17 at the time, he looked a certainty to make the jump up to the first team but lost his way a bit as Arsene Wenger’s tenure came to an end. Ultimately, a desire to get his career back on track with regular senior football influenced his decision to leave and Arsenal’s to sell. PSV’s Donyell Malen, Bayern Munich’s Serge Gnabry and AC Milan’s Ismael Bennacer did much the same and have all started to deliver on their potential at big clubs. The North London club even got a £4 million sell-on fee for the latter. Lyon, Monaco and Porto are also said to be keeping tabs on Reine-Adelaide, who Arsenal recently encountered in a pre-season friendly. Clubs in France and Portugal have until 2 September to conclude their summer business.

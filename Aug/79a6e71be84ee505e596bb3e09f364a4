Fiorentina forward, Kevin-Prince Boateng, has welcomed Franck Ribery to the club following the completion of his permanent move. The former Bayern Munich star completed a free transfer to the Serie A club on Wednesday. After departing Bayern Munich at the end of last season, Ribery penned a two-year deal with the Viola to become their seventh signing of the summer. The Frenchman’s arrival is expected to boost the attacking options in Vincenzo Montella’s squad as they aim for a place in Europe this term. Boateng who joined Fiorentina from Sassuolo last month, is relishing the opportunity to play alongside his former opponent in the German Bundesliga.

Super Falcons team to next week’s 2020 Olympics qualifying match against Algeria will depart Nigeria on Saturday. Head Coach Thomas Dennerby has already submitted a list of 18 home –based professionals who will do battle with the Algerians, following the inability of foreign –based players to make the trip due to various engagements with their clubs.

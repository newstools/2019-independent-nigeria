Speaking after losing 5-0 to Enyimba on Sunday, the coach, whose side was participating in the CAF Champions League for the first time, admitted that they played against a highly technical and gifted side, concluding that with more hard work and commitment, the record Nigerian champions could go all the way. “It was a very difficult match for us, especially after we had our main forward, Zonon Issouf, sent off just eight minutes into the match. “But I am not taking anything away from Enyimba because they are a highly technical team capable of winning the cup if they can only remain humble and take every match as they come. “They have what it takes to win this cup; they have experienced players, so I knew the match was going to be a hard one for us,” he told the local media. Meanwhile, Coach Usman Abd’Allah of Enyimba has urged his players to remain humble and committed, saying that the task ahead was far bigger than defeating the Burkina Faso side. Enyimba will on September 13 host Sudanese side, Al Hilal Omdurman, while the return leg comes up in a two-week time. The aggregate winner qualifies for the group stage of the CAF Champions League. Meanwhile, the club’s secretary, Chibuzo Nwogu, is excited over the club’s 5-0 trouncing of Rahimo. He said that one thing Enyimba will avoid in subsequent matches was to lose away. According to him, losing away could be disastrous if the team fails to upturn them at home and this could cut short their hopes of proceeding to the advanced stage of the competition.

LAGOS – Leicester City of England midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi has expressed disappointment that his side could not beat Chelsea, as he believes The Foxes should have claimed the three points in their English Premier League (EPL) game on Sunday. Although The Foxes played away in the encounter, Ndidi insisted they were the better side, but took consolation in how he scored the equalizer late in the second half, after his first half error allowed The Blues go ahead.

We tried to come back in the second half, with better spirit and we tried to push forward. “Getting this point, we’re not really happy, we’re kind of sad because we dominated the second half which could have brought a better result for us. “We’re really pleased. I keep saying, the first half was really bad. I feel bad about it. It was a mixed feeling because we should have got the three points even after the first half. “We’re not here to compete, we’re here to contend. All of the guys have a good spirit and we know what we want this season. “There’s lots of positives for us in the second half. We’ll try to take it to the next game because we know we can actually do it”, Ndidi told LCFC TV. Leicester City will next slug it out with newly-promoted side Sheffield United on Saturday, August 24.

An organization which sends free subscription book parcels to children in poverty hopes to make a ‘profound’ difference in youngsters’ lives. Dee-Dee Crosher set up Pathenaeum two years ago and the project is now asking for professionals working with disadvantaged kids to nominate worthy recipients of free reading material. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network While investigating how to help children in poverty, she discovered how hard it is for those in need to get hold of children’s resources Athenaeum is aimed at giving all UK children easy access to educational resources, and the service can be free to those in poverty. In total, 50% of Pathenaeum’s profits go to providing free subscription boxes for schools and children. Ms. Crosher said: “If one disadvantaged child in a classroom gets access to the best learning resources at home the impact of the benefits the child receives will be felt across the entire classroom. The impact is getting at home too, creating happier families and therefore happier communities. Books included in the subscription packages, which are free for at least the first 6 months, include classics such as Julia Donaldson’s The Gruffalo and Michael Bond’s Paddington. Other books on offer include Christopher Paul Curtis’s Bud, Not Buddy and The One and Only Ivan by Katherine Applegate. Children eligible for the project can be nominated by professionals including social workers, youth workers, teachers, GPs and police officers. A full list of the individuals and organizations which can nominate children in poverty for support is available on the Athenaeum’s website.

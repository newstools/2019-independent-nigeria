Anambra State Governor, Willie Obiano, has advised his admirers and well-wishers to pray for him and channel whatever they might have budgeted to celebrate his 63rd birthday  in the media to charity. In a statement by C. Don Adinuba, Commissioner for Information & Public Enlightenment, the governor encouraged his well-wishers to donate in particular to the Caring Family Enhancement Initiative (CAFÉ), a nongovernment organization founded and headed by the First Lady of Anambra State, Mrs. Ebelechukwu Obiano, Osodieme.

We are pleased that an almost countless number of persons, communities and groups not only in Anambra State but throughout the country and even beyond are satisfied with the governor’s performance in the last five years and are willing to contribute significant.” “Governor Obiano is using the occasion of his 63rd anniversary to call public attention to the plight of people with mental illness and requests public spirited individuals and groups to donate generously to their cause. God loves cheerful givers, as the Holy Writ tells us in 2nd Corinthians Chapter 9 Verses 6 and 7. God commands us to show love to one another because we cannot claim to love Him, whom we have never seen, when we do not love fellow human beings whom we see (Ist John Chapter 4 Verse 20). This demonstration of solidarity with the human family has to do start with our relationship with the less privileged members of society. “It is incumbent on all Ndi Anambra and, indeed, all Nigerians to work towards a more humane society. Building a more caring society is a practical way of serving both our God and the human race.God bless Anambra State, the Light of the Nation.”

In view of his plea, prosecution counsel, J.N. Dogoyaro prayed the court to fix a date for the commencement of trial and for the defendant to be remanded in prison custody. However, counsel to the defendant, J.C. Okere reminded the judge of the defendant’s bail application already before the court. Justice Mohammed consequently granted the defendant bail in the sum of N1, 000,000 (One Million Naira)and two reliable sureties in like sum. One of the sureties must be a senior member of the defendant’s family while the other surety must be a civil servant not lower than Grade Level 13. Wilson ran into trouble when the operatives of the Nigeria Police Force arrested him along Ozuoba by N.T.A Road, Port Harcourt, sometime in June, 2019 on alleged fraudulent activities, ranging from love and internet scams and other related offences. His arraignment followed the Commission’s investigations which established prima facie case of fraud against him.

Police in south China’s Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have arrested 31 persons suspected of organising and leading a pyramid scheme involving more than 250 million yuan (around 36 million U.S. dollars). The arrest was disclosed by local authorities on Wednesday. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Police in Pubei County discovered that many local people had participated in an online shopping platform since late June, which lured its members to sell self claimed health promoting products for considerable profits. An investigation led to a suspected pyramid scheme platform that has over 8,000 members across the country. The Police had launched raids in several provinces on July 23 that led to the arrests. Police also froze over 92 accounts worth 21 million yuan and seized seven vehicles and 46 computers. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that in a pyramid scheme, an organisation compels individuals who wish to join to make a payment. In exchange, the organisation promises its new members a share of the money taken from every additional member that they recruit. The directors of the organisation (those at the top of the pyramid) also receive a share of these payments. For the directors, the scheme is potentially lucrative – whether or not they do any work, the organisation’s membership has a strong incentive to continue recruiting and funneling money to the top of the pyramid. As recruiting multiplies, recruiting becomes quickly impossible, and most members are unable to profit; as such, pyramid schemes are unsustainable and often illegal.

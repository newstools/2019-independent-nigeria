Unai Emery has suggested that Nicolas Pepe could be involved when Arsenal face Newcastle United in their opening game of the new Premier League season on Sunday. The Gunners travel to face Steve Bruce’s side at St James’ Park on Sunday as they kick off the 2019/20 campaign in the north east. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network But whether or not the club’s record signing will be involved has become a question for Emery, after Pepe was not involved for Arsenal in their final pre-season friendly against Barcelona last night (Sunday). The Gunners said that the Ivory Coast international, together with Alex Iwobi and Mohamed Elneny, had been given extra time after their exploits at the African Cup of Nations, meaning that Pepe won’t have played a game for his new side prior to the first Premier League game on Sunday. As such, Emery has been asked whether he will feature against the Magpies, with the Gunners’ head coach pleading for patience with the £72million signing after the game at the Nou Camp last night.

“Tomorrow, we are going to train together,” Emery said, speaking after the 2-1 defeat against Barcelona. “Each day for him [Pepe] and for us is information we can save. We hope he can be [available] for this match. With him, I want to be patient. “He is in the same situation as the other players who have been coming in the last days. For example, Lucas, after one week of training today has his first ten minutes. With Pepe it is the same. It’s better to be training and be working with us.”

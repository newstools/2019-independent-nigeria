The New Life Gospel Church recently blessed outstanding church workers to Show appreciation for their commitment in the vine yard of God. At the event which took place at their Ijegun, Alimosho headquarters Lagos, gifts items such as household items and cash were part of the programme scheduled to honor those who have committed special time in God’s Vine Yard in the last one year. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The financier, and founder of the church, Fidelis Anomneze expressed excitement over the commitment of the recipients and advised them to be more committed in serving God. He said that the money used to get the gift items were not personal money of anyone, but part of the money they had paid as tithe and offerings, as was directed by the Holy Spirit. He encouraged them to serve God in all sincerity and that God never forsakes those that worship him in true spirit. Anomneze narrated how the ministry started about 16 years ago in a room apartment and then progressed to a space in a school from where God brought them to Canaan land. He also added that the concept of building a Church for God was a promise he made to God at a point of need in his life. Asked to comment on the present situation of the church in Nigeria, he said, “the church has always faced challenges from the beginning of the world, and by His special grace, both the church and the children of God have always triumphed.” The resident pastor of the parish, Evangelist Joseph Christian said members have directly reaped from what they had sowed. According to him, rewarding workers is a way of encouraging them to get more committed to the work of God. He also stated that what excites him in the congregation is the love, peace and unity that exist in the church. On the present challenges facing churches in Nigeria, he pointed out that the church needs more prayers now more than ever.

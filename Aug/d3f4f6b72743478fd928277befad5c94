LAGOS – Fatai Owoseni, former Lagos and Benue State Commissioner of Police and Special Adviser to Oyo State Governor onSecurity, has said that Nigerian is the most difficult place to enforce law because everyone is a law breaker and no one is ready to obey the laws of the land. Speaking during a conference on Thursday tagged, “Fighting Corruption and Insecurity, The Way Forward.” Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Owoseni said that government would not solve the problem of insecurity and corruption, but everyone must be involved in the fight. He said that in solving the problem nobody should be given a special entitlement to do that. He said that everything must be done on merit. He challenged women to be part of it and not giving themselves sense of entitlement. He maintained that the elites were the problem of the country, pointing out that when they talk about insecurity, they were the people who even when they were no longer in power could not manage their homes. Owoseni said, “Nigeria is one of the most difficult places to enforce laws. As a police man who was in service for 35 years, I can tell you that. We are all law breakers. If you go to United States of America, there may not be any law enforcement agent standing to monitor the traffic movement but people come there and obey the law but in Nigeria you would see traffic police use his hand to compel the driver to stop, he will still not obey. Everybody in Nigeria is a rich man. You put people in office and you give them N30,000 to do the job and you expect them to function,” he said. He said that the civil society and the media should come out and champion accountability from those in government. “They should call for town hall meetings where the issue of corruption and insecurity must be addressed all the time. Those in leadership positions might not be taken to court but through constant reminding they would know that people understand what their responsibilities should be.”

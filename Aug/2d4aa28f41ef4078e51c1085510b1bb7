Ahead of the Eid-el-Kabir, the Sango-Ota command of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in Ogun has warned motorists against violating the speed limit regulation. Mr Akeem Ganiyu, the Sango-Ota Unit Commander of FRSC, gave the warning in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Sango-Ota on Friday. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network NAN reports that the Federal Government had declared Monday and Tuesday as public holiday to enable Muslim faithful to celebrate the Eld-el-Kabir. Ganiyu said the warning became necessary as excessive speed had been identified as the major cause of accidents that had claimed many lives in the state. He also stressed the need for such caution as there would be high vehicular movement as a result of the festival. “Motorists should obey the speed limit violation and use standard tyres,” he said. Ganiyu also urged motorists to always ensure that their vehicles were in good condition before embarking on any trip to avoid accidents.

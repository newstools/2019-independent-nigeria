ABUJA – The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday took President Muhammadu Buhari presidency to the cleaner, says its stinks, rotten and reeks of incurable corruption, festering up to every level. The party said that the shocking revelations of multi-dimensional sleazes, bribery, stealing and extortion in President Buhari’s Special Investigation Panel for Recovery of Public Property as well as in the office of the Head of Service of the Federation (HOSF) are just a tip of the iceberg of the earthshaking corruption deeply entrenched in the Buhari Presidency. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network PDP, in a statement by its spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan said that Nigerians are aware of how the indicted Chairman of the Special Investigation Panel, Okoi Obono-Obla and the Head of Service, Winifred Oyo-Ita, enjoyed the protection of the cabal in the Buhari Presidency “in its brazen burglary of our common patrimony. “Nigerians can also recall how the PDP had severally raised the issue of humongous fraud going on in the Special Investigation Panel under Obono-Obla as well as the Chairman’s certificate forgery allegation, and how President Buhari condoned him and refused to take immediate action. “The Buhari Presidency should therefore know that Nigerians are not carried away by this new attempt to hoodwink them through the usual holier than thou script. “If President Buhari is indeed serious about exposing corruption, he should immediately allow a system-wide probe into the activities of his administration in the last four years, particularly the trillions of naira sleazes in the Ministry of Petroleum Resources, where he was minister.”

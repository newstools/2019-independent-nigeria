IBADAN – Oyo State chapter of the Nigerian Union of Pensioners (NUP) has revealed that Governor Seyi Makinde would commission its radio station, ‘Pensioners’ Radio’, in September. The union’s secretary, comrade Segun Abatan, disclosed this recently when the management of Oyo State Ministry of Information, Culture and Tourism led by its Permanent Secretary, Dr. Bashir Olanrewaju, paid a visit to the Pensioners’ House at Jericho, Ibadan, to witness the test transmission of the radio station. Abatan said the radio station was the first of its kind in Africa and would focus on broadcast of issues relating to the welfare of pensioners in the state
among other issues that affect generality of people as well as the growth of society. He said the feat was achievable because of the relative peace, financial empowerment and confidence that the new administration of Makinde had restored to workers in Oyo State, stressing that the union built its edifice, the radio station, an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) centre and pensioners’ clinic from the meagre resources that members contributed from their monthly pensions. “Today is another day we shall never forget in the lives of Oyo State pensioners. Despite our meagre earnings, you can see all we have been able to achieve. Even NLC, despite their humongous income has not achieved this.

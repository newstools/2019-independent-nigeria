Turkey’s foreign minister on Saturday highlighted the importance of
the peaceful settlement of the dispute in Libya, according to
Aa.com.tr reports. “[…] international community should display a united and principled
stance to stop the clashes in Libya,” Mevlut Cavusoglu said in a
Twitter message after meeting his Libyan counterpart Mohamed Taher
Siyala in Khartoum, where they gather to attend the signing ceremony
of a power-sharing deal between rival sides in Sudan. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Libya has remained beset by turmoil since 2011, when long-time ruler
Muammar Gaddafi was ousted and killed in a bloody NATO-backed uprising
after four decades in power. The oil-rich country has since seen the emergence of two rival seats
of power: one in eastern Libya, with which military commander Khalifa
Haftar is affiliated, and the Tripoli-based GNA, which enjoys UN
recognition. The signing ceremony of the Constitutional Declaration in Khartoum
covers arrangements concerning the Transitional Civilian Authority,
between the Forces of Freedom and Change and the Transitional Military
Council, according to a statement by the Turkish Foreign Ministry on
Friday. On Aug. 4, Sudan’s ruling Transitional Military Council (TMC) and the
opposition alliance Forces for Freedom and Change (FFC) initialed the
declaration towards a transition to civilian rule following the ouster
of long-serving President Omar al-Bashir. Sudan has been in turmoil since April 11, when the military
establishment announced al-Bashir’s removal after months of popular
protests against his 30-year rule. As part of his visit, Cavusoglu will meet with Sudanese officials and
representatives from some other countries participating in the signing
ceremony.

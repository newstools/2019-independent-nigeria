Manchester United midfielder Fred has sent a positive message to fans as he prepares for another week training with the club. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The Brazil international is yet to feature for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side this season having missed much of the pre-season tour in order to get married. Fred did not feature in any of United’s final three matches of last season either, with his last appearance for the club coming during a 2-0 home loss against Man City in April. Reports over the weekend have linked the 26-year-old with a potential exit from Old Trafford, but Fred remains focused on transforming his fortunes at United. “A blessed week to everyone,” Fred posted on his Instagram story. “Let’s training,” followed by emojis of a football, love heart and praying hands. United have struggled for creativity in the centre of midfield so far this season and speaking earlier in the month Fred remained confident that he can still be a success at the club. “My first season was a bit difficult,” the Brazilian told Inside United. “The first year is always a little bit difficult, a year of adaptation, and, moreover, we had a season that wasn’t too strong in terms of the Premier League. “But now I’m more used to the league and I’ve been working hard. I’ve talked to the manager and backroom staff, and this season is going to be better than last season. I’m sure it is going to be very successful.

Abuja – Chairman of Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF), Kayode Fayemi has stressed the need for state governors to partner with world bank in order for them to improve the quality of life and living conditions of their people. Fayemi stated this on Wednesday in Abuja at a workshop with the world bank to review the bank’s engagement with sub-national states. The Governor said: “It is important that we work with the bank, particularly the country’s director, Rachid Benmessaoud and his team, to look at ways of engaging the bank, subsisting portfolio and review things that we are doing right, things we need to improve on and how we need to accelerate deployment of resources that is available within the portfolio for states” “The bank is spending somewhere in the region of $4 billion in states and some of our states are benefiting from a range of grants, even the loans that we benefit from on the basis of the bank’s investments in our states, these are with long term moratorium and with low interest over a long period of time to offset those loan portfolios” “So it is important for us to work on that engagement both in terms of the lending operations, in terms of adversary activities, in terms of the concrete action in our states. I don’t know of many developments parts that have programmes in 36 states, the world bank does and all of our governors were present in this meeting and that makes the statement about the importance attached to this partnership with the world bank and we had extensive discussion on how to improve on existing relationship and how to build on those projects that have transitioned from one governor to the other.” Fayemi disclosed that the NGF has proposed a range of suggestions which the bank has taken up and will be implementing in other to better the relationship the governors have built over the years. “There is a question of course of also not having enough resources and the need to expand the lending portfolio from what it is now both to the federal government and the sub-national entity” “It is absolutely important that the vehicle is not closed because if we can borrow from the world bank at one percent interest it is always going to be better for us than for us to borrowing at 25 percent commercial lending rate, that is a no brainer, we will all agree with that” “For us it is about development and if you look at some of the programmes  whether you are talking about BESDA – The Better Education Service Delivery for All, in our states which focuses a lot on the northern states, where we have a high percentage of out of school children, or you look at a Saving One Million Lives that deals with malaria and all other diseases that have been responsible for the high rate of child mortality, under-five mortality in many of our states, and these are grants, these are not loans or even which is about FISTA which is about fiscal transparency in our states.” Speaking, World Bank country’s director, Rachid Benmessaoud disclosed that the bank has been particularly engaging with the NGF as an important platform for engaging with the sub-national governments besides its engagements at the state level. “As you know the world bank mission is to fight poverty and build prosperity. We know that the number of poor people has increased in Nigeria in terms of number though the trend is decreasing” “So fighting poverty in Nigeria and Africa is going to be absolutely critical for reducing poverty globally. So, therefore, our priorities which we have engaged with the governors will be around investing in human capital, investing in people to have access to basic education, health services, social protection” “But we do recognize the development challenges also requires investing in infrastructure and filling the large infrastructure gaps. But with that, we want to make sure that those infrastructure gaps are filled by bringing more of the private sector so that will enable to create the physical space for governors to invest in human capital including financing from development partners like the world bank” “But most importantly to increase the domestic revenue mobilization for providing primary spending on the social sector” “So, therefore, the world bank has a large part of its engagement at the state level. So therefore what we have done today in this workshop hosted by the NGF is to go over the portfolio at the state level and to how it can accelerate the implementation of the programmes” “The portfolio ranges from health, education, soil erosion, water and it has a lot of investments that are also performance-based, where the state is rewarded on the basis of performance on a certain indicator” “As the chairman has said, better education, reducing the number of out of school children, the states fiscal performance, providing basic primary healthcare, a range of activities already implemented” “We wanted to make sure that the new governors, as well as the returning governors, are well aware of the programmes being implemented in their respective states and what it will take for them to accelerate the pace of implementation” “We discussed around coordination mechanism, the alignment between projects funded by the world bank and the state development plans” “We discussed ways of ensuring that the funding provided by the world bank are used for the intended purposes, how the governors can engage with the bank, accessed funds in the bank which they can benefit from” “We discussed the way forward and what I really appreciate which I have expressed to the chairman, is that all the governors and Deputy governors present today gave their commitment to really pay attention to the world bank portfolio in their respective states and to ensure that this kind of conversation is done on a regular basis, not only at our level but at their level with their project coordinators, state coordinators to ensure that any issue that affects implementation are being addressed.” “We excited with this new partnership in the sense that this new tram of both the returning and new governors, we have the way forward so that at the end of the day it is not about how much money is being dispersed but how much lives we are willing to collectively transform” “Are we able to bring life and succor to the lives of the much needed poor people in this region, we are to provide healthcare and are we able to provide basic education especially for girls to go to school and to stay in school, are we are able to ensure pregnant woman is able to deliver safely in the hospital. These are the kind of development challenges we have before us.”

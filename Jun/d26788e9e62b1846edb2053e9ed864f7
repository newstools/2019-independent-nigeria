We have to fight for 180 minutes more, plus added time. A game can change in the last minute so we will work very hard for it and I can promise that we’ll never give up,” Dennerby said. Falcons have a mountain to climb to qualify for the next round of the ongoing FIFA Women World Cup in France. They will next face South Korea, who lost 4-0 to France on Friday. Afterwards, they will play the host for a place in the next round. However, Falcons have settled down in Grenoble, ahead of Wednesday’s make-or-break match with Korea Republic. All eyes and mind are now on this game on Wednesday evening. Korea’s 4-0 loss means Nigeria are third in the pool, and being a 24 –team tournament, the African champions will be in good stead to reach the Round of 16 if they brush the Koreans aside on Wednesday and hold France to a stalemate in Rennes on 17th June. They can then hope to be among the four best third-placed teams to advance from the group stage. On Monday, the team trained at the Stade Eugène Thenard on the Avenue du General de Charles Gaulle. Wednesday’s match will start 3pm (same time as in Nigeria), and the two teams have the opportunity of playing their game and knowing where they stand before

Akinwunmi stressed that the NFF has put the right things and conditions in place to make the players comfortable and prime themselves for a heroic outing in Egypt. “We have laid the proper ground for them, and we expect them to do well at the tournament. “Everything they need has been put in place. All they now have to do is to go there and bring the trophy back home,” said Akinwunmi. Meanwhile, some members of the team have started reporting to camp in Asaba, Delta State. Nigeria will be gunning for a fourth title, which they last won in 2013, but then missed the last two editions in 2015 and 2017, and Akinwunmi said the players will have no excuse for failure. Nigeria has been zoned in Group D alongside two debutants in the tournament, Burundi and Madagascar with the Syli Stars of Guinea as the fourth team in the group. The Super Eagles open their campaign in the tournament on June 22 with their first group match against Burundi and then play fellow-West Africa country, Guinea on June 26 before facing Madagascar in the last group match on June 30. Apart from winning the AFCON title in 2013, the Super Eagles were also winners on home soil in 1980 and way in Tunisia in 1994.

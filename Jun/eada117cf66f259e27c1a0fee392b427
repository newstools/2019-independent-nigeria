Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Contrary to speculations in some quarters that the National Working Committee (NWC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC), after wide consultations with President Muhammdu Buhari and other stakeholders of the party, has formally endorsed Senator Ovie Omo-Agege as the party’s candidate for the position of Deputy Senate President in the 9th National Assembly, a leading contender in the race and Senator-elect, Abia North Senatorial Zone, Dr. Uzor Orji-Kalu, has debunked insinuations that he had withdrawn from the contest. Mallam Lanre Onilu, National Publicity Secretary of the party, had on Monday morning issued a statement that the National Working Committee has formally adopted Senator Ovie Omo-Agege as the party’s candidate for the position of Deputy Senate President. Orji-Kalu, who had some days ago met behind closed doors with President Buhari disclosed that the President only adopted the candidacies of the duo of Senator Ahmed Lawan and Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila for the positions of Senate President and Speaker of the House of Representatives, respectively, while noting that anyone is free to contest for other principal positions. In a statement issued by his media office on Monday and signed by Ken Cole, the former governor stressed that as a staunch supporter of President Buhari and a loyal and committed member of the APC, he (Kalu) would always abide by the decisions of the President and highly respected members of the National Working Committee (NWC). He, however, said the speculation of the formal endorsement of Omo-Agege was the handiwork of selfish elements in the party who ware self-serving and desperate to cause disharmony among party stakeholders.

Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The President/Chief Executive of Dangote Industries Limited, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, has called for a law promoting gender equality in the country. Speaking at the 2019 Women Corporate Directors Lecture sponsored by Aliko Dangote Foundation, Dangote advocated for a legislative backing that will allow a certain percentage of women in public or private sectors’ work force. He stated that “We can start with a proportion of like 30 women to 70 men on the board.” He noted that increasing the number of women in corporate world leads to increase in innovation and innovative thinking, which opens up the door of fresh perceptive, saying that women on board of directors reduce governance related issues and ultimately results to a better performance. According to Dangote, from my businesses as well, my three daughters all take on challenging roles as senior executives at the group level and I can tell you that they have led the businesses to success. “We have a strong number of women at Dangote Industries across board, a lot of women occupy important leadership positions and their efficiencies have been noticed.” He added that with the caliber of women at this event, ranging from board executives of various organisation, business executives and top government executives, it is a clear indication that women in the workforce have started taking their rightful place in the private, public and social sector in Nigeria and across Africa. He, however, said despite this impressive achievement there is still a lot of work to be done to close the gender gap in the world work place. Nigeria women, according to Dangote, are climbing the corporate ladder and we have a good number of them as chief executive officers of top firms, members of board of directors, chairmen or chairpersons of boards of companies in the like of former Minister of Finance, Nike Akande; chairman of First Bank of Nigeria, Ibukunoluwa Awosika; chairman of Access Bank, Mosunmola Belo-Olusoga; chairman of Guaranty Trust Bank, Osaretin Demuren, to mention a few.

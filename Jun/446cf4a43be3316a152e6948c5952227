The match is scheduled to take place at the 18,000–capacity Stadion Widzewa by 7:30 pm Nigerian time. The same stadium will host the final on June 15. The Flying Eagles have not been particularly impressive after opening their competition with a 4-0 thumping of Qatar. They lost 2-0 to USA and only drew 1-1 with the Ukraine in their last group game, thus qualifying as one of the best third placed teams. On their own, Senegal qualified as Group A leaders with seven points. They defeated Tahiti 3-0 in their opening match, before sealing a second round ticket with a hard fought 2-0 victory over Colombia. In their last game, they drew blank with the hosts. Meanwhile, Coach Paul Aigbogun has said that they would not fear Senegal in this game, admitting that the Flying Eagles must be in their best element to beat the West Africans. “It’s Africa to Africa. They are a good team so we’ll show them respect in that aspect but we won’t fear them,” the former Enyimba head coach said. “I’m sure they’ll look at us too, we know each other from the previous tournament and watching them play, but we know that we have to be at our best because they are a good team and any teams we meet now in the tournament is going to be a tough opposition,” he added.

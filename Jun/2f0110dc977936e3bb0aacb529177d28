AWKA – Victor Umeh of Anambra Central Senatorial District has urged the 9th National Assembly to begin where the 8th stopped by giving all Nigerians a sense of belonging. Umeh in an interview with DAILY INDEPENDENT in Awka yesterday, said the Assembly can do this by amending the constitution, ensuring that appointments reflect federal character and that no religion is made to look superior or more important than the other. He said he emphasized this point because soon nominations of ministers and service chiefs will come from the President to the National Assembly to confirm or reject. Umeh reflected on this: “Remember that last year I opposed nomination for the board of Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) because the South East and South-South were not reflected in it. “It was sent back to the President and he promised to bring the list back to reflect that. I expect that the list will come back in the 9th Assembly. So, they must watch out for it,” he said. Umeh also advised the Assembly to uphold the secularity of the nation that allowed for freedom of worship. He said that what happened last year when a group of people referred to as herdsmen went into a Catholic Church in Benue State, killed two priests, a catechist and 17 worshippers, should not be allowed to happen again. According to him, should Catholics go into a mosque and kill people in retaliation, that would have resulted in a war.

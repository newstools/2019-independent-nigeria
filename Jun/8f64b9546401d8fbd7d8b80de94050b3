Reports have it that he was released without charge, according to reports. Ahmad who was in France for the 69th FIFA Congress on Wednesday and had also presided over an Emergency Committee meeting of CAF was arrested in his hotel room on Thursday. But his passport has now been handed to him, meaning he is free to travel, a section of reports said. The 58-year-old football administrator was initially detained by the Central Office for the Fight against Corruption and Financial and Tax Offences (Oclif). FIFA confirmed the French probe and said it had requested more information. CAF itself has yet to officially comment on the issue. The probe in question was over a contract that CAF terminated with German equipment manufacturer Puma in favor of Technical Steel. Ahmad is accused of having influenced this decision, standing to be rewarded with up to $830,000. He has denied the allegations. ‘‘All decisions were taken in a collective and transparent manner,” Ahmad said in mid-April. The CAF President is expected to watch Friday’s opening match at the Women’s World Cup. He will subsequently leave for Egypt ahead of the African Cup of Nations, AFCON, starting on June 21.

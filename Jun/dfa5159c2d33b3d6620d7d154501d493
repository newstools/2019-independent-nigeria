Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Temidayo Akinsuyi Lagos – Prof. Itse Sagay (SAN), Chairman of the Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption  (PACAC) on Tuesday said he is confident that the 2015 coup plot that took place in the National Assembly will not repeat itself again today when the 9th Assembly elects its leadership. Speaking in a chat with Daily Independent, Sagay said that  Senator Ahmad Lawan and Femi Gbajabiamila will be elected as Senate President and Speaker of the House of Representatives respectively. According to him, the endorsement of Senator Ali Ndume and Umar Bago by the opposition Peoples Democratic Party  (PDP) will amount to nothing. “No. I don’t think what happened in 2015 will repeat itself. In 2015,  the APC was totally disorganised. In fact, on their way to the meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari, that was when the election took place in the Senate”. “So, with that bad experience behind, they are prepared very well for today’s election”. “They are united and so whoever the PDP nominates will make no difference this time because some members of the PDP who will even join in electing APC nominees today,” he said.

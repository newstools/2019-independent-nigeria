The monarch made the appeal while addressing representatives of the Iludun landlords association and other residents of the area who visited his palace in protest of insinuation that some land grabbers had invaded the community to forcefully take over their land. He noted that there was no land grabber in the community, but the federal government through the Transmission Company of Nigeria needs the land for the benefit of the state and Nigeria in general. He said the company is planning to construct a $200m power transmission project in five different locations in the state, including Ejio, adding that the project when completed, will address the inadequacy of the electricity transmission capacity of the country. He added that the project will also increase available power to industrial concerns and the populace. Oba Ogunmuyiwa said that land acquired in the community will be used for building sub stations that will help to expand the nation’s transmission capacity. Assuring his people of adequate compensation by the federal government, the traditional ruler added that compensation will be paid to individual landlords in the community, stressing that government will not pay anybody by proxy.

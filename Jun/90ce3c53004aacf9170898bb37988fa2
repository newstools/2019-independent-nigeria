Adagunodo called on the governor to focus on sustainable tourism to further boost the chances of Lagos becoming the 21st-century economy, take the Nigerian tourism industry to the next level and ensure that the sector contributes more to the state’s Gross Domestic Product. She stated this in a statement made available to Daily Independent, adding, “Like the previous Lagos administration, I am happy that the new government featured tourism as one of its developmental agenda. As the government is settling down to work, I encourage the administration to concentrate on Sustainable Tourism. “This is because the next phase of tourism is for it to become sustainable, and for Lagos to establish a robust tourism industry, it requires a roadmap that takes full account of tourism’s current and future economic, social and environmental impacts, addressing the needs of visitors, the industry, the environment and host communities. “In fact, a combined report by the United Nations World Tourism Organisation, International Trade Centre and Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF) reveal that tourism (sustainable) is widely recognised as a key sector for achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), given its major potential to contribute to jobs and wealth creation in the developing world. Tourism is estimated to represent 10% of global GDP and generates directly or indirectly one in ten jobs globally.”

Bureau Chief Benin – Hon. Sylvester Okoro, Chairman of Orhionmwon Local Government Council of Edo State has presented a budget estimate of N2,580,915,932.46 for the 2019 fiscal year to the legislative arm of Council. The financial plan christened ‘Budget of reality’ was N200,000,000.00 higher than that of 2018. Okoro said the sum of N2.1bn was proposed for recurrent expenditure while capital expenditure would gulp N431m. He stated that the proposed projects in the 2018 budgets could not be attended to in the manner desired due to short-fall in the revenue expectation. Some of the key projects for execution in 2019 fiscal year, he said, include constructions of blocks of three class rooms with headmaster’s office in selected primary schools, construction of blocks of open and lock-up stalls in selected communities. Others are payment of counter-part fund for Community Social Development Programme (CSDP) projects, Construction of Oil Palm Mill and re-activation of reconstruction of Abattoir amongst others.

Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Awka – The Federal Government will soon open the portal for N-Power employment this year. The programme is said to be one of the poverty reduction initiatives of President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration. Disclosing the Federal Government’s intention to commence N-Power programme this year during a youth development seminar organised by JohnBosco Onunkwo Foundation held in Awka, Anambra State, at the weekend, the state chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Basil Ejidike, said the Federal Government will in no distant time begin massive job recruitments for the teeming population of unemployed Nigerians through the N-Power job creation initiative. He, therefore, enjoined all APC members in Anambra State to avail themselves of the opportunity provided by the Federal Government, adding that N-Power jobs can only be accessed through the official portal that would be opened to the public soon. He stressed that forms were being filled online as interested applicants should access information on the N-Power scheme through the official Federal Government portal on the internet. Ejidike emphasized that 80 percent of those who did proper online registration stand the chances of getting the jobs through the state APC party secretariat in the state. He, therefore, disclosed further that the state chapter of the APC had already secured a concession from the Presidency such that Anambra has been granted about 7,000 slots from N-Power jobs this year. He also pointed out that out of the 7,000 slots, about 2,000 may be given to the Anambra State chapter of the Good Governance Ambassadors of Nigeria headed by Onunkwo, also an APC stalwart in the state.

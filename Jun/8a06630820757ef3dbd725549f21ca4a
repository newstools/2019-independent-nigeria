Osogbo – Worried by the increase in the spate of kidnapping, banditry and killing in the state, members of Osun State House of Assembly have initiated a bill prohibiting kidnapping, banditry and other social criminalities in the state.
The state lawmakers, through the new bill, tagged: “State Of Osun Kidnapping (Prohibition Bill), 2019,” recommended life imprisonment for perpetrators of the dastardly act.
The Bill was sponsored by the newly inaugurated Speaker, Timothy Owoeye, was presented to the Assembly at the plenary session on Wednesday.
The Bill will, among other things, reduce the likelihood of occurrence of kidnap incidents in the state, proffer appropriate sanctions on anyone found engaging in or aiding and abetting kidnap activities, deter anyone contemplating of engaging or related action and further guarantee peace and security among residents and visitors to Osun State.
The Bill, if passed to the law, would jettison the current state law, chapter 31, No. 364 under offenses against liberty; Slave dealing, which recommends 10 years’ imprisonment for anyone found guilty.
While briefing his colleagues on the Bill, Owoeye said the importance of the Bill is to seriously check the spate of kidnapping in the state and make the state a safe haven for all and sundry.
The motion for the first reading of the Bill was moved by the House Majority Leader, Maruf Olanrewaju, representing Irewole/Isokan State Constituency and seconded by Babatunde Festus, representing Atakumosa West and East State Constituency.
Owoeye thanked his colleagues for their support and cooperation.
He expressed optimism that with the love being exhibited by honourable members, the Parliament would take the state to enviable height.
The House later adjourned till July 9, 2019.

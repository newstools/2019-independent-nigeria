Izilein believes his failure to improve on himself due to indiscipline discipline was responsible for him being dropped. Though, he described Iheanacho’s change infortunes as unfortunate, but added that he lacks the discipline expected of Premier league player.” “After getting so much attention from some of the top clubs in the Premier League as Manchester City and his present club, Iheanacho assumed that he was a big boy; that is the beginning of indiscipline in a player and he became so unserious. “Unfortunately, he was not even able to command a first team shirt in either of the clubs – Manchester City and Leicester City; things are even worst for him in the present club,” Izilein emphasised. “Iheanacho is still a very young boy with many years ahead; he should learn from his mistakes now and use this opportunity to improve his game so he can return to a good form that we used to know him.” He did not spare the Falcons describing their performance in the ongoing FIFA Women’s World Cup as disappointing; saying the 3-0 loss to Norway was a “woeful start”. “Falcons performance was a bad way to begin a competition; Falcons are African champions – much is expected from them.” “I have always been saying that the football authorities should disband this present Super Falcons; a good number of the players are just too old to remain in the team; the likes of Oshoala; Okparanozie should be retired; we need fresh blood in the team, not mothers.” Going forward Izilein said, “In women football, age 25 and above are too old because of the nature of woman,” hence he reiterated the need for Nigerian women league to be upgraded for the best players to be fished out.

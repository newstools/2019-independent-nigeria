Powered by RubiQube Ad Network MINNA – Country Director, Mamaye, a Civil Society Organisation (CSO), Dr. Tunde Segun, has urged civil society groups to encourage all tiers of government to provide social amenities by reporting some well-thought-out policies and programmes that have direct bearing on the collective well-being of Nigerians. He said with the report, governments will be encouraged to do more. Segun, who made the declaration shortly after the Agenda for PHC Advocacy Learning Dissemination meeting in Minna Niger State on Monday, said that available records showed that government gets easily discouraged when reports of non-performance dominate media organizations, especially in the area of provision of basic health facilities for citizens, particularly in parts of northern states. Segun applauded CSOs in Niger State for championing the cause of women and girl-child in advocating for better-equipped and affordable basic healthcare delivery system in rural areas, especially the ‘hard-to-reach’ areas to guarantee safety of mother and child. Efforts of the CSOs, he said, yielded desired results as Niger is rated second after Gombe State in effective advocacies for Primary Health Care Under One Roof, (PHCUOR) mainstreaming and networking that saw to the successful implementation of the nine throng approach to the proper funding and management of basic healthcare delivery system for citizens. If journalists will focus on writing special reports on achievements by individual administrations in primary health care delivery, there is every possibility that the government in question will be encouraged to do more the Mamaye Country Director pointed out. Recent survey and statistics by relevant monitoring and supervision, data collection for the 2018/2019 fiscal year, he said, indicates that Niger State came second out 36 states and the FCT Abuja, where advocacies for better primary health care delivery system by their Primary Health Care State Advocacy Team, (PHCSAT) have led to proper constitution of boards for Primary Health Care Development Agencies (PHCDAs). The Director, Niger State Primary Health Care Delivery Agency (NSPHCDA), Ndanusa Baba Ndako, enumerated the benefits of collaboration with CSO coalitions for PHCUOR implementation to include: governance and ownership, legislation, minimum package.

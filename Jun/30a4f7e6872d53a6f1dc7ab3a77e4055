Syrian state media said militants shelled government-held areas causing material damage. The Observatory said that Saturday’s fighting alone left 26 troops and pro-government gunmen dead as well as eight militants. Six weeks of violence has driven nearly 300,000 people from their homes. Many are living under olive trees, in tents or unfinished buildings, crammed into overcrowded shared rooms. More than 300 civilians have been killed since fighting broke out on April 30.

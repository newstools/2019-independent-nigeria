According to him, “Is too early to know what we met. I just started work on Thursday and we are just studying the handover note. I also just started meeting with different people within just 24 hours. We have done a lot of work; we have met with most of the agencies. “We met with all permanent secretaries in order to brief us, we asked for different information from where they are, we met with some of chairmen of local government areas to know how they are. “We also met with security agencies to know whether there is security in this state, so as to improve on the security measure in the state and so that people can live in peace with one another. These are some of things we have been doing since we assumed duty,” he said.

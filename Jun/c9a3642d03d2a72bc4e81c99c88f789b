GOMBE – The committee constituted by the Gombe State Governor, Mohammed Inuwa Yahaya, for the distribution of fertilizer in the state has assured that the new administration in the State will not condone late distribution of fertiliser hence forth. The Chairman of the Committee, Mr. Binus Laban Maina, stated this during a pre-distribution briefing Friday afternoon at the headquarters of the State Ministry of Agriculture. He said contrary to the previous years where fertiliser arrive very late and subsequently distributed almost at the end of the farming season in August, the new administration has vowed to discontinue with the trend which had deprived farmers of the needed input for their farms. The Chairman also assured that the committee has already taken measures that will check sharp practices by any members of the public or shylock businessmen who buy the product and take to the open market where it is sold at exorbitant prizes. Mr. Binus said this year’s distribution will be done differently with a truck each going to all the 114 electoral wards of the State and then distributed from all polling units of the state. According to him, “strategies have already been put in place by the committee to ensure a hitch free distribution and I can assure you that culprits found engaged in sharp practices will be apprehended by security agents who are also members of the committee.” On the price of the fertiliser to be sold to farmers and number expected for the State, Mr. Binus said that will be disclosed by the Governor during the flag-off of the fertiliser distribution tomorrow, adding that the product is already in all the headquarters of the 11 Local Government Areas of the State.

A socio-political organisation in Delta state, Urhobo Initiative for Good Governance has appealed to the state governor, Ifeanyi Okowa to consider Chief Sunny Onuesoke, a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for greater responsibilities in his cabinet. In a statement made available to Daily Independent signed by Eseoghene Misan, the group said Onuesoke, a former governorship aspirant of the state deserves more responsibilities in Governor Okowa’s cabinet having performed creditably well in his role as Special Projects Director, Governors Office, Asaba in the last administration. It also said Onuesoke used his position to impact positively on the lives of residents in his community and the state through his foundation. He added despite his busy schedule, Onuesoke also devoted his time, energy and resources in promoting the works and defending the Okowa administration in the media especially during the governorship election when the opposition All Progressives Congress (APC) threatened to win the state by any means necessary. “ The Bible says that ‘He who is faithful in a very little thing is faithful also in much’. That statement aptly fits our son, Chief Sunny Onuesoke who has been one of the dedicated supporters of the Okowa administration. We are appealing to the governor to consider him for more responsibilities in his cabinet”. “Governor Okowa needs brilliant minds who share his visions and dreams for a SMART Delta state. People who will assist him in consolidating on the achievements he recorded in his first term. Tested and trusted individuals who can help articulate his policies to the good people of Delta, Nigeria and the world at large”. “This is what Onuesoke has been doing in the last four years and he will do more if given a higher responsibility by the government” he said.

He words: “Emeka is one of the officers  working on a report on a corruption case to be sent to the headquarters in Benin. “As he was about going to deliver the report, his boss called him back, insisting he shouldn’t go, but he refused. “His boss dragged him with his phone while another officer joined him. He was struggling with them over the phone when they strangled him to death.” It was learnt that the case had been lodged at the Police Area command, while the Unit Commander and his accomplice had been arrested. The FRSC Public Relations Officer in the state, Pascal Anigbo, confirmed the incident but could not give details. He said :”The incident happened around 7pm in the office but I don’t have the full details of the incident now”.

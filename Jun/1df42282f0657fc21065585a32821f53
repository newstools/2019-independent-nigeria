Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Super Eagles have won the Africa Cup of Nations thrice. They won it first as host in 1980, repeated the feat in 1994 in Tunisia before their third win in South Africa in 2013. The team was so super in performance in 1994 that they were ranked fifth by FIFA in April, their highest rankings till date. Throughout history, the team has qualified for six of the last seven FIFA World Cups (as of 2018), missing only the 2006 World Cup hosted in Germany, and have reached the round of 16 three times. Their first World Cup appearance was the 1994 edition hosted by the USA. For the Africa Cup of Nations this is Nigeria’s 18th appearance and has been grouped alongside Guinea, Madagascar and Burundi. Since winning the tournament in 2013, this is the first time they will return to the tournament having failed to qualify for the 2015 and 2017 editions. And they will need to make a statement in a bid to announce their return. However, Coach Gernot Rohr and his players have been putting up finishing touches to their preparations and as part of their preparations they will play another AFCON bound team Senegal in a test game today. Today’s friendly will be an opportunity for the coach to truly assess the team, since they will have to step up their game if they must progress to the next round as there are no more minnows in African football. There are three star players from other group B teams the Super Eagles must watch out for. The first is Arohasina Andrianarimanana, an attacking midfielder who currently plays for South African side, Kaizer Chiefs. He played a key role in his Madagascar’s maiden qualification. The 28-year-old was named in the 2018 COSAFA Cup player of the tournament following his impressive performance. The second is Fiston Abdoul Razak. The Burundi striker plays for Algerian topflight league side, JS Kabylie and has scored seven goals in 21 appearances in the 2018-19 season. The 25-year-old has scored 17 goals in 37 matches since his debut for the national team in 2018. Before moving to the north African country, Razak fired his former club, Al-Zawraa to win the Iraqi Premier League title at the end of 2017–18 season. And the last but not the least is Naby Keita. The Guinea and Liverpool midfielder had an exciting 2018-19 season after playing a crucial role in the Reds’ UEFA Champions League triumph. The 24-year-old scored three goals and one assist after 32 matches in all competitions during the out-gone season. And his presence will give his Guinean colleagues a boost, but more importantly, Nigeria must be wary of the midfielder.

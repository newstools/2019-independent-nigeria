Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Expectedly, Nigeria Flying Eagles exited the ongoing FIFA U-20 World Cup in Poland on Monday following their 2-1 loss to Senegal in their Round of 16 tie. Flying Eagles, who qualified for the knockout as one of the four third best teams, did not improve on their group games performance as their game was characterized by poor marking, poor passing, poor ball control and worst of all poor marksmanship. The first goal opportunity of the game came the way of Nigeria in the 11th minute but Muhamed Tijani headed the ball over the bar. In the 35th minute, a Nigeria counterattack saw Collins Sor, who came in for Maxwell Effiom, with only Senegal goalkeeper-Dialy N’Diaye- at his mercy but hit the goalkeeper with the ball. Immediately, Nigeria paid dearly for that great miss as Amadou Sagna makes mincemeat of Nigeria defence, brushes aside Muhammad Rabiu with his speed and slots past helpless Olawale Oremade for their first goal. Flying Eagles lost another chance of equalizing the game on 44th minute as they filtered away a free kick at edge of the penalty box. Senegal took advantage of Nigeria’s floppy defending as they doubled their lead. Alpha Diounkou find space in the left hand side of Nigeria’s defence, crosses into the defence and Ibrahima Niane scores with the easiest of tapping in. Flying Eagles reduced the tally 10 minutes after restart. Aniekeme Okon deflected in Success Makanjuola’s freekick. All efforts at equalizing failed. In other games Ukraine beat Panama 4-1 while Ecuador beat Uruguay 3-1 to reach the quarterfinals.

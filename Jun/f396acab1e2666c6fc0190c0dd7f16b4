Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Osogbo – Osun State Chairman of All Progressives Congress(APC), Gboyega Famodun, has enjoined members of the party and the public at large not to be despair over the Thursday’s Court of Appeal judgment that gave victory to the Peoples Democratic Party’s (PDP) governorship candidate, Senator Ademola Adeleke, on his eligibility to contest. Famodun, in a statement issued by his Media Consultant, Kola Olabisi, in Osogbo, yesterday said the development was a beauty of democracy. Famodun, who disclosed that his party was not a desperado in the game of political democracy noted that if the judgment had gone the other way, the PDP would have been crying to roof top that the judgment was purchased by the APC. He appealed to the leadership of the PDP to learn the fact that in a game of contest, one doesn’t have to win all the time. Famodun implored the PDP leadership and members to know how to comport themselves with decorum when litigation success comes the way of the APC in the ongoing governorship tussle in the state. He said, it is not unlikely to hear from the PDP, saying ‘democracy is the last hope of a common man’ each time success comes its way but lampooning the same judiciary whenever it doesn’t favour them. Famodun, who said the political development, should not be a source of sleepless night to the APC members and supporters disclosed that the Court of Appeal judgment on Adeleke’s eligibility suit is only a temporary relief for the PDP. In his words: “What I am yet to understand about this set of PDP people is that each time judgment is not on their side, they castigate the judiciary with reckless abandon and a speed of thunder. “But when they have judgment in their favour, you will see them pouring accolades on the judiciary, forgetting that in the contest of life, you win some and lose some.”

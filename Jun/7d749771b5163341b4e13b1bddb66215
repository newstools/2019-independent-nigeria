Powered by RubiQube Ad Network ADO-EKITI – A Senator-elect in Ekiti State and chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Opeyemi Bamidele, has appealed to Muslims to continue to exhibit those characters that would stabilise the nation and mend all ethno-religious cracks affecting the country’s foundation. Bamidele, in his congratulatory message to Muslims on Tuesday, commemorating the end of Ramadan, urged Muslim adherents to continue to put the lessons of Ramadan to practice, by coexisting peacefully with their Christian brothers. The APC chieftain said the acts of piety and puritanism preached during Ramadan were required at this time to bring the country out of pervasive corruption wrecking the economic survival of the nation. “The lessons of Ramadan are love, sacrifice, giving and holiness; these must continue to radiate in our daily lives as Muslims for Nigeria to attain the desired greatness”. Bamidele said the country will continue to soar higher if the holiness exhibited during Ramadan period can continue. The former federal lawmaker appealed to Muslims to work assiduously for the unity of the nation by preaching against extremism and those things that could threaten national unity and development.

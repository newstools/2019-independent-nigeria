Also dropped from the list is Semi Ajayi. Francis Uzoho, Ikechukwu Ezenwa and Daniel Akpeyi are on the radar. This is even as Ola Aina, Shehu Abdullahi, Chigozie Awaziem, William Troost-Ekong, Leon Balogun, Kenneth Omeruo and Jamilu Collins will hold the defence. In the midfield, Captain John Mikel Obi and Wilfred Ndidi as well as Oghenekaro Etebo and John Ogu were selected. For the point-men, those who will travel to Egypt include are Ahmed Musa, Victor Osimhen, Moses Simon and Henry Onyekuru. Others are Odion Ighalo, Alex Iwobi, Samule Kalu, Paul Onuachu and Samuel Chukwueze. Meanwhile, the former youth international, observer had noted, might have been dropped due to his poor form at his club where he has struggled to tie down a playing time, necessitating some people to even question his inclusion in the preliminary list in the first place. Speaking to our correspondent on the list, Henry Nwosu, former Super Eagles captain, said that no coach would drop his game changers, blaming Iheanacho’s form for his delayed AFCON debut. “I don’t think Rohr would drop him if his form is good. Obviously his form is poor and that is why he is dropped because no coach will leave out his best in final selection,” he said. The Super Eagles departed Nigeria for Ismaila, Egypt on Sunday afternoon, for the final phase of their camping ahead of the commencement of the tournament

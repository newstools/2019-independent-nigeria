Super Eagles midfielder, John Ogu, believes playing as an underdog in the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt is a blessing in disguise.
Nigeria failed to qualify for the last two editions of the Nations Cup, despite winning it in South Africa in 2013.
Ogu, who is having Nations Cup baptism believes, the atmosphere of not being favourites was benefiting the team.
“We believe in ourselves, we know ourselves and it is good that we are underdogs,” he told Goal.
“Remember that we are the first team to qualify for the Round of 16, so we will take each game as they come.
“The unity in the team is second to none and all of us are looking forward to that day when we play in this year’s final to the surprise of many.”
Having missed the games against Burundi and Guinea owing to ill-health, he is in line to play against Madagascar today, noting that they want to top the group.
“Our next game is against Madagascar which is what I’m looking up to and I’m very set to play my own part.
“The game is very important to us because we want to put smiles on the face of Nigerians. Though we have qualified for the next round, we don’t want to stop winning.”

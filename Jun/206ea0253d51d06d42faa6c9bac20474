Mikel insisted that his return to international football was in accord with the discussion he had with coach Gernot Rohr, in which they agreed that he would only come back when he feels he is ready to give his very best again. “I am still very much motivated and if I am not I won’t have come to the camp,” he told the media after Saturday’s match in Asaba. “I told the coach that I would return to the Super Eagles when I am ready. I will come back and when I come back I will be able to give 100 percent. “The team has been fantastic until now because of the way they have been playing and I have come to offer my experience and to help the team so that we can have a good tournament”, he said. He added that he and other experienced members of the national team will continue to keep the youngsters in the squad under their proverbial wings. “The Super Eagles camp is a good learning ground for the players that are here. “With the absence of [Wilfred] Ndidi, [Abdullahi] Shehu and others it is also good that we have flashes of talented players that were able to prove their worth.”

Powered by RubiQube Ad Network LAGOS – West African Boxing Union (WABU) lightweight champion, Rilwan Oladosu, and his African Boxing Union (ABU) counterpart, Oto Joseph, are set for epic battles at the GOtv Boxing Night 19 in Lagos on July 14. Both boxers were present at the press conference to announce GOtv Boxing Night 19, at which they are both billed to feature against different opponents on 14 July at the Indoor Sports Hall of Lagos’ National Stadium. Sparks flew as boxers and their opponents were introduced by the organisers, but the event suddenly turned fiery when it got to the turn of Rilwan and his next opponent, Hammed Ganiyu. The latter boasted that he will defeat Rilwan, who responded by describing him as ‘chicken’ and way below his grade in the sport. He followed it up, shouting loudly, with an open challenge to Joe Boy. The ABU champion leapt off his seat to meet his Real One and they had to be pulled apart. Rilwan yelled that he wants to dethrone Joe Boy, a wish he had twice previously expressed at the press conference to announce GOtv Boxing Night 18 and during the event in Ibadan, when he jumped on the ring to taunt Joe Boy as an expired boxer. Both boxers are rated as the best in the Nigeria’s lightweight division, a situation that has bred the wish among fans to see them take on each other.

Powered by RubiQube Ad Network He’s a player we all have to get used to calling “The New Cristiano Ronaldo,” and he’s going to be a regular fixture in Transfer Talk throughout the summer, according to Espn.co.uk reports. “Yes, it’s Benfica sensation Joao Felix, who scored 20 goals in 43 appearances last season and has earned a first senior international call-up for this week’s UEFA Nations League finals in Portugal. Felix, 19, is being courted by just about every top European club after an outstanding breakthrough season, and the Daily Mirror reports that Manchester City and Manchester United are going head-to-head for his signature. The Mirror says that scouts of both clubs will be in Portugal for the Nations League, as his side take on Switzerland in the first semifinal, but with Real Madrid already seeing an offer of £80m turned down it could be that the successful club will need to dig deep and find £120m. The forward has a release clause of €120m, but Benfica are evidently prepared to let him depart for slightly less. Juventus are also in the mix and keen to pair him with what we can only call ‘The Original Cristiano Ronaldo.”

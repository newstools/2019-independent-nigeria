At a friendly game at The Hive in London in March 2017 (the most recent of the 21 encounters between the two nations), both teams settled for a 1-1 draw, with Moussa Sow putting the Lions ahead nine minutes into the second half before Kelechi Iheanacho tied the game from the penalty spot with only nine minutes to go. Nigeria are up against Burundi’s Itamba Ru Mugamba, Guinea’s Syli Nationale and Madagascar’s Barea in Group B of the 32nd Africa Cup of Nations, with Alexandria as venue. Meanwhile, Ola Aina has promised to justify his inclusion in the squad. Aina will make his AFCON debut along with 19 other debutants. “I am happy, I am happy, that’s all I can say. It’s long time coming and I must live up to expectations in order to justify my inclusion in the squad,” said the defender who was dropped from the Super Eagles squad to last year’s FIFA World Cup in Russia. Gernot Rohr, Super Eagles coach released his final list of 23-man list on Saturday with Aina one of the defenders picked, while the coach dropped Kelechi Iheanacho and Semi Ajayi. Aina plays as a wing-back for Serie A club Torino, on loan from Chelsea of the English Premier League (EPL).

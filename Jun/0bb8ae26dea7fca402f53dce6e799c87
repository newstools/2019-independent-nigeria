In a chat with DAILY INDEPENDENT aftermath of the unveiling of the 23-man squad of the team for the AFCON, Taiwo said that the players must be at their very best if they want to achieve their set goal for the tournament. “There are no big names any longer in football. Football is no respecter of any team as they are all equal once the tournament kicks off. “The best team in any tournament is the team that can hold itself well and play well with the sole aim of winning. “Our Super Eagles should be prepared to be such a team in Egypt. Even, the debutants can pull surprises,” said Taiwo. He back up his views with the outcome of Saturday’s international friendly match between the team and the Warriors of Zimbabwe in Asab

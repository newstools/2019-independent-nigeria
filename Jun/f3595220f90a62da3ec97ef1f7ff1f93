President Trump on Wednesday said he’s sticking with Vice President Mike Pence as his 2020 running mate, ruling out dumping him for former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, According to Nypost.com. “I love Nikki. She’s endorsed me. She’s my friend. She’s a part of my campaign. But Mike has been a great vice president. He’s a hundred percent,” Trump told Mario Bartiromo during an interview on Fox Business. She asked the president about an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal this week urging Trump to add Haley to the ticket in an effort to attract “politically moderate suburban women.” Trump said “Nikki’s future is good” but Pence is “the person, 100 percent.” “We won together. We have tremendous evangelical support. We have tremendous support from every angle. You can’t break up a team like that. And we get along well together,” he said.

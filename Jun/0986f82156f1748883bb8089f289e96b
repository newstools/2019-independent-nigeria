Abdulrahman Bashir and Stanley Dimgba scored in the 39, 40 and 66 minutes to hand Enyimba the vital win, even as Samuel Mathias reduced the deficit in the 45th minute for Lobi. Enyimba now have six points, while Lobi have four points. Meanwhile, in the early kickoff, Kano Pillars continued their impressive form with a 2-1 win over IfeanyiUbah, who are obviously eliminated from the race for the league title. Rabiu Ali scored in the 45th minute for Pillars before Daniel Ebuke continued his scoring spree with another strike in the 63rd minute to make sure Pillars win the match. But Emmanuel Mathew reduced the deficit for the hapless Anambra Warriors. Pillars are still atop with seven points with two wins and a draw.

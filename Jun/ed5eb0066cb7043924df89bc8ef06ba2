Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) at the weekend advocated for a concessionary tax rate for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) in the country. LCCI made the call at a Business investor stakeholders’ meeting organised by the Chamber on Friday where deliberations were made on several issues impacting on the business environment. LCCI at the meeting also expressed concern about the persistent delays in the issuance of the Pre-Arrival Assessment Report (PAAR) to importers by the Nigeria Customs Service. As contained in its communiqué made available to DAILY INDEPENDENT, Muda Yusuf , the chamber’s Director-General, said the advocacy was embarked upon “to promote the objectives of job creation and inclusive growth as enshrined in the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP)”. He explained that small businesses are more vulnerable to the current challenges in the economy, hence the high mortality rate, and added that SMEs deserve every support that the government can give. The Chamber also disclosed that “The PAAR situation is contributing to cost escalation for many businesses; cargoes are delayed unduly leading to the payment of avoidable demurrage and high interest cost on borrowed funds by importers. “The protracted delays in the issuance of PAAR are a negation of the policy of the government on Ease of Doing Business”. The LCCI, therefore, calls on the Comptroller General of the Nigeria Customs Service, to urgently intervene to put an end to the persistent delays in the issuance of PAAR.

Lagos – Super Eagles defender, Leon Balogun, has said that Sunday’s (today) last Group B match at the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) against Madagascar will be tougher than many of the Super Eagles’ fans expect it to be.
The match comes up at the Alexandria Stadium in Cairo, Egypt by 5pm while the other teams in the Group, The Swallows of Burundi and Syli Nationale of Guinea will square up at the Al Salam Stadium at the same time.
The defender said that they cannot afford to take the game for granted, despite having qualified for the next stage of the tournament.
”I think we have done a great job. At the end we were better, that’s why we qualified. We have another game against the Barea of Madagascar.
“I would say it’s a wrong approach to take the game easy because there’s another game coming after.
”Madagascar won’t take it easy, they also want to qualify, they’ve still got chances after their draw against Guinea (and victory over the Swallows of Burundi).
“So, it won’t be an easy one but, definitely, we can be more relaxed than them. (However,) we would be well advised to keep our form up”, he said.
That victory over the Swallows of Burundi took the country on to four points in Group B, just two behind the Super Eagles of Nigeria’s six, such that victory against the Super Eagles on Sunday (today) would take them top of the table with seven points, and the opportunity of bragging rights into the round of 16.
Both teams have met four times with the Super Eagles winning on three occasions while they played a goalless draw in one of the meetings.

Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House needs to ensure the case to impeach President Trump is “ironclad” — as she was grilled on why the process hasn’t started yet. Impeaching the president was the topic du jour during the top Democrat’s appearance on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” Thursday night. “We’ve been on that path for a while and when we do get to where we’re going, we’re going to be ready,” Pelosi demurred. Kimmel interrupted, “But it feels like we’ve been on the path for a really, really long while, like since the ’70s.” “You have to remember, we’ve only had the [congressional] majority … since this year, and the first month, government was shut down,” she responded. Pelosi reiterated her belief that Trump wants to be impeached — so he can be exonerated by the GOP-led Senate while Democrats risk facing a political backlash. “He knows it’s not a good idea to be impeached, but the silver lining for him is then he believes he would be exonerated by the United States Senate,” she explained. “And there’s a school of thought that says if the Senate acquits you, why bring charges against him in the private sector when he’s no longer president? So when we go through with our case, it’s got to be ironclad.” But Pelosi acknowledged that impeachment would likely “divide the country” when “we have to try to bring people together.” She also said no one knows better than she — except for the president himself — why he needs to held accountable. “The only person who knows better than I why this president is not above the law, why this president must be held accountable, the only person who knows better than I do is the president of the United States,” she said. “He knows. He knows what his violations have been.”

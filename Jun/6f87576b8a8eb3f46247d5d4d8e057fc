Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Since Mohamed Salah signed for Liverpool, there has been an 18.9 per cent drop in the number of hate crimes in the Merseyside area, and the number of anti-Muslim tweets posted by the club’s supporters has “halved”, a study has found. The report, produced by Stanford University in the USA, is titled: “Can Exposure to Celebrities Reduce Prejudice? The Effect of Mohamed Salah on Islamophobia Behaviours and Attitudes”. It comes to the conclusion that: “Overall, we interpret these results to support the hypothesis that Salah’s arrival at Liverpool FC caused a decrease in extreme acts of bigotry”. Research from four university professors is based on 936 county-month hate crime observations, 15 million tweets from British football fans, and an original survey experiment of 8,060 Liverpool fans. “We find that Merseyside county (home to Liverpool F.C.) experienced an 18.9 per cent drop in hate crimes relative to a synthetic control, while no similar effect was found for other types of crime,” the study says. “We also find that Liverpool F.C. fans halved their rates of posting anti-Muslim tweets (a drop from 7.2 per cent to 3.4 per cent of tweets about Muslims) relative to fans of other top-flight English soccer clubs.  “The survey experiment suggests that these results may be driven by increased familiarity with Islam. Our findings indicate that positive exposure to outgroup role models can reveal new information that humanises the outgroup writ large.” The 26-year-old is one of four Muslims in the Liverpool squad, along with Naby Keita, Xherdan Shaqiri and Sadio Mane. Salah’s goal celebration regularly includes performing sujood, the Islamic act of prostration to God.

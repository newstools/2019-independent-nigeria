Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The underwriters of Uber Technologies’ initial public offering yesterday overwhelmingly recommended the company’s shares, even as they estimated deeper losses than previously expected for the ride-hailing service this year. With the end of a quiet period related to Uber’s disastrous IPO last month, at least 15 banks involved in the public listing initiated analyst coverage of the company, all of them positive except for Citi’s “neutral” rating. “Uber is a transformational company that should benefit from secular shifts to the sharing economy (Rides), time saving services (Eats), and more efficient marketplace evolution (Freight),” Bank of America analyst Justin Post wrote in his report, setting a $53 price target. Uber’s stock was up 2.4% at $42.22. Still, shares have dropped 6% from the price set in the May 9 IPO amid investor worries over whether the company is able to make money. About $5 billion of Uber’s stock market value has evaporated since the hotly anticipated IPO, making that event a major disappointment for the company, its shareholders and underwriters.

Egypt coach Javier Aguirre warned his side not to underestimate Uganda when they aim to secure top spot in Group A at the Africa Cup of Nations on Sunday.
The hosts are already assured of qualification through to the last 16, and need only a draw at the Cairo International Stadium to progress in first place.
Uganda, though, are also unbeaten, having drawn with Zimbabwe after beating the Democratic Republic of Congo.
“I think it will be a tough challenge. Uganda are a strong and well organised team who play with a fighting spirit during the complete 90 minutes,” Aguirre said at a press conference reported by the Egyptian Football Association.
Uganda manager Sebastien Desabre maintains his side will be ready for the Pharaohs.
“We love challenges. My players are very motivated, I have confidence in them and it is possible to beat Egypt,” Desabre said at press conference, as quoted on www.fufa.co.ug.

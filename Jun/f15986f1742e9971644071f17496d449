Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has apologised to the public for her handling of a controversial legislative bill that will allow for extraditions to China. “The chief executive acknowledged that the lack of government work has caused great contradictions and disputes in the community of Hong Kong,” the government said in a statement. “Many members of the public are disappointed and saddened. The chief executive apologises to the public and promises to accept it with the utmost sincerity and humility,” the statement added. Lam’s apology came as hundreds of thousands marched in the streets and called for her resignation, with many saying they were unhappy that she had only suspended the bill without withdrawing it completely. The government said it does not have a timetable to restart discussions on the bill.

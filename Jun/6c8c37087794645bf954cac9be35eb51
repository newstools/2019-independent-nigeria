Nobert Okonkwo, the team’s Media Officer said on Wednesday that Rangers will bounce back as their target was the NPFL title. Okonkwo, who admitted that Rangers were sloppy in their opening game said, “Rangers are still in contention for the title; although the team started on a bad note, they will bounce back – they should not be written off. “There are five matches to play in the competition and we have played just one which we lost; there are also hopes that we can win our remaining four matches to clinch the title – the team need to work hard,” he said. He said that the players have put the loss behind them and focused on the game against Lobi today. While Rangers will play Lobi in the second game today, Akwa United that drew 2-2 with Pillars will open the day against IfeanyiUbah, while Pillars will host Enyimba in today’s last game.

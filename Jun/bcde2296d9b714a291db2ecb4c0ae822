Powered by RubiQube Ad Network NASA has a message for space lovers this month: Look up. The largest planet in the solar system, Jupiter, will be clearly visible June 10 — and to see its biggest moons you’ll only need to grab a pair of binoculars, according to Cbsnews.com reports. NASA said the gas giant is at its “biggest and brightest this month” and will be visible all night. The planet will reach opposition, the annual occurrence when the Jupiter, Earth and the Sun are arranged in a straight line, with Earth in the center. So, mark your calendars for Monday, as it will be the best time of the year to see it. What's Up for June?

The devices will also allow people to spot Jupiter’s four largest moons, and possibly even a “glimpse” of part of the banded clouds that surround the planet. Scientists believe the planet has a combined 79 moons — 53 named and 26 awaiting official names.

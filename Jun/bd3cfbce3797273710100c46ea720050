Powered by RubiQube Ad Network LAGOS – Gernot Rohr, Super Eagles’ coach is impressed with John Mikel Obi’s performance in trainings ahead of the forthcoming Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) billed for Egypt. Rohr disclosed that the player was blending well with the squad, despite having been away since June last year, when he last played for the team at the 2018 FIFA World Cup match against Argentina in Russia. Mikel missed the Nations Cup qualifiers, but Rohr said that he was picking up the piece pretty fast. “Since the FIFA World Cup in Russia last year, we have five or six new players who did very well, so it is my job now to integrate the players with Mikel Obi. ”There was no problem with his integration, the players are happy to see him back again, he’s working hard. “He had a good second half of the season with Middlesbrough, and his leadership role in the team will help these young players in Egypt. ”We have six standby players, two played in the FIFA U-20 World Cup and the other ones are ready if there’s injury. “I don’t want to have any injury and that is why we are preparing this team very well,” said Rohr. In Mikel’s absence, Rohr gave several players their debuts in the team, such that the Super Eagles’ captain is now meeting Paul Onuachu, Semi Ajayi, Jamilu Collins, Samuel Kalu and Samuel Chukwueze for the first time. Nigeria has been grouped alongside two debutants at the AFCON 2019 namely Burundi and Madagascar as well as Guinea. Their first match will be against Burundi on June 22 before taking on Guinea on June 26 and then Madagascar on June 30.

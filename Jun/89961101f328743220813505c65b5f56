Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Iran has increased its enriched uranium reserves to 3.67 percent, but within the framework of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), according to a report from the United Nations published here on Monday. The report says that on May 26, the Islamic Republic had 125.5 metric tons of heavy water, 0.4 percent more than in February, but still under the 130 tons established by the JCPOA. Until May 20, Iran had 174.1 kilograms of low-enriched uranium, compared to 163.8 kilograms in February, of a limit of 300 kilograms. In early May, Iran announced that it would break the restrictions established in the nuclear deal as a protest against the withdrawal of the United States and the sanctions imposed on Tehran. Since then, Iran has quadrupled its production of enriched uranium, after complying with a decision by the Supreme National Security Council, according to the spokesman for the Iranian Atomic Energy Organization, Behruz Kamalundi. However, the Islamic Republic has not exceeded the restrictions established in the nuclear agreement signed with six world powers in 2015.

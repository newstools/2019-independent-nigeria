Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The Buhari Support Organisation (BSO) has assured Nigerians of its commitment to Next Level agenda as promised. Reacting to recent developments in the polity, Prince Felix Awofisayo, Zonal coordinator of the Buhari Support Organisations in the Southwest, stated in a media parley in Oshogbo, capital of Osun State, that unfolding events are an indication that the Next Level is taking off in a structured and invigorating manner. According to the Ife born politician, the impressive sweep of the APC’s candidates in the election for the leadership positions in the National Assembly affords the country an opportunity to make a decisive advance. Securing the support of other parties during the elections in his opinion is a clear testimonial to the acceptance of the need to forge a national democratic agreement to move the country forward on the trajectory of a progressive legislative agenda as opposed to the contrived legislative gridlock of the past. This is a further indication of a nationwide acceptance to coalesce around the integrity banner held high by President Muhammadu Buhari as demonstrated by his convincing re – election. In a communiqué signed by Kanmi Ademiluyi, Director, Media Services Buhari Support Organisations, Southwest Region, Prince Awofisayo lauded the clear commitment made by the President to lift a hundred million people out of poverty within 10 years. In his opinion, poverty eradication is the key moral issue of our time which a man with the demonstrated integrity position of President Buhari is well suited to carry out. Prince Awofisayo further noted that the poverty reduction commitment is a tribute to the central thrust of the 1993 campaign of Bashorun MKO Abiola “A farewell to poverty “.

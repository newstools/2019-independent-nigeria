The coach, who spoke through Super Eagles official twitter handle, where he noted that in the first matches, clubs or countries are always fresh, noted that even the so called smaller opponents would be very difficult to play against in opening matches. “I think we can come out of the group. From there, we can then take it match by match, but the most important thing now is the first game against Burundi,” Rohr stated in an a video interview on the official Twitter handle of the Super Eagles. “The first game is always important. It is always difficult. Everyone is always fresh, the small countries don’t have anything to lose. “Burundi have good players in England and Europe. They have players in South Africa which makes them a dangerous opponent,” he said. But speaking further, the coach said that he was banking on the 2018 FIFA World Cup experience of his young team to excel at the tournament, revealing that a good number of the squad are in the team to Egypt. “But we are Nigeria. We played at the 2018 World Cup in Russia as one of the five African countries, which is good for us. We also have 15 players from the team which is quite remarkable. ”

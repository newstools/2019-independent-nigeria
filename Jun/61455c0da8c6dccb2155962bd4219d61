Powered by RubiQube Ad Network YENOGOA – Publish What You Pay (PWYP), Nigeria, a non-governmental organisation (NGO), has held a one-day training workshop on environmental, social and human rights impact assessment (ESHRIA) in Bayelsa State for community members, ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) and civil society organisations. The training, which took place in Yenagoa, was facilitated by MacJim Foundation, the implementing partner of PWYP on the programme. Oke Ayoka and Godson Jim- Dorgu, officials of the PWYP and MacJim Foundation, delivered presentations on “Human Rights and Corporate Governance” and “Integrating Social and Human Rights into Environmental Impact Assessment”, among others. Among the state MDAs represented at the training were the ministries of education; environment; information; women affairs; works and infrastructure; trade and investment; community and social development, and social development agencies. At the event, stakeholders expressed worry over low awareness on ESHRIA among communities as this had affected their capacity to track and evaluate development projects in their communities. The stakeholders, in a communiqué, noted that there was a high level of ignorance among communities on the importance of environmental, social and human rights impact assessment and how to go about it. They, therefore, called for more sensitisation of communities on ESHRIA by CSOs and faith-based organisations, stressing that the state House of Assembly should also review state legislations on environmental, social and human rights impact assessment. The participants equally suggested that the state government should empower Ministry of Environment with adequate funding for capacity building of ministry staff on ESHRIA issues. “The state Ministry of Environment should make educative materials available on ESHRIA to other MDAs and to the public.

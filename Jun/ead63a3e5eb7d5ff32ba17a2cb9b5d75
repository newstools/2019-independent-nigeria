Powered by RubiQube Ad Network A Sudanese opposition leader, who returned to the country after years in exile, was arrested in Khartoum on Wednesday afternoon, a senior opposition official said, according to Radiotamazuj.org reports. Yasir Arman, the deputy leader of the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-North under the leadership of Malik Agar (SPLM-N Agar), returned to Khartoum weeks after President Omar al-Bashir was ousted from power in April. Mubarak Ardol, the spokesman of the opposition faction, told Radio Tamazuj that Mr Arman was arrested by National Security and Intelligence Services in Khartoum. “Comrade Yasir has been arrested by national security officers. He is now under arrest,” Ardol said. The reason for Mr Arman’s arrest remains unclear. Last week, Arman said he received six letters; five sent by the deputy head of the military council and commander of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), Mohamed Hamdan Hemeti, and one by the chairman of the junta, Abdel Fattah al Burhan, demanding him to leave Sudan. However, the opposition leader defied requests by the ruling military council, that he leave the country.

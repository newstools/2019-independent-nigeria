Powered by RubiQube Ad Network LAGOS – Nigeria Flying Eagles have arrived in Lodz on Saturday, ahead of their Monday’s FIFA U20 World Cup Round of 16 game against Senegal. Nigeria finished third in Group D and only qualified as one of the best four third –place finishers in the six groups, while Senegal, Africa’s vice champions, finished at the top of Group A after two wins and a draw. Nigeria are yet to impress in Poland since their opening day 4-0 lashing of Qatar in Tychy. A 0-2 loss to USA and 1-1 draw with Ukraine meant the Flying Eagles had to sneak into the knockout rounds, but the spirit in camp is high following qualification. Half of the Round of 16 fixtures are all-Confederation clashes. Apart from Nigeria/Senegal, South American representatives Uruguay and Ecuador are up against each other, as Asians Japan and South Korea, and European teams Italy and Poland. Meanwhile, Taiwo Oloyede, ex-international, has predicted a tough game against Senegal. Oloyede said that it will be hard for the Flying Eagles to scale the hurdle judging from their performance in Poland. “They are one of the best teams so far in the tournament and it will be tough match for the Flying Eagles,” he said.

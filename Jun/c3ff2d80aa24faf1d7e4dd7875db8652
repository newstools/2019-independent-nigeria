ABUJA – Bala Mohammed, the newly sworn-in governor of Bauchi State, has been urged to concentrate on governance and stop witch hunting his predecessor, Abubakar Mohammed. The advice came from a civil society organization, Nigeria Civil Society Desk. The group noted that Mohammed was on a vendetta and witch-hunt mission against his predecessor. The CSO, which urged Bala to concentrate on why he was elected as governor of Bauchi State in the 2019 election, added that as a newly elected governor, it is not yet enough time for the governor to have made a thorough check of the books and records of the office he just breezed into. The Nigeria Civil Society Desk, in a statement by its National Secretary, Ijewa Zeb Obioma, National Publicity Secretary, Nwokolo Peter and National Coordinator, Emeh Friday Eleojo, said that it was unfortunate that Mohammed kicked off his administration with a rancorous and chaotic state legislature and also with questionable process of leadership election.

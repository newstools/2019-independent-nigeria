Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Iran will hand over Nizar Zakka, a Lebanese citizen and holder of U.S. residency who was detained in 2015 for “collaborating against the state” to Lebanon’s Hezbollah, the semi-official Fars news agency said on Monday, citing an unnamed source. “The move would take place in the next few hours.. This is done solely because of the respect for and dignity of Hassan Nasrallah (Iran-backed Hezbollah’s leader),” the source told Fars. Zakka, an information technology expert who has permanent residency in the United States, was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2016 and fined $4.2 million.

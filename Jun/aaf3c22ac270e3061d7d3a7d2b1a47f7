ABUJA, GOMBE – A group, Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC), has said the involvement of security agencies, especially the Nigerian Army in the recent general elections would continue to impact negatively on the polity. It said the growing insecurity being experienced in the country cannot be unconnected with the perception the electorates have about the various security agencies. Auwal Musa Rafsanjani, the Executive Director of CISLAC, made the observation on Thursday, while delivering a research paper titled: ‘Involvement of Nigerian Security Services in the Electoral Process: Guardian or Threat to Democracy’. This is even as the group, also on Thursday, tasked newly sworn-in state governors to own the fight against acute malnutrition currently ravaging children in the country. Rafsanjani said the call has become necessary considering the fact that many international donor organisations have started withdrawing from funding many programmes in the country, adding that before now, many state governments did little or nothing to the fight thus leaving everything to the donor agencies.

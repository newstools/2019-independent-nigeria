The President recalled his meeting with the cleric at State House, Abuja, last October, during which the latter shared deep insights about the country, and how he prayed with him, and the country, particularly in respect of the last general elections. Buhari, who spoke through a statement by his media aide, Femi Adesina, applauded the divine wisdom, and temperate nature, which Kumuyi exude at all times, and prayed that God would give him longer life, and greater grace to serve God and humanity. Pastor Kumuyi attracted diverse reactions from Nigerians when he warned Christians against criticising Buhari recently. While delivering a sermon, he had admonished that the faithful should live like Christ and accept the leadership that God had given them. The cleric also urged his congregation to honour their pastors like their political leaders.

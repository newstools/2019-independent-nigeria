The body, in a statement on Friday, said whatever must have informed the President’s decision to refuse his assent is far less important than signing the bill into law. The statement signed by Barrister Pereotubo R. Oweilaemi, IYC President, Worldwide, described the Maritime University, Okerenkoko, as a viable weapon restoring peace in the region, adding that the survival of that school means economic growth in the oil sector. He stressed that Buhari should consider the welfare of the people more than personal beliefs, adding that rejecting the bill, as passed by the National Assembly, would pose grave danger to the oil sector. He said: “No Niger Delta person will be happy seeing the school being traded off on the altar of politics. Buhari should know that the desire of the people supersede his personal reasoning. We will not sit idle and allow our only heritage taken away from us. “If there are issues the President may want to contend with, rejecting his assent is not the best option especially now that the 8th National Assembly is about winding up. “Mr. President can correct any of the identified ambiguities even after signing the bill. There is room for amendment. His decision simply means that the school has no enabling law and thus, its survival is being threatened. “We beg President Buhari to have a rethink of his inimical decision. Calling on the National Assembly to veto his assent may be difficult given the short time they’re leaving office. “It seems to us that Buhari only ambushed us by taken this provocative action at the dying minutes of the 8th Assembly’s tenure in office. His decision only signposted economic disaster to the oil industry.”

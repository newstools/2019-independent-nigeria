LAGOS – The Director General of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), Dr Dakuku Peterside has stated that the nation’s ocean’s resources are rich enough to sustain the economy just like most countries with maritime based economy. Peterside, who spoke during the commemoration of the World Ocean day at the weekend, also charged stakeholders on the need to celebrate the ocean as a result of its importance in the lives of our nation, and on how economic diversification can be achieved for sustainable growth and development. The NIMASA Director General noted that, like the cyber world which has reduced the real world to a global village, the ocean is global and connects people worldwide, thus inspiring continuing action year-round to protect and restore this amazing resource that we all depend on. Like most great maritime nations, he pointed out that the “time has come for all hands to be on deck and support the Federal Government’s efforts in taping into the blue economy and develop it to such a level that it can contribute far more greatly as projected.” Peterside further observed that nations like Singapore, Philippines and Malta along with the world great economies like the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, Russia and China amongst others thrive greatly on their oceans as the bedrock of their economy, and with about 90 percent of world trade being done by sea and shipping, it is time Nigeria begins to join the league of such great countries by engaging its waters more profitably. “The World Oceans Day celebration inspires the thinking that recognises that there is one global ocean that connects the entire world. Within this one ocean, there are five distinct oceans: the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Arctic Ocean, and Southern Ocean. And it is already happening that the boundaries of these oceans are invincible and so it is important that we take steps to ensure that we tap the abundant resources inherent within our maritime endowment because our lives as a nation depends hugely on it,” the DG said.

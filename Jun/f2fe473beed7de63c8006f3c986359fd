Powered by RubiQube Ad Network ABUJA – An estimated seven million people die untimely yearly around the world due to poor air quality, Mrs. Ibukun Odusote, Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Environment has disclosed. Speaking Friday at an event to commemorate the World Environment Day (WED) in Abuja, Odusote said that 92 per cent of the world population also breathes unclean air, adding that the situation has cost the global economy a whopping $3.5 trillion yearly. Represented at occasion by the Director, Human Resources and Management, Daniang Peter, the Perm Sec, who described the situation unacceptable, noted that the most worrisome issue is the ozone layer depletion. According to her, ozone layer depletion has over the years gradually exacerbated the ever increasing world temperature with the resultant effects on agriculture, human health and biodiversity in general. “It is frightening to know that on yearly basis, an estimated 7 million people worldwide die untimely due directly or indirectly to poor air quality. It is also estimated that 92% of the world population breathe unclean air and this has cost the global economy a whooping $3.5 trillion on yearly basis,” she stated. Odusote said that the theme “Air pollution” of this year’s WED could not afford to have come at a later time in view of the threat posed by air pollution worldwide. She noted that air pollution is wreaking havoc more especially in cities of the world where industries keep growing, releasing dangerous gasses and pollutants into the air without effective and commensurate efforts at mitigating the negative trend.

P/HARCOURT – The Rivers State Government, on Thursday, announced that henceforth it would bankroll the form fees for the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) of Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) for all Indigenes and non-indigenes in the state. Governor Nyesom Wike, who made this known, said that the gesture from the state government would commence with the 2020 UTME to be conducted by JAMB. Speaking during a courtesy visit by the registrar of JAMB at the Government House in Port Harcourt on Thursday, Governor Wike said that the Rivers State Government was committed to ensuring that less privileged students are not denied the opportunity to sit for the examination. “From 2020, UTME forms for indigenes and non-indigenes will be paid for by the Rivers State Government. It is important for us to ensure that children of the less privileged don’t bear this burden. “This offer is to ensure that no qualified candidate is denied the opportunity to write the UTME. For some parents, the fee is nothing, but there are families that cannot afford the fees”. The governor also announced the allocation of land at the Greater Port Harcourt City to JAMB for the construction of their zonal office. He also allocated a block of offices to JAMB as their temporary office in Rivers State, following the dilapidation of the current office. He also donated an operational vehicle to JAMB in the state. Registrar of JAMB, Professor Ishaq Oloyede, commended the Rivers State governor for his commitment to the development of education, especially his abolition of fees for secondary and primary schools in the state. He appealed to the Rivers State Governor to allocate a temporary office to JAMB for their daily operations as the current office has totally degenerated

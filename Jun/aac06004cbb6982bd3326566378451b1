Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Bharti Airtel is expected to rely heavily on an upward revision in mobile tariffs in the medium term to sustain a whopping $8 billion of incremental investments it is estimated to make over the next three years in greenfield 5G rollouts and in expanding existing 4G networks, analysts said. Rajiv Sharma, co-head of research at SBICap Securities, estimates Bharti Airtel will need to invest “an incremental $5 billion over the first three years even for a selective 5G rollout, and an additional $3 billion for 4G expansion, for which mobile pricing will need to be revised upwards, primarily to support upcoming investments in 5G spectrum and networks.” The challenge, he said, is that: “Bharti doesn’t see mobile tariffs rising anytime soon, and we also believe any meaningful increase in mobile pricing is at least 2-3 quarters away.” Analysts said Airtel’s recent mega fundraise via rights issue, bond sales and an upcoming Africa IPO is expected to address balance sheet concerns and cut leverage, but incremental investment needs towards 5G spectrum and network rollouts would have to be recovered from operating income growth, which can happen once mobile tariffs rise. Gopal Vittal, Bharti Airtel’s Managing Director (India & South Asia) recently said he expects tariffs to firm up, adding its current ARPU of Rs 123 had not reached sustainable industry levels. “Bharti Airtel’s management said (on a recent earnings call) that nothing much has accrued towards ARPU growth from the conversion of 2G subs to 4G, which suggests that it is not revenue but cost savings that will accrue to the company in the medium term with the closure/trimming of its 2G network as it shifts more resources to 4G,” said Sharma of SBICap Securities.

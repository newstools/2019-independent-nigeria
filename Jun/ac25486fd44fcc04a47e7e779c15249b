Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said the large number of political parties that participated in the 2019 general elections created a lot of logistics problem. Mallam Mohammed Haruna, National Commissioner in charge of Kwara, Kogi and Nasarawa states, stated this on Saturday in Ilorin while speaking with journalists. This was a fall-out of a workshop organized by INEC in Kwara State to review the 2019 general elections. The workshop was attended by Electoral Officers, Assistant Electoral Officers (AEO) in charge of Operations and RAC from the 16 local government areas of the state. According to Haruna, there were 799 litigations from the 2019 general elections across the country. He said that Jigawa had no petition from the election, Kwara had only three petitions and that Imo topped the list with 77 petitions. Haruna said that there were over 800 million pre-election cases across the country that arose from political parties’ primary elections. “So you can see that with these kinds of problems we had, there is really a need to look at the number of political parties. “We really need to do something about the 91 political parties, not just the quantity which generally speaking the public have begun to complain that 93 political parties are on the high side,” he added. He noted that 76 political parties contested for the Presidential election, adding that this was the source of the serious logistics problem that the commission had.

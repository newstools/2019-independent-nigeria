A 2-year-old boy vanished from his Virginia home after his mom put him to bed early this week — and he’s been missing ever since, according to local police, According to Nypost.com. Noah Tomlin was last seen around 1 a.m. Monday, when his mother told police she laid him down for the night at their Hampton mobile home, local police chief Terry Sult said at a Monday press conference. The tot’s mother reported him missing by 11:30 that morning, Sult said. Cops launched a number of searches, but couldn’t find Noah anywhere, so they called in other local agencies — and even the FBI — for assistance. “We’re considering everything from the child just walking away, but at two years old, probably not able to walk too far, all the way up to and including foul play,” Sult said. “We’re looking at all potential possibilities. We’re not ruling anything out until we find the child. So we’re going to take it as though [it’s the] worst case and hope for the best.” Hampton police spokesman Reginald Williams told local outlet The Daily Press Tuesday that this is the longest missing child search he’s worked on throughout his career. “Our concern is just as high now as it was in the beginning,” Williams said. “Locating this juvenile is an extremely high priority for us.” “We’re going to be going through the neighborhood with a fine-toothed comb,” he added — noting that authorities are also searching Mill Creek, which reaches within a few hundred feet of the mobile home park. Trash collection was suspended in the area as police searched local dumpsters. Tomlin was last seen wearing a white and green pajama shirt and diaper on the 100-block of Atlantic Avenue in Hampton, police said. Anyone with information should call 757-727-6111, Hampton police said.

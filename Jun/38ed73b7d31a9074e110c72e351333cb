Powered by RubiQube Ad Network A property caretaker, Wole Ogunleye, on Friday appeared before an Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court over alleged theft of N4.2 million. Ogunleye, 43, who resides at Abule Egba, Lagos, is facing a charge of stealing. He, however, pleaded not guilty. According to the prosecutor, ASP Benson Emuerhi, the defendant stole N4.2 million paid as house rent by tenants of the complainant, Mr Yisa Bello. He submitted that the caretaker committed the theft sometime in November 2018 at No. 473, Abeokuta Expressway, Abule Egba, Lagos State. “The defendant collected the money from the tenants and failed to deliver it to the complainant. “Ogunleye converted the money to his personal use and absconded. All efforts made by the complainant to get the defendant to give him the money proved abortive,” Emuerhi said. He noted that stealing from one’s employer contravened Section 287 (7) of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The section provides for a seven-year jail term for stealing from one’s employer. The Chief Magistrate, Mrs Olufunke Sule-Amzat, granted the defendant N200, 000 bail with two sureties in like sum. She said that the sureties must be blood relations of the defendant and show evidence of tax payment to the Lagos State Government. The chief magistrate adjourned the case until July 18 for mention.

Dede, told SATURDAY INDEPENDENT recently, that the current team competing for honours at the FIFA World Cup in France have no reason to fail, urging them to at least reach the semi-final. “If we were motivated the way the present team are being, we would have surpassed World Cup quarterfinal best outing. Apart from the fact that the NFF pay them far better than what we were getting during our time, most of the players now are playing abroad and it was not so during our time. So we would have broken the quarter final jinx with such support,” she said. “When I look at what they call match bonuses now, I marvel because the match bonus for each of the players now is just the totality of what we get individually at the end of a tournament and we were still very happy. I think the NFF have done well and I am happy that things are looking up with the team,” she noted. Dede was part of the Falcons that won the 2010 and 2014 Africa Women Cup of Nations. She was capped 99 times. Meanwhile, Falcons coach, Thomas Dennerby, has made Asisat Oshoala the deputy captain of the team. This comes weeks after he appointed Desire Oparanozie as the captain of the team. 36 year old Onome Ebi, who is appearing in her 5th World Cup, was previously the captain of the team, while Rita Chikwelu was her co-captain, but Thomas Dennerby said that he wanted someone that will always be on the pitch as the captain and so he appointed Desire Oparanozie as captain

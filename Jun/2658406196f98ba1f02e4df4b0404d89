Powered by RubiQube Ad Network A new policy paper published by the Chinese government is reported to have pushed oil prices lower in Asian trade, dragging benchmarks downward despite US and China recent talk’s failure. However, prices quickly rebounded on Saudi Arabia reassurances that the non-members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would continue to manage crude oil supplies. This made Brent crude to be traded at $62.70 a barrel with West Texas Intermediate changing hands at $54.45 a barrel. Both benchmarks were up over one per cent from opening. S&P Global Platts cited reports from other media saying the policy paper held U.S. President Trump responsible for the recent breakdown in trade negotiations, which hardly bodes well for the future of the negotiations. Prices tumbled on the news, but rebounded as Saudi stoked market optimism with vague promises of continued production quotas. Just days after the last report on how well trade talks between Washington and Beijing were going President Trump complained on Twitter they were going too slowly and threatened new tariffs. He went through with the threat—to increase tariffs from 10 per cent to 25 per cent on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods—and the retaliatory move came promptly, with China raising tariffs on U.S. liquefied natural gas. Following this latest exchange of tariffs, Chinese refiners and commodity traders began shunning U.S. crude oil, refusing to commit to long-term contracts, which in itself weighed on oil prices.

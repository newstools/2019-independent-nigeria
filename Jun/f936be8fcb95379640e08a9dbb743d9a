ASABA – Senator Ifeanyi Okowa, the Delta State governor, has said the perpetuators of the ritual murder of Elozino Ogege, must be brought to justice. Miss Elozino Joshuana Ogege, a 300-level student of Mass Communication in Delta State University (DELSU), Abraka, was murdered by suspected ritualists on November 15, 2018, four days after she was declared missing in Abraka. Speaking in Asaba during the presentation of a N6 million cheque as financial assistance to her family, Okowa assured Deltans of government’s readiness to tackle security challenges in the state. He decried the incidents that led to Miss Ogege’s murder, assuring that no stone would be left unturned in ensuring that the perpetuators were brought to justice. The governor, represented by Olorogun David Edevbie, his Chief of Staff (CoS), assured that government would continue to put in place measures to tackle security challenges facing the state, stressing that “What happened to late Miss Elozino Ogege last year was so unfortunate and heartbreaking, which told us that all was not well in our society. This is why we are doing everything possible as a government to improve security in the state and ensure that security challenges are effectively tackled.” He commiserated with the family of the deceased, assuring them of government’s support. Mrs Elizabeth Ogege and Rt. Rev. John Aruakpor, Bishop, Diocese of Oleh, Anglican Communion, who spoke on behalf of the family, thanked Okowa for the compassion showed to the family of the deceased, even as they called on government to put more initiatives in place to tackle insecurity in the state.

Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The Indian Navy (IN) has successfully deployed the first of its two imported deep submergence rescue vehicle (DSRV) in a ‘live mating’ exercise by safely transferring personnel from a simulated submarine in distress. The IN said on 5 June that the exercise, which had taken place three days earlier off India’s eastern port city of Visakhapatnam, involved a UK-built DSRV, and Sindhughosh (Project 877EKM)-class submarine INS Sindhuraj, the latter of which simulated the platform in distress. The IN said that the drill, the first of its kind to be conducted by the service, would “pave the way for it to be a submarine rescue provider in the Indian Ocean region”.

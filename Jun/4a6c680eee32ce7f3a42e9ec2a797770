Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Romelu Lukaku, Manchester United forward has reportedly agreed terms with Inter Milan ahead of a potential switch to the Italian giants in this summer’s transfer window. Lukaku, who only scored 15 times for the Red Devils during the 2018-19 campaign, has been strongly linked with a switch to Inter – now managed by Antonio Conte. According to Gazzetta dello Sport, the Belgium international has already agreed personal terms on a contract until the summer of 2024, but Inter are yet to settle on a transfer fee with the Red Devils. Earlier this week, the 26-year-old said that it was ‘up to United’ to decide his future as the speculation gathered pace. The centre-forward has scored 42 goals in 96 appearances for the 20-time English champions since arriving from Everton in 2017. However, it has been claimed that the former Anderlecht youngster is not considered to be mobile enough by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.

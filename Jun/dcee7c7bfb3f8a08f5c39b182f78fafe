Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The Gombe State Recovery Committee has urged the immediate past governor of the state, Mr Ibrahim Dankwambo, and his aides to appear before it. The committee said the invitation was for the past administration to account for property it disposed of illegally. Chairman of the committee, retired Group Capt. Peter Bilal, made the call while briefing newsmen on Saturday in Gombe. He said if they failed to appear, the committee would resort to legal actions to recover the state assets that were disposed of without due process. Governor Inuwa Yahaya set up the committee following his inauguration to recover alleged government property improperly disposed of by the immediate past administration of Dankwambo. He alleged that a lot of government property worth billions of naira were improperly disposed of during Dankwamboâ€™s tenure. Bilal also called on any persons in possession of government property to return them as soon as possible. He alleged that all efforts to get Dankwambo and his aides to account for how the state government property were disposed of and some cash withdrawn from government coffers at the twilight of his administration had failed. According to him, the committee has recovered some while some beneficiaries voluntarily surrendered theirs.

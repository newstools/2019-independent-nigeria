Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Though the number of demonstrators rose slightly last week across France, they remained well below earlier peaks seen in November and December, when an estimated 300,000 took to the streets on Saturdays in protests that often resulted in widespread violence and vandalism in Paris, According to Presstv.com. The “yellow vests” protests, named after the bright jackets French drivers have to keep in their cars and which have been worn by demonstrators, began in November after public anger against fuel tax rises. Those were subsequently scrapped but the movement has since morphed into a broader anti-government protest. The number of protesters has gradually fallen as a result of measures taken by President Macron to quell the public anger, such as tax cuts to boost consumers’ spending power. However, some demonstrators on Saturday said they would continue to protest over Macron’s policies.

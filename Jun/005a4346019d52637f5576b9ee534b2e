Powered by RubiQube Ad Network LAGOS – Asisat Oshoala is soliciting for support for the Super Falcons ahead of the FIFA Women’s World Cup kicking off in France on Friday. She noted in a post that Nigerian soccer fans now have a duty to support Falcons all the way, despite doubts hanging over their chances in Group A against Norway, Korea and the hosts, France. Oshoala posted: “No matter what, they’re still going to have to keep putting in the effort and support the female team.” Oshoala is relishing her return to regular scoring form with the team, and hopes it continues that way in France. Oshoala was on song once again for the Falcons on Sunday, as she scored a brace in their 3-0 win over ZNK Pomurje in their final tune-up game. Thomas Dennerby, we learnt, dropped a hint to his starting line-up for their World Cup opener against Norway on June 8, with starting spots to Oshoala, Ngozi Okobi, Desire Oparanozie, Francisca Ordega, Halimatu Ayinde, Rita Chikwelu, Onome Ebi, Ngozi Ebere, Faith Michael, Osinachi Ohale and goalkeeper, Chiamaka Nnadozie. He then made a rash of substitutions in the second half with as many as seven players entering into the fray, including Uchenna Kanu, Chinwendu Ihezuo, Chinaza Uchendu, Anam Imo, Amarachi Okoronkwo, Evelyn Nwabuoku and Rasheedat Ajibade.

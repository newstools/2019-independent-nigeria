The clash occurred as a result of two rival groups attacking one another. It was gathered that one of the rival groups embarked on revenge mission following the killing of one person few days ago who is a member of another group. The development resulted in violent clash leading to sporadic shootings, which cause panic in the ancient city of Osogbo. The State Police Public Relations Officer, Mrs. Folasade Odoro confirmed the arrest of the suspects and allayed fear of the people of the state that the situation is under control. Odoro said that the arrest of the suspects resulted from raiding of criminal hideouts and black spots along major highways and environs, and the unrelenting effort of security personnel in the state. Odoro said that the measures were being taken to put an end to all forms of violent crimes and criminal activities across the state. “The arrested suspects are presently undergoing an investigation to ascertain their level of involvement relating to violent crimes on major highways and towns within the state. “More so, in the interest of peace and tranquility, the command is using this medium to warn all rumour mongers against all acts of misinforming the public through social media platforms. “This is done through circulating false rumours, thus, creating the wrong impression of insecurity and crisis in the state. “The Commissioner of Police, Abiodun Ige, reiterates that the existing peace in the state, which is not negotiable, will be sustained as visibility policing is being intensified to forestall any break down of law and order,’’ she said. Odoro advised the people of the state to go about their lawful businesses without fear of any intimidation.

Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Following the recent removal of the Oando’s Group Chief Executive Officer, Wale Tinubu, and his deputy, Omamofe Boyo and the subsequent clampdown on the company by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), two non-executive directors have resigned. Oando Plc notified the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), its shareholders, stakeholders and members of the public of the resignation of the directors, Sena Anthony and Oghogho Akpata, from its board. According to a statement on the NSE website, their resignation became effective from Monday, June 3. “Chief Sena Anthony and Mr. Oghogho Akpata were active members of the board and its sub-committees. The board and management of Oando Plc appreciate their valuable contributions to the growth of the company,” Oando said in the three-paragraph statement. The statement also barred them from holding director positions in public companies for a minimum of five years. While the SEC has set up an interim management to be headed by Mutiu Sunmonu, Tinubu and Boyo have secured a court order by Justice Mojisola Olatoregun of the Federal High Court in Lagos which orders the SEC and Mr. Sunmonu to maintain status quo pending the determination of the motion on notice. The commission has said the interim management would oversee the affairs of Oando Plc and conduct an Extra Ordinary General Meeting on or before July 1, 2019.

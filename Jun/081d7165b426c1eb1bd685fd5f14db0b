Nigeria sit third in Group A standing behind France on six points and Norway on the same three points as the serial African champions but the Scandinavian country has a better goals aggregate of +2 as against Nigeria’s -1. South Korea, however, are last on the log with no point yet. Meanwhile, a win for Nigeria and Norway’s expected victory over South Korea will throw the group open with the three countries on six points each. If that happens, other variables like the goals difference and head-to-head will be used to determine those who will book automatic ticket to the next round. However, even as so many pundits have predicted Nigeria’s loss against the hosts, particularly with their vociferous fans behind them, goalkeeper, Chiamaka Nnadozie, who kept a clean sheet against Korea Republic in Nigeria’s second match, said she was sure the Super Falcons won’t capitulate against France. While speaking to the media ahead of today’s decisive game against the hosts, the 18-year-old insisted that France would come tough but that they would have to match them if Nigeria would progress to the next round. “This is one match we are not going to take lightly because our continue stay in this competition is dependent on it. France are the host and so many people will expect that they overrun us but we won’t lose the match,” she sounded confidently

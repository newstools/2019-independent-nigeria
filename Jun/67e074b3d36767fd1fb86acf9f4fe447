LAGOS – Ebenezer Babatope, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain and former minister of transport, has appealed to President Muhammad Buhari to take decisive action on the insecurity in the country, saying that nobody is safe anymore with the way things are going. The Afenifere chieftain, who spoke to DAILY INDEPENDENT on Thursday, said that he was worried that considering the way the nation’s security had collapsed and the comment of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, which he made outside the shore of this nation, that the insecurity situation in the country was being exaggerated, could be a source of concern to any right-thinking Nigerian. He said that it was on record that the high and mighty had been attacked by criminals, kidnappers, herdsmen, Boko Haram and so it became disturbing that the number two citizen could ever imagine that the issue was being blown out of proportion. He maintained that it was a huge misrepresentation for anyone to go abroad and say it was an exaggeration. Babatope said that thousands of Nigerians had become refuges in their father’s land and that there was no visible sign of improvement. He said that the recent invasion of the South West had become another problem for the Yoruba people, wondering how it could be explained that the South West governors rose from a meeting on insecurity and within 24 hours, 28 persons were kidnapped on Ondo road. Babatope stressed that the president should, as a matter of urgency, look into the security challenge in the country, and examine the security apparatus in the country and thus make necessary review before the situation would overwhelm everybody. He warned that this time around politics should be removed from the issue of security. Commenting on the resolve of Afenifere to use traditional method to defend itself, he said that the primary responsibility of the state was to protect life and property of the citizens which according to him was the reason for governance in the first place. He stated that if government relegates that responsibility to the citizens it was a sign of failure on the part of government and was quite regrettable

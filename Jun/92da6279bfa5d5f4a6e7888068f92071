A 27 year-old ex-banker, Vincent Ita, who allegedly stole his former employer’s N1.7 million, was on Friday brought before an Igbosere Magistrates’ Court in Lagos. Ita, whose residential address was not provided, is standing trial on a two-count charge of conspiracy and stealing. He pleaded not guilty to the charge. Earlier, the Prosecutor, Sgt. Friday Mameh, told the court that the defendant conspired with others at large and committed the alleged offences on Dec. 20, 2017, at noon, at the United Bank of Africa Plc, Lagos. He said that Ita, a former staff of the bank, used the opportunity and stole N1.7 million, belonging to the United Bank of Africa Plc, his former employer. Mameh said the offences contravened Sections 287 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. Section 287 prescribes a punishment of three years, while Section 411 provides two years punishment for offenders found guilty of the offences. The Magistrate, Miss T. A. Idowu, admitted him to bail in the sum of N250, 000 with two sureties in like sum. She ordered that the sureties should show evidence of tax payments to the Lagos State Government. The case was therefore adjourned until July 25, for mention.

Powered by RubiQube Ad Network A man who impersonated a Saudi prince to con investors and live a lavish lifestyle has been sentenced to 18 years in prison. Anthony Gignac received the sentence on Friday in Miami for stealing at least $8 million ($11.5m) while impersonating Sultan Bin Kahlid Al-Saud, buying a Ferrari, Rolex watches and renting a condo on an exclusive South Florida island. The Miami Herald reports that US District Judge Cecilia Altonaga called him a “mastermind.” Gignac was born in Colombia 48 years ago but was adopted by a Michigan family as a young child. He is an American citizen. He pleaded guilty in March to wire fraud, impersonating a diplomat and other crimes. He told Altonaga on Friday that while he accepted responsibility, other people were involved and should have been charged.

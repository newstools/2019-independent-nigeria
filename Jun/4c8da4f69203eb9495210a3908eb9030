Mrs Oludolapo Osinbajo, the vice president’s wife, has said the play, ‘Area Boy’ reminded her of time spent working in the slums of Lagos among the street urchins. Mrs Osinbajo disclosed this at the National Conference for the MTN-led Anti-Substance Abuse Programme held in Abuja. “I insisted on watching the play, which is based on the perils of substance abuse, because I wanted to recollect a past experience. “I wanted to watch the drama to relive again the times that I spent working in the slums of Lagos among the ‘area boys’, among prostitutes, among the rejects, and the lost. “The drama was so life-like that I can pinpoint aspects of my experience in the dramatic piece, and as the drama went on, I can identify some people that I knew so many years ago,” Mrs Osinbajo said. She urged everyone, all stakeholders, to join in the fight against drug abuse, as this multi-headed monster required a multi-stakeholder intervention. After a compelling performance, the play received a thunderous applause from the hundreds of guests, which included politician and businessman, Mr. Tonye Cole; wife of Kebbi State Governor, Hajia Zainab Bagudu, and others. The second and last performance of the day was an energetic musical show by David Jones, an actor, singer and anti-substance abuse advocate, who joined the trail last month. The MTN Anti-Substance Abuse Project (ASAP) is an initiative spearheaded by MTN Foundation, to deliver interventions that contribute to a significant reduction in the rate of drug abuse among youths.

Oni Daniel Oluwatope approached me and indicated interest for the car and thereafter issued me a cheque being value of the agreed amount and left with the car. However, when I presented the cheque in my bank it was returned unpaid even after 48 hours and when I tried to reach Oluwtope his phone was switched off and all efforts made to get him was abortive hence the petition”. The defendant pleaded not guilty to the charge preferred against him.

Barty, 23, defeated unseeded American teenager, Amanda Anisimova to reach her first Grand Slam singles final. The Australian beat her 17-year-old opponent, ranked 51st in the world, 6-7 (4-7) 6-3 6-3 in a rollercoaster match. Anisimova battled from 5-0 down to take the opening set on tiebreak and led 3-0 in the second before Barty rallied. “That was amazing, both good and bad,” said Barty, who took more than a year away from the game to play professional cricket before returning in 2017. “It was the hardest thing that I ever had to do. “I am really proud of the way I fought, especially in the conditions which were cold and windy. “Now I can’t wait for the final, it’s incredible”, said Barty. On the other hand, 19-year-old Vondrousova defeated Johanna Konta 7-5, 7-6 (7-2) to reach this final. Konta, 28, was unable to convert three first-set points – and paid the price. Konta was bidding to become the first British woman to win a Grand Slam singles title since Virginia Wade triumphed at Wimbledon 42 years ago and the first singles player from the nation – man or woman – to win at Roland Garros since Sue Barker in 1976. “It is always tough to lose a match, any match, and always tough to lose matches where you have opportunities and chances,” said Konta, who had never won a main-draw match at the Paris venue before this tournament.

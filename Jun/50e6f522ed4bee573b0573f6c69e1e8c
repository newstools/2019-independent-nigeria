Abuja – The National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN), under the leadership of Amb. Comrade Sukubo Sara-Igbe Sukubo has dissociated itself from the honour conferred on former President Olusegun Obasanjo. NYCN, in a statement by its National Public Relation Officer, Olugbode Damola Hammed said Sukubo was dismayed on receiving the news of an honour conferred on Obasanjo as “Father of the Nation” and a donation of One Million Naira cheque to buy books for his presidential library by one Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere and Nihi Oladele John in the name of the National Youth Council of Nigeria. “This occurrence is not only unfortunate but a national robbery in broad daylight. “For the record, the Ikenga Ugochinyere was a former Senior Adviser to former Senate President,  Dr. Abubakar Saraki, the spokesman of the Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP) and the Nihi Oladele John was also a member of PDP Kogi state campaign team and still personal assistant to Senator Dino Melaye,” the Sukubo-led council said. They said that the leadership of the council has on several occasion dissociate self from Ikenga and Nihi, adding that they don’t represent the interest/structure of the council at any level. “The general public is therefore advised not to fall victim of the duo. “It’s worrisome that these charlatans could do this to a prominent personality as the former President of Nigeria. While we sympathize with the former President, we urge him to subsequently, ascertain the authenticity of the group with the Ministry of Youths and the necessary security apparatus before opening his door to the impostors,” the council said.

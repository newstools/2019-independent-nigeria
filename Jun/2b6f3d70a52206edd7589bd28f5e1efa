Powered by RubiQube Ad Network A 53-year-old estate agent, Joshua Daudu, was on Friday brought before an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court, Lagos, for allegedly obtaining N690,000 from a man and failing to rent out office space to him as promised. Daudu, who resides at Ikeja, Lagos, however, pleaded innocence to the two-count charge of obtaining money under false pretense and stealing. The Prosecutor, ASP Clifford Ogu, said that the defendant committed the offence in August 2018, at Ogba, Lagos. He said that the defendant collected the money from one Mr Michael Oyadele, the complainant. “The complainant approached the defendant for office space, and after negotiations, the defendant asked him to pay N690, 000, which the complainant paid. “After the defendant collected the money, he was nowhere to be found. “Efforts made by the complainant to get the office space or retrieve his money proved unsuccessful, as the defendant refused to pick his calls,” Ogu said. He said that the complainant reported the case and the defendant was eventually arrested. Ogu said that the offence contravened Sections 287 and 314 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. Section 287 prescribes three years imprisonment for stealing, while Section 314 stipulates 15 years for obtaining money under false pretense. The Magistrate, Mr J.A Adegun, granted the defendant bail of N100,000 with two sureties, who should be gainfully employed and show evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State Government. He adjourned the case until Aug. 14, fora –

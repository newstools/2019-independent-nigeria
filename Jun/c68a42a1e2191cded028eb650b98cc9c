ENUGU – Osita Okechukwu, Director General of Voice of Nigeria and All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain has agreed with the final report of the European Union Observer Mission on 2019 general elections. Okechukwu in a reaction during a chat with journalists in Enugu said the EU Observer Mission’s final report had vindicated some of them who posited that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) did not generate the result of the election from the server. Recall the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had earlier claimed that its presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar defeated President Muhammadu Buhari of APC, based on the result from INEC server. Okechukwu, however, said he was glad to hear the Deputy Chief of the Observer Mission, Hannah Roberts agreeing with the reality of relying on results that were released by INEC. “We had maintained that it is trite law that you cannot build something out of nothing. Accordingly, we agree with EU Election Observer Mission denial of knowledge of the existence of the so-called server used by INEC to conduct 2019 general elections.” “What amazed one is the paradox in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP’s) canvass that in one breath, INEC conducted elections transparently in Adamawa, Bauchi, Imo, Oyo, Zamfara etc, where they won and in another breath manipulated the results in axis it lost.” “Methinks it is wrong to gloss over the truism that President Muhammadu Buhari has a 12 million Vote- Bank, which had been on display in 2003, 2007, 20011, 2015 and 2019 presidential elections.”

Powered by RubiQube Ad Network A cons t r uct i o n worker and graduate of Geology and Minning from the University of Jos, Oladipo Oyefemi, 33, has been arrested by the Police in Jos for allegedly killing a 24-year-old woman, Patience Musa Oyefemi, a resident of Millionaires Quaters, Jos. The suspect, was said to have picked the 24-year-old Musa at the West of Mines area of Jos, around midnight of Friday, May 31, allegedly for a night of fun. A News Agency of Nigeria investigation revealed that the duo had agreed on a fee of N3,000 for the night. Oyefemi, however, allegedly killed the woman while she was at his house and tried to dump her body but was apprehended by a vigilante group keeping watch around the quarters. Father of the deceased, Musa, a resident of Tudun Wada said that he received a distress call from his daughter’s phone from someone who flatly told him to go to the Nasarawa Gwom Police station. According to him, “I was at home in the morning of Saturday, June 1, when I received a call from my daughter’s phone but heard a man’s voice at the other end asking me to proceed to the Nasarawa Gwom Police station. I thought she was involved in a fight or some kind of trouble with someone and got arrested, but when I arrived at the station, the Police men told me that my daughter was killed and her body dumped somewhere. They asked me to follow them to the hospital to identify her body. At the Jos University Teaching Hospital Mortuary, I discovered that the body was actually my daughter’s, even though she had already changed in appearance. She had stab wounds all over her body and her tongue was sticking out. I want the authorities to investigate this matter to its logical conclusion and find out why my daughter was killed. This is too painful for all of us to bear. She was killed in cold blood, all I want is justice”.

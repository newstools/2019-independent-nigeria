Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Super Falcons kicked off their 2019 Womenâ€™s Wold Cup in France on Saturday losing 3-0 to Norway. The Nigerians started brightly but the more technically gifted opponents took advantage of their defensive frailty to punish them. Norway opened scoring on 17th minute when Guro Reiten shot was deflected by Onome Ebi into the net. The goal was a wakeup call on the Nigerians but their efforts did not yield any dividend as they fluffed various scoring chances. The Nigerians paid for a poor defensive play when Norway doubled their lead through Lisa-MarieUtland, who was left unmarked in the area. Her shot sailed into the net with ease. Three minutes later, they got their third when Osinachi Ohale jabbed the ball into her own net. The second half was no different as Falcons continued their poor scoring form. Asisat Oshoala threw away a golden opportunity on 70th minute failing to score with the goalkeeper displaced. Meanwhile South Africa also started their campaign losing 3-1 to Spain.

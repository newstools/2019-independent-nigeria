Former Super Eagles defender and coach, Austin Eguavoen, has revealed that the current national team has what it takes to comfortably win the 2019 edition of the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). Nigeria qualified for the tournament to be staged in either Egypt or South Africa after topping group D with 10 points and a game to spare and the former Nigerian international believes that with the crop of players in the team, Nigeria can go into the tournament with full confidence. “It is very possible. The players have done well so far, my only worry now will be selection of players because all the players Gernot Rohr has invited have all done well which is very good, so he has a big pool of players to select from which might be a problem for him but good for Nigeria.” Nigeria last featured at the Cup of Nations in 2013 where they won the trophy and were tutored by late Stephen Keshi and Eguavoen insists that the team is better than that of 2013. “My prayer for them is to win the African Cup of Nations because we have players that play in the big leagues now unlike before, if they maintain their performance and can stay fit health-wise, I think we have a very big chance.”

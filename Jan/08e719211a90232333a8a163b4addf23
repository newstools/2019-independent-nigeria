Abuja – Ahead of the 2019 general elections, an All Progressives Congress (APC) senator, Kabiru Marafa, on Tuesday said that allowing APC to be on the ballot for National Assembly, governorship and state Assembly elections at this time would be injustice of the highest order. The senator, who told the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to respect the court judgment, added that APC had no candidate in Zamfara for the coming general elections as ruled by a Federal High Court in Abuja last Friday. Addressing newsmen in Abuja, Marafa said he didn’t mind if APC lost the state, urging INEC to stand by its earlier position that the party in Zamfara State had no candidate for the coming elections, having failed to conduct primary elections within the time-frame provided for it. He said: “There is limit to loyalty. My loyalty first and foremost is to the Federal Republic of Nigeria, because we must have Nigeria before we can have the Senate. “So, my loyalty is first to my God and to my people. APC is not a religion. So, if APC decides that the worst APC candidate is better than the best other candidates from anywhere, I will respect them because they are in politics to field candidates to win elections. “But that cannot be true to me. So, I would go for the best for my people. So, even if it means APC loses in Zamfara State, I don’t give a damn. After all, the crisis that we are in today started with the APC itself. “The governor (of Zamfara State) is going around whipping sentiments that INEC should not accept the court judgment delivered in my favour because APC would lose Zamfara if the party did not present candidates for the election. “Thank God President Muhammadu Buhari has broken the barriers in the political space now. Before, it was the President that needs the governors. Today, the President does not need the governors to win elections; rather, they need him.

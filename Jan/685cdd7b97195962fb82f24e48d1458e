ABUJA – Members of the House of Representatives on Wednesday reconvened for the last lap of their legislative sessions and adjourned proceedings for Thursday to honour former president Shehu Shagari and Abayomi Abdul-Kabir Ayeola. The House, which came back from 2018 Christmas and New Year holidays, was to commence proceedings, but had to observe tradition of suspending plenary in honour of dead colleagues or any former leader. It would be recalled that Shagari, who was also one time member of the House died on December 31, 2018 while the House was on Yuletide recess. Similarly, Ayeola, a serving member of the House, representing Ibeju-Lekki federal constituency of Lagos State on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) also passed on during the break. The House Speaker, Yakubu Dogara, after reading official communication from the deceased respective families called for Christian and Islamic prayers for the repose of their souls While the Christian prayer was offered by the deputy chief whip of the House, Pally Iriase, from Edo State, Abubakar Chika Adamu from Niger State took that of Muslim. Dogara later announced that Thursday plenary would be dedicated to valediction in honour of their fallen colleagues. Meanwhile, the House is set to take the second reading of the 2019 budget proposal on Thursday. The House speaker made the announcement on the floor, saying that debates on the general principles of the money bill would come after the scheduled valedictory session. Recall that President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday, December 19, 2018 presented the budget estimate before a joint session of the national assembly.

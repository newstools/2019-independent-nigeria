US R&B singer R Kelly has been dropped by his record company, Sony’s RCA, in the music industry’s highest-profile casualty of the #MeToo era. RCA’s agreement to part ways with Robert Kelly (52), confirmed by a person briefed on the move who declined to be identified because the deal was confidential, came after weeks of protests. A recent television documentary, Surviving R Kelly, drew wide attention for its visceral testimonials by women who said that, as underage girls, they had been lured into sexual relationships with Kelly, and abused by him mentally and physically. The documentary series chronicled decades of allegations against Kelly, including that he operates a so-called sex cult in which he physically and emotionally abuses women and keeps them from their families. Kelly’s representatives say that the women who live and travel with him are doing so voluntarily and that he has not abused any of them. “They were perfectly consensual relationships,” Kelly’s lawyer, Steven Greenberg, said last week. Mr Greenberg told US television show Dateline that every woman who had come forward to accuse Kelly of misconduct was lying. Activists who had been calling for Kelly’s dismissal cheered RCA’s decision to drop him, while still criticizing the label for its slow pace, and they pushed the entertainment industry to punish Kelly further. Cardi, who has recently taken on the likes of Donald Trump and conservative commentator Tomi Lahren on social media, responded to Hamill yesterday (January 22) by explaining that the ‘Twerk’ video “says to women that I can wear and not wear whatever I want, do whatever I want and that NO still means NO.”

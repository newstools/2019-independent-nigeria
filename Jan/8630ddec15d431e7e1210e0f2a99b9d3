Lagos – Both Sunshine Stars of Akure and FC IfeanyiUbah headlined the match-day five of the 2018/2019 Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) season as both clubs recorded wins outside their home grounds. Playing at their Abubakar Tafawa Balewa Stadium home ground in Bauchi, Wikki Tourists were defeated by Sunshine Stars through a solitary goal by Chibundu Amah in the 80th minute. Amah was quick to react by tapping in the rebound after Wikki goalkeeper saves Sunday Abe’s spot kick. In Kaduna, FC IfeanyiUbah defeated home side and newly promoted FC Kada 1-0 through a goal by Chibuike Eze in the 62nd minute. In the result of other matches, Rangers defeated Enyimba 1-0 at the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium in the highly anticipated Oriental Derby. Rivers United beat MFM with the same score line in a match played in Port Harcourt. CAF Champions League campaigners, Lobi Stars, whitewashed Kwara Unied 3-0 in Makurdi, even as Remo Stars, playing in Osogbo, beat Katsina United 2-0, while Yobe Stars defeated Heartland 1-0 in Damaturu. In the other matches, Abia Warriors and Gombe United fired blank in Umuahia, even as similar score was recorded in the match between Niger Tornadoes and Insurance of Benin in Minna. It was also a goalless affair in Jos where former champions, Plateau United, engaged Kano Pillars.

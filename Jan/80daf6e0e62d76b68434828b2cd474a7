OWERRI – Rochas Okorocha, Imo State governor, has urged widows of the fallen heroes to remain courageous especially when they remember that their husbands sacrificed their lives so that the nation could have peace, telling them that God would never forsake them even when men do. Governor Okorocha spoke at a Church Service to mark the Armed Forces Remembrance Day Celebration at the Victory Chapel, Government House, Owerri, on Sunday, stating that he would continue to support them in their endeavours and also encourage other leaders to follow suit. He told the soldiers who were at the Church Service, “As Soldiers you should be committed to your job and imbibe the spirit of patriotism and nationhood,” adding that protecting the territorial integrity, lives and property of Nigerian citizens must be paramount. He said, “A hero does not complain or shake, no matter the difficulties he may face or pass in the discharge of his duties. A good soldier should not be afraid while discharging his duties as once fear sets in, failure follows. Our nation must continue to appreciate the sacrifices of our heroes past and must see it as an obligation to take care of the widows left behind.” At the end of the Church Service the governor conducted balloting for the widows. Three of them won cars and the rest of the widows had N5,000 each. The widows who won the cars are Mrs. Okpara Gertrude, Mrs. Paulina Mbaegbu, and Mrs. Esther Dike.

Palms Casino Resort announced the 26-year-old singer’s appearance as part of its debut of KAOS, a dayclub and nightclub amphitheatre-style complex that is set to open in April. Above and Beyond, G-EAZY, Kaskade and Skrillex are among the other artists who will have exclusive residencies at the complex. KAOS is part of the Palms’ 690 million dollar renovation that features state-of-the-art technology designed to enhance performances, including a rotating 360-degree DJ booth.

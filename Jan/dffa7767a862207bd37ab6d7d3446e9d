Senator Buruji Kashamu has urged the National Working Committee (NWC) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to respect the court judgment pronouncing him the party’s governorship candidate in Ogun. Kashamu spoke with newsmen on Saturday in Lagos in reaction to a statement credited to the party’s Publicity Secretary, Mr Kola Ologbodiyan, that the PDP would only recognise Mr Ladi Adebutu as candidate. Both Adebutu, a member of the House of Representatives and Kashamu had been locked in litigation over the party’s ticket, as they both emerged from two parallel congresses. But the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had on January 17, published the names of National Assembly candidates who belong to the Bayo Dayo-led state executive as the right PDP candidates in Ogun. Kashamu emerged from the congress conducted by the Dayo-led group while Adebutu emerged from the congress conducted by the Sikirulai Ogundele-led faction and backed by the NWC. Mr Festus Okoye, INEC National Commissioner for Information, Media and Voter Education, had  said on Wednesday in Abeokuta that the commission  published candidates in Kashamu’s camp in compliance with a subsisting court judgment pronouncing them as the right candidates. “Our position is that INEC received judgment of properly constituted courts of law and we have given effect to the judgment we have. “The judgment asked us to recognise the list of candidates submitted by a faction of PDP in Ogun State. “We have recognised candidates submitted by that political party and we have published the names recognised by the courts,’’ he said. Ologbodiyan, however, told newsmen in Abuja on Thursday that Adebutu remained the candidate of the party inspite of INEC’s publication of names in the Kashamu group. He said Adebutu was duly nominated by the party and asked INEC to name Adebutu instead of Kashamu as candidate.

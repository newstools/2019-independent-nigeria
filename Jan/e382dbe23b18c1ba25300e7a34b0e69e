UYO – Akwa Ibom State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has raised alarm over an alleged sinister plot by the All Progressives Congress (APC) APC to frame up, arrest and detain critical stakeholders of the party during the electioneering period. Obong Paul Ekpo, Chairman, PDP Akwa Ibom State chapter, saidon Sunday that an intelligence report reaching it had it that plans had been concluded to ensure that during APC rallies, buses branded as PDP buses or vehicles bearing state government number plates, would be loaded with arms and occupied by some criminals, heading for such rallies. He alleged that on approaching, the buses and their occupants would be arrested and the contents of the buses displayed for all to see as a major security breakthrough. According to him, the criminals would mention some PDP chieftains as their financiers, which would lead to their arrests and subsequent prosecution under the Anti-Terrorism Act. Ekpo said the plot which, he alleged, was hatched and sponsored by the opposition APC was aimed at arresting and incarcerating key PDP leaders and keeping them away from circulation throughout the elections. He said: “This is to say the least, very crude, anachronistic and antediluvian, signaling APCs imminent defeat at the approaching polls. “We have stated before and will reiterate now that we are a peace loving party, operating within the ambit of the law. Our leaders, who are currently being targeted by the opposition, are innocent Nigerians with proven integrity. “They do not engage in arms stockpiling, or procurement of violence in any form. It is therefore very unfortunate that people who should be planning for elections, are rather hatching evil plans on how to arrest people.” Ekpo maintained that that PDP would not send anybody to disrupt rallies or meetings of any other political party, even as he called on security agencies to note the intelligence and act swiftly.

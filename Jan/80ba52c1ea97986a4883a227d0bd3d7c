Tottenham were beaten 3-1 by Wolves in their only defeat in December, which dented their title hopes. And Pochettino feels that Wolves celebrations after the match show how much teams want to beat Tottenham now.“It’s a massive game for us every time. Wolves beat us and they behaved like they won the Premier League,” he said. “Then on Wednesday they lost to Crystal Palace. It’s because Tottenham have created something special — and now we are a target. When we fought with Leicester, everyone wanted to kill us! For many people we’re not very successful because we haven’t won a trophy [but] people respect the way we’re doing it.” On the day Wolves beat Tottenham, Pochettino’s side never really got going in the match. Mauricio Pochettino head coach Spurs took the lead in the first half through Harry Kane but failed to extend their advantage and were made to pay. Wolves struck back in the second half, as they scored three goals in quick succession to claim the three points. Tottenham have responded well to the defeat, and have pushed their way back up the table. But had they beaten Wolves, Spurs would be just three points off the top of the table now, and it could be a defeat which comes back to haunt them.

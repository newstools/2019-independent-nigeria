Lagos – The loan switch of Victor Moses to Turkish side, Fenerbache, has continued to elicit reactions from Nigerians with the latest comment coming from Adegboye Onigbinde, former coach of the Super Eagles, who said the move was a good one for the player. Onigbinde said the on-loan Chelsea player did the right thing if he must remain competitive in the game, saying that there was nothing wrong in making the move permanent if there is the need for such. “I read about his loan to the Turkey club. It is a good move for him because at Chelsea, he was out of relevance and no player prays for such. His problem was coming when he decided to quit the national team. “I think he took the right decision but he must also think of returning to the Super Eagles to help the country do well in the Cup of Nations because Nigerians were praying for him. If they can accept him at the end of the loan, he can remain there,” said the World Cup coach. Moses was unveiled on Friday as part of Fenerbache after he completed a loan move to the club earlier in the week. The move came after initial resistance from the player where sources said he was considering how he could move his family to Istanbul.

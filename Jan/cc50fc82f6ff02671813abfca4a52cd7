LAGOS – Barely two months after some helicopter operators accused the Nigeria Police of engaging in illegal charter operations, the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) has threatened to sanction any operator who illegally engaged in charter operations. There are also allegations in the sector that some private jet owners convert their jets to hire and reward, thereby denying the government of its rightful revenues, while approved charter operators too are short-changed in that process. About two weeks ago, one of the charter operators complained that some of the private jet operators convert their aircraft to commercial use. According to the source, in this era of political campaigns, some of the private jet owners use their jets to airlift politicians for hire and reward. A statement on Sunday by Mr. Sam Adurogboye, the General Manager, Public Affairs, NCAA, threatened that the regulatory agency may be compelled to wield the big stick any moment soon over charter operations by unauthorized permit holders. Although the NCAA was not specific about the illegal charter operators, the issue had been raging in the sector for close to a decade without a resolution. Adurogboye noted that by the warning, any operator caught engaging in such unauthorized services would have its Air Operator’s Certificate (AOC) suspended or revoked. He said holders of Air Transport Licence (ATL) and Airline Operating Permit (AOP) with valid AOC were the only operators authorised to carry out charter operations in the country. He insisted that the directive was in line with its statutory responsibilities of safeguarding the interest of the public and that of the investors in the aviation sector.

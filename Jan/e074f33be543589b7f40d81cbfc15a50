Owerri – A head of February 16th presidential and National Assembly elections, President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday enjoined the nation’s electorate to vote for candidates of their choice irrespective of their political or religious inclinations. He said that what should be uppermost in the minds of the citizens is the continued unity, cohesion and corporate existence of the nation. The president stated this at a one-day All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential campaign rally held in Owerri, Imo State capital, which was attended by chieftains of the party, including the national chairman, Adams Oshiomhole; Ministers of Labour and Productivity and Transport, Chris Ngige and Rotimi Amaechi; former Senate President, Ken Nnamani; Governor Rochas Okorocha and the party’s governorship candidate in the state, Hope Uzodimma. The president, who reaffirmed his resolution to fight corruption in the country, said that apart from achieving food security and improving the nation’s economy, he had also taken the bull by the horns to tackle insurgency in the country. He assured that he would continue to remain receptive to the worthy yearnings and aspirations of Nigerians despite the global worrisome economic recession. Oshiomhole dismissed insinuations in some quarters of hidden conspiracy against the South-East by the Federal Government, contending that the president had been fair to all sections of the country in political appointments and in the provision of infrastructure. They hailed him for his capacity, tenacity and capability in fighting corruption to a stand-still and enjoined the electorate to vote massively for him and for all the APC candidates in the forthcoming elections. Also speaking, Governor Okorocha commended the president for his administrative prowess but regretted that people who never helped to place the party on a sound footing in the state had been allowed to hijack it.

The ICC have suspended Pakistan captain Sarfaraz Ahmed for four games over his racist remarks directed at South Africa’s Andile Phehlukwayo during an ODI between the two teams last week. Sarfaraz was found to be in violation of ICC’s Anti-Racism Code, and will now miss the remaining two ODIs of the series as well as the first two T20Is against South Africa. Shoaib Malik has been appointed Pakistan captain in Sarfaraz’s absence. The incident happened in the 37th over of South Africa’s innings when Phehlukwayo edged a Shaheen Afridi delivery and completed a single. Ahmed was recorded on the stump mic saying, “Abey kaale, teri ammi aaj kahaan baitheen hain? Kya parwa ke aaye hai aaj?” which translates to, “Hey black guy, where’s your mother sitting today? What prayer have you got her saying for you today?” The comment was viewed as racially charged, inviting criticism from many corners including former Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar, who “strongly condemned” the act. “Sarfaraz aimed a comment at South Africa all-rounder Andile Phehlukwayo which resulted in Sarfaraz being charged with an offence under the Code,” an ICC release read. “As per Article 7.3 of the Anti-Racism Code, Sarfaraz will also have to undergo an education programme to promote the understanding and awareness of issues directly relevant to the offence that he has committed. The ICC will work with the PCB to determine when and how this should take place.”

Lagos – After failing to make the final three-man shortlist for the 2018 African Footballer of the Year nominees, Alex Iwobi has been urged to sustain his improvement in Arsenal and the Super Eagles and await his time for the prestigious individual award. This advice came from Ike Shorunmu, the team’s former goalkeeper and trainer, who said that Iwobi still has time to improve, believing that he has a better chance of winning the award in the future. He said in an interview with DAILY INDEPENDENT, given that it has been 20 years since a Nigerian player won the award, that the current young generation of players has what it takes to end the long wait. “Iwobi is a good player as all of us are seeing with his performance for Arsenal and even Nigeria, but I will advise him to continue to improve in order to stand a better chance next time. “He will surely win it someday if he keeps improving. His mates in the national team and the current young players just entering the team have better chances of ending this long wait because we have very good and talented players right now,” the 2002 World Cup goalkeeper said. CAF, on Wednesday, shortlisted the trio of Mohammed Salah and Sadio Mane, both of Liverpool, Egypt and Senegal, respectively as well as Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang of Arsenal and Gabon for the prestigious individual award.

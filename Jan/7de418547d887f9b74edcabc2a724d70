Tony Pulis, the Middlesbrough of England coach, is celebrating the arrival of Super Eagles captain, Mikel Obi, into his team, as he believes the former Chelsea ace would add experience and winning mentality to the side. Pulis was beaming with excitement after Mikel’s official unveiling on Thursday, during which the gaffer affirmed his expectation that the Riverside club’s promotion drive will now receive a massive boost. Mikel will now don jersey number 12 for the remaining part of the season at the former English Premier League club that previously had fellow-Nigerian stars, Yakubu Aiyegbeni, Bartholomew Ogbeche, Sammy Ameobi, Carl Onuoha Ikeme and Kenneth Omeruo in their past squads. Ahead of his debut, Pulis spoke in glowing terms about Mikel, who joins Boro on a free transfer in a short-term deal, after a successful medical. Pulis said, ”I’m pleased to get him in. He is a man with a lot of experience and quality. “He has a winning mentality and he wants to be here and be a part of what we are looking to achieve.” On his part, Mikel said: “The club wants to get promoted so hopefully I’m here to help in any way I can. “It’s a family club and this is what I want. I like stability and this is why I was at Chelsea for a very long time “I spoke to a few clubs and I also spoke to Tony [Pulis], had a good chat with him. He’s told me where he wants to go with it and it definitely fits with what I want to do.”

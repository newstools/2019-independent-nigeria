Makurdi – Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State said he regrets supporting the candidature and voting President Muhammadu Buhari during the 2015 elections. Subsequently, he has begged the people of Benue State to forgive him for supporting President Buhari. Ortom disclosed this during the campaign for his reelection at Wannune, Tarkaa Local Government Area (LGA), which is also the hometown of his estranged godfather, Senator George Akume, Benue North West. He also regretted that after the people massively voted for the President, he has decided to pay them back in a bad way. Therefore, he advised the people of the state to vote for the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, whom he described as the best friend of the Tiv nation. Ortom, who lamented the spate of killing of innocent people by suspected armed Fulani herdsmen, insisted that under his watch the state would not cede any piece of land for the creation of grazing routes. He was also dismayed that certain persons including Senator George Akume have betrayed the people before the Presidency that citizens of the state were responsible for the killings. The governor also stated that the greatest challenge confronting his administration was the non- payment of salaries, adding that he would source funds to clear the backlog to make life more meaningful to the people. Ortom stated that he had decided to seek an alternative platform on which to pursue his reelection, to better the lot of the Benue people.

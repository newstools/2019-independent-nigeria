ASABA – Mrs. Jennifer Abubakar, wife of the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, has warned that Nigeria could not afford to go to war despite all provocative tendencies from the presidency. This may not be unconnected with reactions trailing the suspension of the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Walter Samuel Onnoghen. She said this at the weekend in Asaba when she led thousands of Delta State women to pray for peace and unity in Nigeria, reminding that Onnogen’s issue had been condemned by the civil society groups, the European Union and opinion leaders. “We do not want a war; we can’t afford to go to war. We want to be together; I’m crying to my Lord, we need to pray to God.” Abubakar, while praying for the oneness of the nation and peaceful general elections in Asaba, urged the women to rise up in defence of the Nigeria’s democracy through prayers and balloting, come February 16. “It is not an easy journey. They will try to derail us. They will try to make us afraid; they will try to confuse us. We should not be afraid. God is our guiding light. He will show us the way. “Whatever our religion is, either Christian or Muslim; we need to pray for our nation. We need to pray for our nation because somebody’s blood has been spit. We need to pray because our nation is about to fall apart, we need to pray to God to hold it together. We need to pray for the future of our children, we need to pray for the future of Nigeria. “Women you need to come out February 16 and vote. We need to vote. Your vote is important, without your vote, we cannot go to the Promised Land. You need to bring out your children, you need to bring out your husbands, sisters and relatives”.

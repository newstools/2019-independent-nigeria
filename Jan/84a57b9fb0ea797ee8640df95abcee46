Seyi Akinwumi, the first Vice-President, Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), on Thursday described Super Eagles appearance at the 2018 World Cup as his greatest moment in Nigerian football in the year. Akinwunmi made this known in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos, while reflecting on the successes recorded in football administration in 2018. The Super Eagles led by Gernot Rohr had a fairly decent appearance at the 2018 World Cup in Russia, after playing in what many soccer pundits regarded as the “Group of Death’’. The team qualified for the World Cup in style, being the first African team to qualify after beating Zambia 1-0 in Uyo. They, however, failed to go past the group stage being sandwich alongside giant killers such as Croatia, which later reached the final, Argentina and Iceland. Also, the Super Falcons made the podium again after winning the 2018 Women Africa Cup of Nations (AWCON), hosted by Ghana for the ninth time. The Thomas Dennerby-tutured team has now become perennial winners, having won 11 times out of 13 of the previous tournament. On the successes recorded in sports in the year under review, Akinwunmi described it as an interesting, challenging and busy on for Nigerian football administration. “The past year was a busy one for football administration and I think it is difficult to pick the greatest moment. It has been an interesting one for all the teams. “For me, the best moment should be our appearance at the World Cup. The qualification is a special one and I cherish that a lot. “Another greatest moment for me in football was the goal the late Rashidi Yekini scored at the Super Eagles first appearance in the World Cup against Bulgaria in 1994,’’ he said.

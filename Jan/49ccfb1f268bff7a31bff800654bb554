The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Thursday released final list of candidates for the presidential and National Assembly elections, scheduled for February 16, barring APC candidates in Zamfara and Rivers states. The list published on INEC official website was signed by the Secretary of the Commission, Rose Oriaran-Anthony. The candidates and their running mates include President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Atiku Abubakar and Peter Obi of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Others are Omoyele Sowore of the African Action Congress (AAC); Dr. Obiageli Ezekwesili of Allied Congress of Nigeria (ACPN); Christopher Okotie of FRESH, as well as Prof. Kingsley Moghalu of the Young Progressives Party (YPP), among others.

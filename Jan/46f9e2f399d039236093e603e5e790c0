AWKA – Most Rev. Nicolas Okoh, Archbishop of the Metropolitan and Primate of the Church of Nigeria, Anglican Communion, has warned politicians against utterances  and conduct that will not promote the rule of law, saying they should not indulge in activities that could heat up the polity during and after the 2019 general elections. Okoh made the call at the Cathedral Church of Saint Andrews, Amichi in Nnewi South Local Government Area of Anambra State at the weekend during a two-day working visit to the diocese, which celebrated its 10th anniversary and 10th anniversary of Bishop Ephraim Ikeakor’s episcopacy. He tasked politicians on peaceful election, saying that there was very high tension in the country, which he said was a threat to the nation’s unity. He stressed: “The Nigerian state is bigger than any individual. So, all of us have a duty to ensure that Nigeria is not harmed in the course of electioneering campaign, during the election and after the election. “These three stages are very critical. We should work hard to ensure that peace reigns. If you win, be considerate in your victory, and if you lose, don’t kill anybody because of that.” Okoh commend Bishop Ikeakor for his 10 years Episcopal anniversary and several projects he built within the period. He said the diocese was replicating the tripod evangelism policy of the early missionaries, which hinged on education, medical services and the church.

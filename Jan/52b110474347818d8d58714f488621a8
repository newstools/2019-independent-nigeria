Music superstar Adele may have been serious about her hesitation to ever tour again. The Hello singer has reportedly closed her touring firm, Remedy Touring LLP, despite banking an estimated £142 million in one year. Fans are now concerned that the British singer really will quit touring after hinting that she won’t be performing any live shows in the future. According to The Sun, Adele filed a declaration of solvency to have Remedy Touring LLP put into voluntary liquidation on Friday. The popstar’s touring firm reportedly earned £142 million during her last tour. The company’s most recent accounts were filed in February 2018 and allegedly show that the popstar had a £142 million turnover from shows she performed between February 2016 and June 2017 on her 25 live tour. In 2018 alone, the firm reportedly earned a profit of £11.5 million and had almost £14 million in cash. Adele performed 121 shows on the mammoth world tour during 2016 and 2017 to a total audience of 1.5 million, across Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand. While on-stage at her final show at London’s Wembley Stadium in June 2017, the 30-year-old delivered the heartbreaking news that it might be her final tour. The Someone Like You hitmaker told the sold-out audience: ‘Touring isn’t something I’m good at. Applause makes me feel vulnerable. I don’t know if I will ever tour again. The only reason I’ve toured is you.’ She added: ‘I know I come across as very anti-fame and anti all that and it’s because I am. It’s because I want to surprise you. ‘I want the element of surprise for every time I come back and it’s so hard to maintain that. I am going on break and I am just going to be a mum for a bit and I’m looking forward to that, but I’ll always write music and I’ll always put it out and I hope that you’ll be here.

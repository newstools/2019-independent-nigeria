LAGOS – The Rector of the Nigerian College of Aviation Technology (NCAT), Zaria, Capt. Abdulsalami Muhammed has shed more lights into why the planned acquisition of 20 brand new trainee Diamond aircraft for the college is yet to be totally delivered about three years later. Speaking with aviation correspondent yesterday in Zaria, the Chief Executive Officer of the college, explained that the acquisition of the Diamond Aircraft Company based in Austria by a Canadian firm was responsible for the delay in delivery. However, our correspondent gathered that it would cost the government about $20m to acquire the 20 trainee modern aircraft for the college. Also, it was learnt that the contract included training of 20 engineers and pilots each in the handling of the equipment. Muhammed told journalists that the approval the college received from the government was to acquire 20 Diamond aircraft out of which five were two engines DA42 and 15 Assembly engine DA 40 aircraft. According to him, the college had taken delivery of one DA 42 aircraft in the April of 2017, while it also placed orders for additional aircraft from the company. He, however, said that the acquisition of the Austria’s company by a Canadian firm and its eventual relocation to Canada by the new owners stalled the agreement, but assured that the delivery of the equipment would continue this year. He said: “We were informed by the contractors that the Diamond Aircraft Company was bought over by another company and that new owner decided to relocate the production place from Austria to Canada and they told us that they won’t be able to produce another aircraft until nine to 10 months, which is when the assembly line would have been completely relocated.”

Lagos – After his excellent performance at the 2018 ITTF African Championship in Mauritius, Olajide Omotayo is not afraid of any player in the continent having conquered some of Africa’s giants in Mauritius. The 22-year-old believes that the 2019 Africa Games would afford him the opportunity to prove that his outing in Mauritius was no fluke. “In 2019, I want to double my effort and focus on the tactical aspect of the game because I believe that before going out there, I need to work on my tactics. “With my performance in Mauritius, all eyes will now be on me across the world and I must not disappoint. “I remain grateful to the Nigeria Table Tennis Federation (NTTF) for believing and giving me the opportunity to excel,” he said. “My first tournament will be the ITTF World Tour in Hungary follows by the Portugal Open and others. I need to be focused because there are so many tournaments to be played especially the Africa Games and other African tournaments as well. “I must also thank God for where he has brought me and I believe he is yet to do more in my life. I will remain positive as always and keep fighting for the best that I can be,” Omotayo noted. It will be recalled that a semifinal finish on Sunday September 9, 2018 was a most satisfactory conclusion for the 23 year old at the 2018 ITTF African Championships in Port Louis, Mauritius. After overcoming Togo’s Atarou Assou and Angola’s Elizandro André, he caused a major upset by beating Egypt’s Mohamed El-Beiali, the No.3 seed and then Shady Magdy, also from Egypt, to book his place in the penultimate round; the round where colleague, Quadri Aruna also from Nigeria ended his progress.

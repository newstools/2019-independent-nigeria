Lagos – Emmanuel Amuneke, the coach of Taifa Stars of Tanzania, will be on duty at the CAF U20 Cup of Nations starting on Saturday as the continental football body has appointed the former Nigerian international as part of its technical study group for the championship. It could be recalled that Amuneke was part of the FIFA study group in 2018 World Cup in Russia. Amuneke is also presently preparing Taifa Stars to play their last match of the AFCON qualifiers against Uganda. A victory for Tanzania will make the team to break 38 years record of not attending AFCON knowing fully well that the last time Taifa Stars participated in the Cup of Nations was 1980 when it was hosted by Nigeria. Amuneke is gradually carving a niche for himself as far as African and world football are concerned. He is a former player of the Super Eagles who won the U17 World Cup as the assistant coach in 2013 and also won it again two years later as the head coach in 2015. Amuneke was part of Nigeria’s golden generation, which won the 1994 Africa Cup of Nations and also qualified Nigeria for her first World Cup in the United States in the same year.

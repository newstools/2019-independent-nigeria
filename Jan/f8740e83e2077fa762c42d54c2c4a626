The 16-year-old made his debut for the U17 team in August last year and has been a regular call-up to manager Brian McLaughlin’s squads since. Ecrepont is enjoying the best season of his young career so far and is delighted with another call up to the national team. He said: “It is always an honour being able to represent myself and Ayr United for my country. Everyone aims to get a first team Scotland cap one day, but I’m very proud to be representing them at any age group.” Somerset Park boss Ian McCall has already included the emerging talent in some of his first-team squads this season, with the full-back making his debut in November’s 5-0 win over Dundee United at Tannadice. However, the Ayr United academy product insists his main aims for the rest of the season are to continue developing as a player. Ecrepont said: “Being 16 years old and a local academy boy, I was really proud of making my debut for Ayr United. I’m not bothered about my game time at the moment as I’m young and still playing at a high level with the Ayr Reserves. I would like to keep my place in the Scotland squad and just work my socks off and see where the season takes me.”

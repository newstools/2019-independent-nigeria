Lagos – Asisat Oshoala, the Dalian Quanjian of China forward, has posited that the nine-time African champions, the Super Falcons would not disappoint Nigerians in France when the 2019 FIFA Women World Cup gets underway. The forward, who is the reigning Africa Footballer of the Year, explained that as long as Nigeria prepares well, she fears no foe in Group A. Speaking further, the former Liverpool and Arsenal Ladies striker noted that in France, she would not be aiming for individual glory but the success of the team as a unit. “I’m really not concerned about the group because I know we will do well if we get the best preparation for the championship. It is 11 against 11 on the pitch and with the new confidence in the squad I’m sure we will do well. “The primary aim is to qualify for the World Cup in France which we have done and hopefully we can win the trophy so whatever thing comes with it whether the MVP or the top scorer award, those are just secondary objectives. I don’t like putting that first because I have won them series of times so it’s not really important to me.” Oshoala is among the three-woman shortlist for the 2018 Africa Women Player of the year. She will come up against compatriot, Francesca Ordega, and South Africa’s Thembi Kgatlana, who was named the Most Valuable Player (MVP) at the last Africa Women Cup of Nations. Nigeria will come up against hosts, France, Asian giant South Korea and Norway in Group of this year’s World Cup.

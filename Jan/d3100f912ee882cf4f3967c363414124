Switzerland’s Roger Federer and Belinda Bencic secured a 2-1 victory over Germany’s Angelique Kerber and Alexander Zverev to win the Hopman Cup for the second year in a row. In a rerun of the 2018 final, Federer beat Zverev 6-4 6-2 to give the Swiss an early 1-0 lead. Wimbledon champion Kerber then overcome Bencic 6-4 7-6 (8-6) to level the tie. However, the Swiss claimed a tight 4-0 1-4 4-3 (5-4) win in the mixed doubles to claim their fourth Hopman Cup title. The mixed doubles is played in a fast four format – the first team to four points wins, with a tie-break held if the scores are 3-3. Twenty-time Grand Slam champion Federer is the first player to win three Hopman Cups – twice with Bencic and once with Martina Hingis, in 2001. It has been reported that the Hopman Cup will be replaced by an ATP tournament from next year.

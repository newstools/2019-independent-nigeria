An Iyaganku Chief Magistrates’ Court, Ibadan, on Friday sentenced two men, Mustapha Abubakar, 32, and Bashar Shehu, 25, to four years imprisonment each for attempting to steal a motorcycle. The Chief Magistrate, Mr Oladele Adisa, found the two convicts guilty after they changed their plea from not guilty to guilty. Abubakar, a security man, and Shehu, both residents of Sabo area of Ibadan, were first arraigned on Aug. 27, 2018. They both pleaded not guilty to the two-count charge and were granted bail. They, however, could not perfect their bail conditions. The prosecutor, Sgt. Opeyemi Olagunju, had told the court that the convicts conspired and attempted to steal a Honda motorcycle with Reg. No AGG 252 UA. “The said motorcycle, valued at N200,000, is the property of one Mr Olumide Awoseemo,” he said. The prosecutor added that the offences were committed sometime in July 2018 at about 1:00 a.m. opposite the Oyo State High Court premises, Ring Road, Ibadan. He said the offences contravened the provisions of Sections 509 and 516 of the Criminal Code Cap 38, Vol.II, Laws of Oyo State 2000.

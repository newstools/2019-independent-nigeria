Lagos – Bantu FC of Lesotho coach, James Madidilane, is not giving up hope of turning the table against Rangers International of Enugu in the return leg of the CAF Confederation Cup Play-off tie billed for Enugu on Sunday, January 20. Madidilane believes that they can get an away win on Sunday and repay Rangers back in their coins as they did in the first leg last week. He reckons that following his side’s 2-1 loss during the first leg, their underdog status takes a lot of pressure off them, while the pressure will be on Rangers. He stressed that they were still on course to create history in Lesotho football by qualifying for the group stages of a continental soccer event for the first time in the interlocked country’s history. “We are not scared of Rangers, but we respect them like we respected other teams. We have a good team which can win; if they minimise the mistakes and convert our chances. “It would mean a lot to our team as Bantu Football club and also for the nation to see a club from Lesotho going through to the group stages. “Bantu have a chance to write history in Lesotho football. It’s not going to be easy but we have worked in a way that we get the positive result”, said the South Africa ex-international. It will be recalled that Bantu pulled a late goal back against Rangers in the first leg at the 7,000 capacity Leshoboro Seeiso Sports Complex, Mafeteng, such that Madidilane believes the reverse fixture can go in his team’s favour. Having led Bantu to back to back league titles in his two seasons at the club, the 32-year-old Madidilane has his sights on achieving what no other club side from Lesotho has done. The Mafeteng-based club had fallen in previous outings in the CAF Champions League in 2015 and 2018. Though they were able to progress past the preliminary round in this season’s league, they lost to AS Vita of Congo in the first round.

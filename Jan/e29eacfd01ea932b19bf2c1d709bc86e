Nathaniel Clyne is on the verge of completing a six-month loan move to Bournemouth as the defender looks for more game time. The 27-year-old has found himself on the fringes of Jurgen Kloppâ€™s squad having started just one game in the Premier League this season. With Trent Alexander-Arnold making the right back position his own, Clyne has had to sit on the sidelines and wait for his chance.

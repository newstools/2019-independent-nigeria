OSOGBO – The National Orientation Agency (NOA), Osun State Directorate has embarked on sensitisation programme for electorate on how to avoid invalid votes during the Presidential and National Assembly Election holding next month. The agency drew people from all segments of the society for enlightenment on how to vote properly without recording too many void votes during the coming general elections. Addressing the gathering at the programme held in Osogbo, the state Director of NOA, Mrs. Yomi Olasinde said the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had nullified many votes in previous elections as a result wrong voting. She added that millions of votes are wasted due to incorrect voting in the election, this is a matter of concern to NOA and every well-meaning Nigerian. She said: “Subsequently elections, including the last Osun state gubernatorial election indicated that Nigerians were or are still ignorant of how to vote properly. “This situation is further compounded by the number of political parties in Nigeria now, which is 91. Thus, we need to be very cautious with this high number of parties on the ballot paper.

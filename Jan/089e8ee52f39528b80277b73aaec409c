LAGOS – Law alone cannot end exploitation by the power companies in the country without sustained mass action of electricity consumers to resist the exercise, Coalition for Affordable and Regular Electricity (CARE) has said. Chinedu Bosah, National Coordinator of the Group, who disclosed this yesterday in a statement in reaction to the House of Representatives passage of the bill criminalising estimated electricity billing, said labour and pro-labour organisations should lead the resistance against the exploitation. He added that placing electricity, which is one of the major sector of the economy in the hands of the private companies was a violation of Chapter 2 (Section 16) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) that mandated the major sectors of the economy to be publicly owned to avoid undermining of public interest and to shun concentration of too much wealth or the major means of production and exchange in the hands of few people. He advocated the need for the power sector to be renationalised and placed under democratic control and management of workers and consumers in order to guarantee regular supply and forestall corrupt practices inefficiency and extortion. Commending the passing of the bill criminalising estimated billing by the House of Representatives, Bosah implored the Senate to pass the bill speedily and if the President refuses assent, the National Assembly should override him.

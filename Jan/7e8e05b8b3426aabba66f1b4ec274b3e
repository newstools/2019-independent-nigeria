Lagos – The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) on Tuesday expressed concern over the burgling of the property of former Nigeria captain, Nwankwo Kanu, with valuables such as medals, plaques and trophies carted away in the heartbreaking infraction. The burglary happened less than a week after he attended the African Football Awards ceremony in Dakar, Senegal. “Our superstar and former captain is in intense pain at this period, and we empathise with him. This is a tragedy. Losing precious possessions like medals, trophies and plaques can be heartbreaking. “We respectfully call on the Nigeria Police and other security agencies to work hard at unraveling the perpetrators of this nefarious act. “Kanu worked very hard from a humble beginning to accumulate whatever he has today and to earn those precious valuables’,” NFF President, Mr. Amaju Pinnick, said in Lagos. Pinnick insisted the thieves should at least have considered the charitable works of the former Nigeria captain, in helping young Nigerians with heart defects to overcome their medical conditions, before carrying out their dastardly act. “Kanu brought immense joy and celebration to many homes across Nigeria, Africa and the world, while playing for the Golden Eaglets that won the FIFA World Cup, the U-23 team that he captained to Olympic gold in Atlanta in 1996 and the Super Eagles for which he featured at three FIFA World Cup finals. “He also served several top Clubs in world football, giving them and their fans nothing but immeasurable joy. He has also been spending heavily, through his Kanu Heart Foundation (KHF), in getting medical attention for young Africans with heart defects to be cured and live normal lives. “He does not deserve this cruel fate. Our confidence in Nigeria Police and indeed other security agencies to hunt down these criminals is unshaken. “We stand with Kanu at this low moment and we believe he will overcome and put the sad incident behind him soonest.”

Ilorin – Kwara State government has refuted claims that it diverted funds of the local governments in the state. The governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state, Abdulrahman Abdulrasaq, had alleged that the state governor, Abdulfatah Ahmed, and his boss diverted the local government allocations and that accounted for poverty in the local government areas of the state. He had said this while reacting to the alleged claim of the governor that the hardship in the local governments was due to the worsening economic situation of the country under administration of President Muhammad Buhari. But, the government, in a statement, described the APC governorship candidate’s claim as uninformed and false, clarifying that it neither diverts nor otherwise interferes with the local government finances. The government, in the statement, signed by Muyidee Akorede, a media aide to the governor, said local government funds are administered, without its interference, by the respective executive chairpersons through the Joint Account Allocation Committee (JAAC) and based on parameters set by law. The statement explained that while the state-local government joint projects account accelerated infrastructure development at local levels, the scheme was stopped years ago following the sustained reductions in federal allocation on account of drop in global oil prices. The scheme, it said, could therefore not be responsible for the current challenges referred to by the candidate. It reads: “The government also rejected the candidate’s claim that the joint project account was responsible for the low level of development and poverty at the local government level. On the contrary, it said, the drop in federal allocation to local government councils caused salary arrears and the unfortunate hardship being experienced by local government workers and pensioners.

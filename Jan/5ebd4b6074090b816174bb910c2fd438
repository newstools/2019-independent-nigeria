LAGOS – Even as speculations have continued to be high on the possible destination of out-of-favour Chelsea winger, Victor Moses, Turkish giants, Fernebahce, are reportedly tempting the retired Super Eagles star with a whooping N1.59 billion (£3.38 million) to join them. The hefty offer has now spurred confidence among top shots at Fenerbahce that Moses will jettison all rivals in England and sign for the Turkish Super Lig club instead. The offer becomes inevitable, as Moses prefers joining a modest club in the English Premier League (EPL), because he wants to be close to his family in England. With equally exciting offers coming his way from Crystal Palace, Huddersfield Town, Fulham and Cardiff City, Fenerbahce know they have to virtually break the bank to get the enterprising winger. With that in mind, Fenerbahce are ready to pay Moses’ entitlements in full until the end of the season to pull off the deal. That is, even before kicking the ball, he would have all his monies paid into his account. Moses extended his contract with Chelsea in March 2017 and had a pay bill of £130,000 per week inserted into his pay check, which is what Fernebahce will now have to accept in order to lure him to Istanbul.

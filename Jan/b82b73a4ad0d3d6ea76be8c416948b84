LAGOS – The President of Aviation Round Table (ART), Dr. Gabriel Olowo yesterday condemned the Federal Government for earmarking N8.5bn for the suspended national carrier project, Nigeria Air in the 2019 budget proposal to the National Assembly. Olowo specifically criticised the government for setting aside the sum of N500m for Transaction Advisers in the budget, saying that a little of such an amount of money if allocated to technical professionals in the country, would give the government appropriate advice on how to go about the birth of a befitting national carrier for the nation. Olowo, stated this at the launch of a book ‘The Learned Commander,’ authored by Capt. Dele Ore, an erstwhile Director of Operations of the defunct national carrier, Nigeria Airways. Olowo insisted that the government was not following the right path in establishing a new national carrier for the country and urged it to consultant locally from professionals in the sector on how to re-establish a new national airline for Nigeria. “I read it somewhere that the Federal Government proposed another N8.5bn for the establishment of a new national carrier for Nigeria in the 2019 budget proposal to the National Assembly. Out of this money, N500m was set aside for Transaction Advisers. “If you give the N500m to people like Dele Ore and co, they will advice you better on how to have a befitting national carrier. However, ART as a body will continue to fight for the interest of the former staff of Nigeria Airways. We will continue to drum it to the ears of the government that what is due to them is paid”, he said Also speaking in an interview with journalists, Capt. Ore, expressed sadness over the liquidation of the airline almost 16 years later, saying that the staff were poorly treated by the government.

Lagos – Nigeria and Villarreal of Spain striker, Samuel Chukwueze is optimistic that they can beat Real Madrid in Thursday’s La Liga match (today) and wants the victory as a New Year gift. Chukwueze believes they have what it takes to shock their high-profile visitors, since he is believed to be on the starting lineup for the game. Chukwueze, who has been linked with Arsenal, has scored six goals in all competitions for his Spanish club this season. “They are a good side with lots of world-class players but big names don’t play football and hopefully we can surprise them and give our fans a perfect New Year present”, Chukwueze twitted on his account. Three wins, six draws and seven defeats is the record for Villarreal this season, with only 15 points, which has left them in 18th position after 16 matches of the 2018-19 campaign. It has been a desperately disappointing season for the team, who were forced to sack Javier Calleja, the coach that gave Chukwueze his breakthrough in the team, and Luis Garcia took over at the helm. Garcia has taken charge of two matches since stepping into the position – following a 2-0 win over Spartak Moscow in the Europa League with a 2-2 draw against Huesca in La Liga just before the international break.

Lagos – Abdullahi Biffo, the Katsina United coach, has reiterated his commitment committed to the game of football in general and his club in particular after regaining his freedom from abductors, who kidnaped him on January 7, 2019. It will be recalled that the incident, which happened just when the resumption of the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) was in sight, led to the postponement of fixtures involving Katsina United, particularly their week one match against Rivers United. The abductors demanded about N15 million but DAILY INDEPENDENT gathered that an undisclosed sum was paid for his release. Meanwhile, while Biffo was expected to lead his charges against Remo Stars in Osogbo on Sunday, a source close to the coach confided to our correspondent that the coach had sounded undaunted and unperturbed, vowing to continue with his task, even as some people have averred that the trauma associated with the sad incident would affect him. “No, he is very strong; in fact, if you see him, you will understand that coach is a very strong guy. He is not disturbed by the incident. He has moved ahead but will be very careful. Football and coaching runs in his blood and he has vowed to continue stronger,” said the source to our correspondent.

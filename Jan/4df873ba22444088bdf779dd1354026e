After long injury layoff, Tyronne Ebuehi, Super Eagles defender, is set to rejoin his colleagues at both his club and the national team. Ebuehi may rejoin the team ahead of the last African Nations Cup qualifier against Seychelles and the friendly matches lined up as preparatory games for the AFCON. Also likely to rejoin the Eagles is Shehu Abdullahi, who played his first game in three months at the weekend. Ebuehi played for the Super Eagles at the Russia 2018 World Cup, but he has been kept away from the team by a left anterior cruciate ligament injury he copped in a pre-season game for his club, Benfica, against Juventus. Last year, Rohr sent a fitness trainer to work with the former Holland junior international, who, according to sources, would be checked out by Super Eagles’ doctors before the team reconvenes for the game against Seychelles. Rohr said that his crew had been monitoring all the players available for the national team with a view to improving the squad. He said, “It is a moment to monitor our players to see if they are fit and of course have some news also from our injured players. “Tyrone has started training again but he can’t start playing. The same thing applies to Ahmed Musa, who has an injury at the moment.” Also coming back from an injury lay off is Bursaspor right back, Shehu, who played his first game in three months at the weekend. Shehu suffered a thigh muscle rupture during an AFCON qualifier against Libya in October. The 25-year-old came on in the 80th minute as Bursaspor shared the spoils with a 1-1 draw against Kayserispor at the weekend.

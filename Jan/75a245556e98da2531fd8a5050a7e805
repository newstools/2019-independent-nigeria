A man has been charged with flying a drone near Heathrow Airport on Christmas Eve. George Rusu, 38, allegedly used a drone on a field near one of the two runways at Britainâ€™s busiest airport on 24 December. The alleged incident happened just three days after Gatwick fully reopened following three days of flight cancellations and delays, affecting about 140,000 passengers, caused by drone sightings.

  Samir Nasri has joined West Ham for the remainder of the season. Nasri has spent some time training with the club and he has been offered a deal that includes the option to extend his stay beyond the end of the current campaign. The former Manchester City and Arsenal player, who has been without a club since leaving Turkish side Antalyaspor in January, is free to resume playing on January 1 after completing an 18-month doping ban and he is looking forward to getting started with the Hammers. “You choose a club because of the ambition, and I think that West Ham has everything to be one of the biggest clubs in London, for sure,” Nasri said. “I mean, 60,000 people every game at home, we play in the Olympic Stadium. The training ground is there and you have owners who want to invest and have a good team. Everything is there to be doing great things. “Coming back to the most competitive league in the world, with a team full of ambition with a manager that I know. It’s the best job in the world, and I’m really excited about it.” Nasri won the Premier League under manager Manuel Pellegrini at Manchester City and the Chilean has expressed his delight at signing the 31-year-old. “He is a player I obviously know well from our time together at Manchester City and I am happy to be working with him again,” Pellegrini said. “He has been working very hard here in recent weeks to build up his fitness and condition after a long period without playing, and he is now very determined to return to his best. “Samir will give us another dimension in our attacking play. He is a very technical player, with excellent quality on the ball, and the ability to create big moments in important matches. “He already has very good experience of the Premier League and we hope that he will have a positive impact on the team between now and the end of the season.”

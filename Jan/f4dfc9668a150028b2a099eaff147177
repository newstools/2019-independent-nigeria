AKURE – Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, on Thursday charged Nigerians to follow the example of Frederick Fasehun, the late founder of the Oodua People’s Congress (OPC). Osinbajo gave the charge during the funeral service organized for Faseun at the Saint Stephen’s Anglican Cathedral Church, Oke Aluko, Ondo City, Ondo State. He said Fasehun was committed to national unity and democratic development throughout his lifetime. The vice president, who advised the people in the church to always do good while alive, noted that the late pro-democracy activist would be remembered for his patriotism and contributions to national development. Osinbajo said the late OPC founder would specifically be remembered for the role he played in the struggle for the restoration of democracy for which he suffered for 20 months at Ikoyi Prison. Describing Fasehun as a dogged fighter and a highly principled personality, Osinbajo said the late nationalist was a brilliant medical doctor, who lived a life of charity. Ondo State Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, also described Fasehun as a unique and special leader who served the nation wholeheartedly. Akeredolu, who said the late nationalist suffered for the progress of the Yoruba race, added that founding OPC was one of the legacies he left behind. In his sermon, Archbishop of Ondo Province, Anglican Communion, Most Rev. Gabriel Akinbiyi, described Fasehun as a patriotic Nigerian whose lifespan was devoted to the liberation of his people regardless of religious and political affiliations. Bishop Akinbiyi said death was an inevitable end for all human beings irrespective of position or status. Other dignitaries at the occasion included Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi; former governor of Ondo State, Dr. Olusegun Mimiko and Minister of State for Niger Delta, Prof. Claudius Daramola, among others.

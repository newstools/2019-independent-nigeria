JOSEPH UNDU LAGOS – Prof. James Ayatse, the Tor Tiv and chairman, Benue State Council of Traditional Rulers, has decried the alleged Federal Government inability to fulfil its promise to provide shelter to Internally Displaced People (IDPs) in Benue State one year after they were chased out of their ancestral homes by invading armed herdsmen. According to a statement signed by his special assistant on Media, Freddie Adamgbe, Ayatse said this during a dialogue for peaceful election jointly organized by the National Peace Committee and the United Nations in Makurdi recently. The Tor Tiv lamented that, “The Federal Government is yet to fulfil its promise of providing shelter for the Internally Displaced Persons currently residing in camps to return to their ancestral lands after their every possession, including homes, crops and life savings had been destroyed.” He also called on the international community and individuals for urgent need to curb the humanitarian crisis bedeviling Benue, which is the acclaimed food basket of the nation. He said, “The Federal Government is too slow.” Speaking further on the readiness of Tiv people for the elections, Tor Tiv said, “The Tiv nation is ever ready than before in adhering strictly to all the guidelines aimed at delivering peaceful and credible polls. With the preparedness of the umpire body, the Independent National Electoral Commission, 2019 looks more promising than 2015.” The Begha u Tiv, however, called on the INEC to remain neutral in conducting elections that would be acceptable all both locally and internationally, adding that it was only by so doing that the country would witness peace and development. He also expressed reservation about the renewed influx of herdsmen and continued attacks on the Benue farming communities.

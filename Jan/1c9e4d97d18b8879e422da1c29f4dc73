FC Barcelona sporting director Eric Abidal has admitted that they are waiting on a decision from Frenkie De Jong as they go head-to-head with Paris Saint-Germain for the Dutchman’s signature. The Ajax wonderkid has been pursued by the biggest clubs in Europe as they look to secure one of the most talented young players around, with Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola confessing last week that they had probably been priced out of a move for the player. Discussing the issue, Guardiola refused to speak specifically about City’s pursuit of De Jong, but said: “If you are the only one who want players it’s easy. But if you want one and many, many clubs want him it’s more complicated, especially if it’s Madrid or Barcelona. “Normally when you are involved with Madrid and Barcelona you are going to lose.” But Barca themselves fear losing out to PSG.

Abidal, speaking at the unveiling of new signing Kevin-Prince Boateng, said: “That’s a question more for the player than fo me. “He will make his decision, we can just wait, like everyone.” De Jong will spend the rest of the season on loan at Ajax regardless, as he has committed to staying with the Amsterdam side until the summer. Teammate Matthijs De Ligt, a target for a number of top European clubs also, will do the same as the club chases down an Eredivisie title. Barcelona are not expected to do more business this month after securing the loan signing of Boateng from Sassuolo.

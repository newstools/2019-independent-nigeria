Ariana Grande was left embarrassed after fans point out that her Japanese palm tattoo which was meant to read “7 Rings” actually translates to “shichirin” – a Japanese style barbecue grill. To celebrate the success of her latest single 7 Rings, Ariana decided to get the title etched on her palm in Japanese Kanji character symbols. Sharing a snap of the finished inking on her Instagram page, Ariana wrote: “This felt super good @kanenavasard jk (everyone thinks this is a fake hand but it’s indeed… my hand.” However, fans were quick to point out the design was actually missing a symbol, and therefore translates differently. “Ariana Grande’s new tattoo means Japanese style bbq grill, not 7 rings. If you want to know about (the symbols) just google ‘SHICHIRIN’,” one wrote, while another added: “Imagine getting bbq grill tattooed on your palm.” Ariana then responded to her critics, insisting she wouldn’t have managed to have another symbol added to the tattoo because its placement meant it was incredibly painful to have done. “Indeed, I left out (the other symbol) which should have gone in between,” she wrote. “It hurt like f**k n still looks tight. I wouldn’t have lasted one more symbol lmao (laugh my a*s off). But this spot also peels a ton and won’t last so if I miss it enough I’ll suffer thru the whole thing next time.” Poking fun at the mistake, Ariana added: “Also… huge fan of tiny bbq grills.” She later deleted the initial tattoo picture and her tweet responding to the misspelling. Ariana isn’t the only star to have had a misspelled tattoo. Britney Spears had hoped to have the word “mysterious” inked on her hip in Chinese characters, but an error means she actually has “strange” tattooed there instead. Meanwhile, actress Ashley Greene angered grammar nerds by having “lifes a dance” tattooed on her foot – without the apostrophe.

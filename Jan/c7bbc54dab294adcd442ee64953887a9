LAGOS – A Dentsu Aegis Network’s latest forecast has predicted that the Unite Kingdom (UK) is expected to experience the highest growth in advertising expenditure across Western Europe this year at 6.1 per cent, as Brexit causes short-termism amongst clients. The report reveals that the growth equates to £22.2 billion and is 1.4 per cent points higher than the company’s last predictions posted in June 2018, when it expected 4.7 per cent growth this year. Dentsu Aegis Network also expects a 7.1 per cent rise in adspend in 2020. The report refers to the UK as a resilient market with a relatively buoyant outlook. “Concerns around the impact of Brexit and the general data protection regulation have yet to manifest in falling advertiser confidence,” the report said. Growth is down to a 10.9 per cent rise in digital adspend and the UK having the highest share of digital spend globally at 64 per cent. TV adspend is set to slow to -0.4 per cent, with a return to growth in 2020 to 2 per cent. Jo Sutherland, Carat’s UK chief executive noted: “We have a raft of clients that will be affected by Brexit, but it’s swayed the conversations to digital and a short-term outlook. The downside is that the conversations about brand-building are happening less.” She added that there is a “swing to more accountable media”, allowing agencies and clients to monitor return on investment and adjust the messaging in ads quickly. Sutherland explained that its data-driven agency arm, Merkle, has been key in helping with this. In 2018, UK ads spend grew 6.5 per cent, an upward revision from 4.2 per cent. Dentsu Aegis Network attributed this to “a stronger-than-expected start” over the first half of the year around the football World Cup.

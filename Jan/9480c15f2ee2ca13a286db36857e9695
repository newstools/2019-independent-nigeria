Rohr reflected on Kalu’s few days so far with the Nigerian national team and stressed that the youngster adds so much depth to the Nigerian national squad with his versatility qualities, which include defensive efforts from the front. Kalu’s versatile abilities showed in November 2018 when he played as a wing-back for the Eagles in a 1-1 draw away to South Africa during a crucial 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier. That was his fourth match for the Eagles and Kalu has started all of Nigeria’s competitive games after the 2018 World Cup, with a goal and two assists to show for what Rohr calls rare qualities. Rohr eulogized Kalu further, saying: “He’s an amazing player. He’s integrated into my team as if he’s always been there. He has intrinsic qualities – he is fast and has ability to defend. ”We played 3-5-2 in South Africa where he scored our only goal, while managing to defend very well. ”He knows how to attack but he never hesitates to fall back to the defense. In the team, he can also play on the left wing when playing 4-2-3-1.” Nigerian Wrestlers Face Daunting Hurdles In Global Requirements.

The Newspaper Proprietors’ Association of Nigeria (NPAN) has condemned the Sunday raid on the Abuja, Lagos and Maiduguri offices of Daily Trust Newspapers by officers of the Nigerian Army. This action, which saw the arrest of an editor and reporter of the newspaper as well as seizure of some computer hardware by the team, disrupted the news organization’s operations until the Federal Government ordered an end to the siege at about 9:30 pm. It would be recalled that earlier, the Army in a statement had explained that the action was precipitated by the newspaper’s violation of the Official Secret Act since they’d allegedly given prior notice of military strategy and tactics to Boko Haram insurgents. Describing the Army’s action as a “display of raw power and emotion over due process” as well as “reminiscent of the military era brutalisation of the press and the people,” NPAN said the siege to the organisations premises was “clearly unconstitutional, without due process and an act of self help.” The declarations, which were contained in a statement signed by Feyi Smith, NPAN’s Executive Secretary, and made available to Daily Independent on Monday, added that by carting away computer hardware over the alleged infraction, the raiders showed a poor appreciation of the IT advancement in today’s globalised world. “It showed a poor appreciation of the advancement in information dissemination in the global village where news is disseminated at the touch of a keyboard and not necessarily in a fixed address,” NPAN said. “This is 2019 and those who gave the vexatious order ought to know better.” The association maintained that where an infraction is alleged, the best option is to follow due process and civility; not knee-jerk, not intimidation and spread of fear in the civil society.”

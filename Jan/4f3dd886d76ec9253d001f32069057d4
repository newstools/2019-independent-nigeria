The Cleveland Cavaliers finally broke their 12-game losing streaking against the Lakers in Los Angeles on Sunday — while Khloe Kardashian was in the stands cheering on her man Tristan Thompson. Coincidence? She thinks not! Khloe and TT were leaving Craig’s after the game — all smiles in great moods — where they jokingly took the credit for the big 101-95 win over the LeBron-less Lakers at Staples Center. In all seriousness, Tristan had a solid game, posting a double-double (15 points, 14 rebounds) — and he’s having a pretty solid year overall.No sign of their daughter True out last night — but there was definitely baby on brain for our photog … who asked the couple if they were planning on having any more adorable kids in the future.

Lagos – ASEC Mimosas on Saturday at the Stade Félix Houphouët-Boigny in Cote d’Ivoire’s biggest city, Abidjan piped Lobi Stars of Nigeria 1-0 in the 2018/19 CAF Champions League match. The Ivorian giants with the victory bounced back to contention after they succumbed to a 5-2 defeat to Moroccan side, Wydad Casablanca away in their opening Group A game while Lobi Stars failed to repeat their feat which saw them beat Mamelodi Sundowns of South Africa 2-1 at home last week. Algerian match referee, Mustapha Ghorbal picked an infringement against Lobi Stars in the penalty area and the resultant penalty kick was neatly taken by Ahmed Herve Diomade in the 38th minute for the only goal of the match. Despite the defeat, Lobi Stars are still ahead of ASEC Mimosas on the table with goals difference as the two teams have three points each. The outcome of the group’s other match between Mamelodi Sundowns and Wydad Casablanca will determine who tops the table after two matches each.

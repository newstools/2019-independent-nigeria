A powerful regional body of African states has called for a recount in the contested presidential election in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The unexpected move underlines growing worries that instead of marking a turning point for the troubled country, the 30 December Vote and the deepening political crisis it has triggered will instead lead to a slide into anarchy and violence. Such concerns are urgent for regional powers well aware that extensive conflict in the vast and mineral-rich DRC has the potential to destabilise significant parts of central, east and southern Africa. A civil war between 1997 and 2002 killed 5 million people and drew in all neighbouring states. The surprise victor of the election was Félix Tshisekedi, leader of the country’s main opposition party. Tshisekedi beat opposition politician Martin Fayulu by a narrow margin. However Fayulu, a widely respected former business executive and parliamentarian, that he in fact won by a landslide and that Tshisekedi struck a deal with Joseph Kabila to be declared victor. Fayulu’s claims have been bolstered by DRC’s influential Catholic church, which deployed 40,000 election monitors on the day of the election and has stated that its data showed a different winner to that announced by the electoral commission.

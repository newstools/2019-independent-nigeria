ASABA – Alarmed by the 465,317 Permanent Voter Cards (PVC) that are not yet collected out of registered 2,823,161 persons, Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State has appealed to those who have not collected theirs to do so. He made the appeal on Thursday in Ughelli, Oleh and Ozoro, headquarters of Ughelli North, Isoko South and North Local Government Areas of the state, insisting that it is in their interest to support Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). He also urged them to defend their votes. He said while the party was campaigning round the 25 local government areas in the state, opposition parties were sleeping and planning to use thugs and security agencies to disrupt the election. Isoko traditional Rrulers in collaboration with Isoko Development Union (IDU) also endorsed Okowa for second term. According to him, Ughelli North is hot politically, saying that the people give so many votes but always find it difficult to see the results. “With our majority votes, there is no need to fight. We are in charge of the state, nobody can take it away from us, we have to gather strength, go from house to house campaign,” Okowa assured. Chairman of the party in the state, Kingsley Esiso, said there was no other party in the state apart from PDP, stating that Nigerians were tired of All Progressive Congress (APC) government which had brought poverty, hunger, injustice, nepotism and visionless. He lamented that a particular governorship candidate, who comes back every four years to contest after losing, had become a serial contestant despite that he does not have anything to offer the people of Delta State. Director-general of his campaign organization, Chief Funkekeme Solomon, stated that the various council party chairmen should make sure the crowd translated to votes in order for PDP to carry the day.

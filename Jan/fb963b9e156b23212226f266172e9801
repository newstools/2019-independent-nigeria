Abuja – President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki yesterday cried out that his life and that of his family members are in danger. He said that the Inspector General of Police, Ibrahim Idris should be held responsible if anything untoward happens to members of his family and himself. Addressing newsmen in Abuja, the Director General of Atiku Abubakar Presidential Campaign Organisation, said that he decided to cry especially now that campaigns have started. He further pointed out that in the last six months, the IGP has posted three different Commissioners of Police to Kwara State, adding that now that campaigns have started, he would not know the instruction Idris has given to the police command in the state. Saraki, who is the number 3rd person in the country, said, “I call you today to bring to your attention the sad development in my home state, Kwara State, and the role of the security agencies in giving cover to people who are unleashing violence on our people because they are surprised and cannot understand how and why the people continue to give massive and overwhelming support to the PDP across the state. “The police have continued to show undisguised hostility to me and my supporters in Kwara State and this latest round of violence is part of efforts to jeopardise and undermine my personal security and that of my immediate and larger family. “Three incidents will illustrate what I am saying to you. Yesterday, after the APC concluded their campaigns in Ilorin, some of their supporters and thugs moved around town  and in areas  like Adewole/Adeta, Ile Otan and Ubandawaki/Pakata where they saw our people gathered holding their weekly ward meeetings, they disrupted the meetings by shouting their party slogan and when our people responded by mentioning our own slogan, they fired gun shots into their midst in Adewole/Adeta. They also inflicted matchete cuts on some of them. As a result of this attack, two people suffered bullet wounds,” he said.

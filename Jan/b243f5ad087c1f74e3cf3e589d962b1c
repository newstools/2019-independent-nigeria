GUSAU – Dr. Bello Mohammed Matawalle, the governorship candidate in Zamfara State on Wednesday flagged off his campaign in Kaura Namoda town, promising to restore peace and security in the state if given the mandate by the electorate. Speaking at the rally, Matawalle noted that he was the Chairman, Committee on Public Safety in the House of Representatives, saying that he has gathered enough experience on how to handle the insecurity situation ravaging in the state since 2011. He said that the crimes under various senses and fashion were being perpetrated by unemployed youths who for many years had no tangible means of livelihoods and were roaming about the streets aimlessly. He noted that if there were job opportunities, the youths would be self-reliant and would disengage their minds from all the heinous crimes as they would have something doing to sustain themselves and their relations. He explained that most of the youths were employable saying that there was no work for them to do forcing them to take to armed banditry. The former federal lawmaker stressed that most of the youths were good in agricultural activities pointing out that as agriculture was no longer the viable source of the state economy, they had to abandon the sector for only women. Matawalle assured that his administration would ensure food security in the state promising to make farming the pride of the state which he said the state was noted for before 1999. He explained that he would revitalise agricultural sector to make it the source of the state economy rather than relying fully on the federal monthly allocations coming into the state. He, however, vowed to rehabilitate the youths by making the state youths skills acquisition programme very effective and functional so that the youths who could not further their education could learn some trades for self-reliance.

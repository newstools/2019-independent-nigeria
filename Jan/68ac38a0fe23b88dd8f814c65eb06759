Lagos – As this year’s general election draws closer, Samson Benjamin, the national leader of All Blending Party (ABP), has called for the greater participation of the Nigerian youths in politics. Benjamin regretted that for the greater part of Nigeria’s political life, the youths have been completely sidelined by a few elders who have monopolized the political space to the exclusion of the youths, who have new ideas. This, according to him, has denied the nation the necessary energy and youth exuberance that should drive the development of the nation. He said this at the weekend in Badagry, Lagos State, when he presented various candidates of his party, who are contesting for various elective positions in Badagry to Oba Akran of Badagry, His Royal Highness, Oba Aholu Menu Toyi, and the Alapa of Apa, His Royal Highness, Oba Oyekan Adekanmi Ilufemiloye, at their palaces for royal blessing. The candidates included Gantin Bose Veronica, Basit Senapon Badaru and Agosa Elizabeth Umoru for Badagry Federal Constituency and Badagry State Constituencies 1 and 2, respectively. He said that his party, ABP, will make sure that the Nigerian youths are given their rightful place in the country’s political space if elected, adding that the ages of the party’s candidates testifies to the party’s belief and confidence in the Nigerian youths. He regretted that Nigeria has continued to recycle the same crop of leaders over the years, saying that this has prevented the nation from moving forward and called on the people of Badagry to vote for his party’s candidates in the elections ahead. He promised that if his get into power; it will implement youth-oriented policies and programmes. He, therefore, called on Nigerian youth to vote for the candidates of the party.

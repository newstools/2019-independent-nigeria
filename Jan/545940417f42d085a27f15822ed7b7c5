Ibadan – Akeem Olatunji, the Director for Public Communication, New Media and Tertiary Institutions of the Senator Olufemi Lanlehin Campaign Organisation, has said that his support for the Africa Democratic Congress (ADC) governorship candidate (Lanlehin) was in the best interest of the state and the Africa Democratic Congress (ADC). He also explained that his support for the House of Representative member representing Oluyole Federal Constituency, Olusumbo Olugbemi, was also in the best interest of the constituency and the party. Giving reasons for his support for Olugbemi, Olatunji said the ongoing road construction linking Olomi, Aiyegun, Olode and Latunde all in Oluyole local government areas in Ibadan to Ijebu-Igbo was facilitated by the reps, with assistance from Senator Monsurat Sunmonu within three and half years of the first four years tenure. Olomi-Olojuoro-Ijebu’gbo road was the first intercity road linking Ibadan to other towns and has been neglected for more than four decades until Hon Olusumbo Olugbemi used all connection within his reach to attract the multi billion naira project to Oluyole. “To the glory of God, the road project is already under construction. The good people of Oluyole cannot afford to start all over again as benefits attached to the new road project are enormous starting from opening up of our hitherto rural communities to unprecedented development, boost in agriculture practice and employment opportunities for our teeming unemployed youths as well as industrialization prospects.”

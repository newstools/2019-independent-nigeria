In a bid to improve production of ecportable products in the country, two firms – D Four Metals and Plastona Limited have entered into a joint venture agreement to establish an ultra-modern $3 million smelting plant and a refinery in Jos, Plateau State. According to the firms, the move by both organisations was coming on the heels of the present administration’s policy of adding value to products and services before they are being exported to the world. Mr. E. Collins, the Chief Executive Officer, Plastona Limited, in a statement, disclosed that the plant, which is expected to commence operations in the third quarter of 2019, would have the capacity to produce 11,000 tons of lead ingots annually, a metal material required for further processing in steel production. He added that setting up the facility would create lots of job opportunities for the nation’s teeming unemployed youths, while also generating foreign exchange via exports of its finished products. He said Plastona with offices in London, would deploy the latest use of blast furnace technology, saying that most of the equipment would be brought in from China where the company’s technical partners were based. He pointed out that when completed and fully operational, the facility would help Nigeria save hard-earned foreign exchange she spends on importing raw materials the country has competitive and comparative advantage of producing. Mr. Olusegun Oyalana, the Chief Executive Officer, D four Metals noted that the total investment over the 12 months would be about $3m, stressing that the plant was expected to breakeven within 18 months after construction.

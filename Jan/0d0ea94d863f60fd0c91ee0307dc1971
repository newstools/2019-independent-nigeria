A number of high profile athletes have registered for this year’s Access Bank Lagos City Marathon holding in Lagos. It was learnt that as much as 35 Gold, 13 Silver and 12 Bronze Labelled Runners have registered for the event. Yusuf Alli, the General Manager for the Marathon, who expressed delight at the interest shown by the big names to run at the event, noted that the Marathon has surpassed the requirement for a Bronze Label and has done enough to earn even a Gold Label from the IAAF/AIMS. He predicted that a new course record might be set at this year’s marathon due to the stronger field of athletes that would be on parade. “This year’s marathon will definitely be better than the previous ones, the quality of elite athletes coming have improved a great deal, so we are confident of a good show,” he assured. Among big names expected are David Barmasai Tumo from Kenya who won the 2011 Dubai Marathon, his compatriots, Jacob Kibet Chulyo, Moses Kigen Kipkosgei as well as Samuel Gebremichael who now does his thing for Australia.

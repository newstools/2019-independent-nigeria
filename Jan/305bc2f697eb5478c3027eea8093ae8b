LAGOS – The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) yesterday said the nation’s petroleum industry investment climate is severely threatened as a result of politicians use of the Corporation as Launchpad for political attacks against opponents ahead of the 2019 general elections in the country. The development, according to the Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division, Mr. Ndu Ughamadu, was not only a disservice to the overall national interest, but also inimical to the national economy, given NNPC’s pivotal role as cash cow of the nation. He added that the ongoing attempts by politicians to drag the name of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation(NNPC) into the murky arena of partisan politics was a potent danger to the corporation’s business interests, its multi-faceted contract deals and MoUs which should ordinarily be insulated from political brinkmanship, its spokesman said. He explained that while it might be understandable for politicians to seek the hearts and souls of the electorate, attempting the feat by way of dragging NNPC into the fray was unfair and irrational, as the business environment in which it operates is not designed to withstand the shock from such careless and unguarded diatribes. He called on politicians and those canvassing for votes for the impending general elections, to refrain from using NNPC or its top management as cannon fodders as part of their electioneering strategies.

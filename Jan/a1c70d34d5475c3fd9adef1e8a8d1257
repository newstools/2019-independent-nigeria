The National Pension Commission (PenCom) yesterday approved the issuance of a license to Nigerian University Pension Management Company Limited (NUPEMCO) to carry out the business of a Pension Fund Administrator (PFA). The Commission in a statement made available to DAILY INDEPENDENT by Peter Aghahowa, Head Corporate Communication, said: “This approval is consequent upon a detailed evaluation of NUPEMCO’s compliance with the requirements, terms, and conditions stipulated by the Commission. “Like the Nigerian Police Force Pension Fund Administrator, whose mandate is to manage the police pensions within the Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS), the NUPEMCO is expected to run the pension assets of members within its confines but under strict supervision by PenCom in accordance with the extant law”. However, DAILY INDEPENDENT gathered that the granting of the NUPEMCO’s license by the commission is not unconnected with the protracted agitation by the university community to own and manage its own pensions away from the existing PFAs under the Contributory Pension Scheme.

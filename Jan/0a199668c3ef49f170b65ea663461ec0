Zenith Bank, the sponsors of the ongoing Delta State Principals Cup, has charged the remaining 26 teams in the competition to embrace fair play. The bank in partnership with the government of Delta State under Governor Ifeanyi Okowa revived the competition in 2017 to boost grassroots development in the state. The 3rd edition of the tournament organized for secondary schools Delta State will enter intensive stage from January 21 with the zonal elimination series. Group Managing Director of Zenith Bank, Peter Amangbo, during the week advised all the participants of the competition to be fair on and off the pitch. “Players should be friendly with one another because we expect they will meet in future. It is also important for them to demonstrate discipline which is an integral aspect of the game,” said Amangbo. “Officials and all organisers should be fair to the young ones so that a true champion will emerge. The issue of fair play cuts across all those involved in the tournament. We are very proud of this competition and expect the best as the tournament enters crucial stages.”

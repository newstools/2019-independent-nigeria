LAGOS – Rangers International of Enugu may be said to have one leg at the group stage of the 2019 CAF Confederation Cup following a 2-1 win over FC Bantu of Lesotho in the qualifying round of the second tier club competition inside the main bowl of the 1,000-capacity Setsoto Stadium, Maseru, Lesotho. In the match that started with the two sides showing caution in their games, Bright Silas got the curtain raiser for the Flying Antelopes in the 20th minute. While Rangers attempted to increase the tally before the half time, their hosts also made several efforts to level up but the first forty five minutes ended thus. At the commencement of the second half, Bantu proved the better of both sides in the initial exchanges but they were unable to break through the defence of the Nigerian side. In the 84th minute, Rangers doubled their lead through Godwin Aguda. But the hosts responded in the 90th minute through Jokojokwana to reduce the deficit. Meanwhile, the second leg comes up in Enugu next week and Rangers must avoid defeat to advance into the mini league stage.

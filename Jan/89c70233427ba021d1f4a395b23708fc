LAGOS – Nigerian wrestlers have been informed that they face steep obstacles and expectations that they will have to overcome in order to gain global recognition this year. The hurdles have been outlined by the world governing body, which stated that the Nigerian grapplers must attend world championships, continental contests and ranking series. It is only through these routes that the wrestlers would be able to gain points on world rankings after United World Wrestling (UWW) Bureau approved new regulations for the 2019 Ranking Series. World silver medalist, Odunayo Adekuoroye is the most ranked Nigerian wrestler, 9th, in women’s wrestling 57kg cadre, while Commonwealth champion, Blessing Oborududu, is ranked 12th in the 68kg. Two-time commonwealth champion, Aminat Adeniyi is ranked 17th in the 62kg, while Blessing Onyebuchi is rated 17th in the 76kg. UWW’s changes to the 2019 Ranking Series centered on exposure, participation and progress at world and continental championships. The bureau stated in part: “The 2018 World Championships results are the basis of the rankings, as each year the world championships results will be the first points for the following year. “The seeding process for the World Championships and Olympic Games will now also include a field of the top four wrestlers in each weight. “The number of points awarded at a competition will also be impacted by the number of wrestlers entered in each bracket. “Points will be allocated to participating athletes in a weight category and are not transferable to other athletes or weight categories. “Points will also reset after the world championships or Olympic Games with the points from the previous year’s championships or games used for following year’s rankings.”

National Assembly chief Juan Guaido was held by intelligence agents on the way to a political rally, before being released. The opposition leader has declared President Nicolas Maduro’s second term to be illegitimate. The head of Venezuela’s opposition-controlled congress was pulled from his car and briefly detained on Sunday after he stepped up a campaign to oust the country’s unpopular president Nicolas Maduro according to DW.com. “Sebin detains Juan Guaido,” Guaido’s wife tweeted, referring to the state intelligence services. The arrest was confirmed by other lawmakers who were waiting for him at the meeting in the town of Caraballeda. She later posted another message vowing that “the dictatorship will never subdue his Guaido’s fighting spirit.”

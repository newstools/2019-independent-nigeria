The Court of Appeal has denied reports that names of dead and retired judges are on the list of the 250 Judges sworn-in as Chairmen and members of the Election Petition Tribunal. The judges were sworn in on Saturday by the Acting Chief Justice of Nigeria, Tanko Muhammad. The Court of Appeal said the report was false and that the list was drawn with input from Chief Judges of states and the Nigeria Bar Association. Media officer of the court of Appeal, Sa’adatu Kachalla in a statement issued today, Wednesday quotes; “The attention of the Court of Appeal has been drawn to a malicious publication making the round in some portals that the names of 10 dead Judges featured in the list of the 250 Judges sworn-in in January 26, 2019 as Election Petition Tribunal Chairmen and Members. “In view of the above we wish to state that there was no name of a dead or retired Judge on the list we sent to the Supreme Court for the swearing-in ceremony by His Lordship the acting Chief Justice of Nigeria Mr Justice Ibrahim Tanko Muhammad”

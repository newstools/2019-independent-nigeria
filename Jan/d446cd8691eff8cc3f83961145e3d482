Community efforts have been identified as major catalyst for community development in Nigeria. Her Excellency, Chief Mrs. Betty Anyanwu-Akeredolu, Wife of Ondo State Governor, made this assertion during the end of the year town hall meeting at her community, Emeabiam in Owerri West Local Government Area of Imo State, organised by her foundation in conjunction with Ada Emeabiam foundation. Akeredolu stated that gone were the days when communities like Emeabiam, blessed with a lot of natural resources, human resources and had huge economic potential like ecotourism, would fold their hands and wait for government alone to bring development in the area. She regretted that Emeabiam had remained one of the most marginalised and undeveloped communities in Imo State, irrespective of her huge natural endowment and contribution to the state economy, and blamed it on the successive governments in the area. Akeredolu, who is also the apex traditional title holder of the community, ‘Ada Emeabiam II,’ therefore charged the people of Emeabiam to take the bull by the horn and chart the course of a new Emeabiam of their dreams. She however warned that implementation of the resolutions of the town hall should be taken seriously, hence the popular hash tag in the community #NOMOREKARAWUSA, meaning (resolutions must not be taken for granted anymore).

The Head of Shipping, the Nigeria Maritime Administration (NIMASA), South West Zonal Office, Mrs. Carol Aneto, yesterday disclosed that the agency would confidently support produce export through its intervention programme called cargo initiative. Aneto told our correspondent in Lagos that the agency had partnered with the Nigeria Export Promotion bank for the project. Aneto, who doubles as a member of the inter-ministerial committee on Non-oil Export, said due to the capital intensive nature of shipping, that the agency had to intervene to encourage exporters. According to her, the committee was made up of members drawn from the Nigeria Shippers Council, Nigeria Export Promotion Commission and NIMASA. “NIMASA apart from providing security on the waters is piloting an initiative aimed at bolstering the economy through produce export. “Shipping is about export and import of goods and services the prevalent of import variant of the international trade is worrisome and should be changed. “With the support of other agencies in the committee Nigeria will soon change from an import dependent to an export hub thereby creating the much needed job for youth,’’ Aneto said.

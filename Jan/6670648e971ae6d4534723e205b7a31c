ASABA – There is palpable apprehension in Delta State Chapter of the All Progressive Congress, APC, following the judgment by the Appeal Court sitting in Benin, Edo State. The court had Thursday upheld earlier decision of the Federal High Court, Asaba restraining the party from submitting names of candidates to the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, for the forthcoming general elections. The Appeal Court in its ruling Thursday, January 24, 2019, also described the application brought before it by the Chief Great Ogboru/Senator Ovie Omo- Agege’s faction and the Adams Oshiomhole-led National Working Committee (NWC) challenging the lower court’s ruling as lacking in merit and grossly incompetent. Ruling on the case with the suit No. CA/B/541/2018 between APC and AVR vs Chief Cyril Ogodo and others, the Appeal Court also particularly held that the lower court’s ruling of August 17, 2018 on “No Submission of Name to INEC” by both factions of the party is still binding. The news of the ruling has been generating tension across the state leading to APC leaders in the state going into an emergency meeting to avoid another chaotic situation of the likes of Rivers State. However, while reacting to the judgment, the Delta State chapter of the All Progressives Congress, APC, debunked reports that the Court of Appeal, Benin-City, Thursday ruled that the party has no candidate in the state ahead of next month’s general election.

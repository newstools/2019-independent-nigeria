The Nigeria Employers’ Consultative Association (NECA) has voiced its concern at the persistent crowding out of the manufacturing or real sector of the economy from accessing capital at reasonable cost due to increased government borrowing in the domestic market. Mr. Timothy Olawale, the Director-General of NECA, in a chat with our correspondent stated that, ‘’the private sector continues to be crowed out of access to capital at reasonable cost due to the volume of Government’s borrowing in the domestic market. He noted that ‘’the assumptions of the 2019 budget showed that Government might borrow to finance the deficit in the Budget. This is against the background that the Debt management Office had earlier reported that the Federal Government’s domestic debt profit rose to N15.814trillion in September, 2018 from N15.629trillion in June, 2018 (1.19% increase). The Director-General averred that ‘’the 2019 budget has about N1.86 trillion deficit and predicated on revenues in the range of N7 trillion. Both scenarios are threatened by disappointing revenue (notwithstanding the upsurge in the price of crude), which naturally feeds into a wider deficit that will leave government with limited options than to borrow, thereby further shrinking available credit to the private sector.’’ While acknowledging government’s effort in spite of the nation’s challenges, he said ‘’we recognise the multifaceted challenges facing government and commend its effort at meeting the yearning of the organised private sector. However, there is the urgent need for a deliberate and not accidental policies aimed at channeling cheap credit to businesses, creating a favorable environment for enterprises to thrive and reduction of Regulatory Predatory tendencies. This will enable the private sector to create jobs and wealth for the teeming youths and provide opportunities for Government to generate income.”

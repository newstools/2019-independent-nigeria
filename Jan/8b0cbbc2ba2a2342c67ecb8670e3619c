Super Eagles striker Odion Ighalo has foreclosed the possibility of signing for Tottenham Hotspur in the January transfer window due to the presence of England international Harry Kane and second choice, Fernando Llorente. Ighalo is reportedly a target of some European clubs notably Barcelona but the former Granada and Udinese star whose Chinese Super League side Changchun Yatai were relegated last season spoke to Sky Sports on the possibility of signing a deal for the north London side. “Tottenham are a big team and every player would like to play for them but if you look now, Harry Kane is playing regularly and Fernando Llorente isn’t. “For Kane not to play for Spurs means he’ll be out for many months. “For me, I will like to play for a team that will play me regularly, ” Ighalo stressed with a demeanour that suggests it is not an option. Kane sustained a hamstring injury in Spurs’ 1-0 defeat to Manchester United on Sunday evening. Ighalo scored 48 Championship and Premier League goals in 90 appearances for Watford in his three year stint in England.

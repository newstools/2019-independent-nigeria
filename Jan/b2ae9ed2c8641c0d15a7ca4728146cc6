Erykah Badu has been involved in a Twitter dispute with Surviving R. Kelly producer Dream Hampton over claims she was approached to appear in the documentary. The singer hit headlines over the weekend when she told the audience at her concert in Chicago that she was “putting up a prayer right now” for R. Kelly, who has come under further scrutiny and lost record deals after the broadcast of the damning documentary which featured numerous women accusing him of sexual abuse or misconduct. Following the concert incident, a Twitter user told Erykah she wasn’t surprised she declined to be part of the documentary, but Erykah responded on Tuesday night and insisted she had never been asked to participate. Hampton then weighed in to suggest otherwise, writing, “I asked Producer T. Farris to contact @fatbellybella (Erykah) to be in doc because I wanted clarity on two things: 1) a quote attributed to her, ‘No one has done more for Black people than R. Kelly’ & 2) what she was thinking when she called him her ‘brother’ at Soul Train Awards.” The 47-year-old replied, “No ma’am. I WAS NOT EVER contacted by anyone to be in documentary.@dreamhampton You know that’s not true. I wasn’t a necessary component. You had all the right people, the ones close to the situation…But for now, produce this ‘producer’s’ request or… APOLOGIZE. It’s simple.” Hampton told Erykah that she would not be producing the texts from her producer and continued, “Apologize? Are you kidding? Again, you PUBLICLY said he did more for black people than anyone? If you want to apologize for that, fine, apology accepted… What you meant by calling him your brother from the stage, I’ll never know..” Erykah, who introduced Kelly and said he “has done more for black people than anyone” at the 2015 Soul Train Awards, clarified her onstage remarks on Sunday, saying she loves him “unconditionally” and wants healing for him, but doesn’t support his choices.

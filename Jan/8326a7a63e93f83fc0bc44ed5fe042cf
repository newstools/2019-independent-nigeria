GOMBE – The dream of Northern Nigeria returning to its lost glory of being the bastion of food production has started yielding results with the creation of large pyramids of sorghum, maize, soya beans and cotton in Gombe State following an N8.9 billion Federal Government intervention in agriculture in the state. The unveiling of the pyramids took place at the flag-off of loan payment and handing over ceremony of produce to Community Depot and Exchange Centre (COMDEC) under the Central Bank of Nigeria, Bank of Agriculture, North-East Commodity Association, and Anchor Borrowers Programme of the CBN. According to Alhaji Ahmed Muhammad Dukku, Gombe State chapter chairman of North-East Commodity Association (NECAS), the occasion was a happy one for farmers in the state following the handing over of over 30, 000 bags of sorghum, maize, soya beans and cotton, which formed the pyramid to boost food product for the country. He said the pyramid was for the repayment of loans given to farmers on the platform of the North-East Commodity Association by the Central Bank of Nigeria through the Bank of Agriculture. He explained that over 8,000 farmers in Gombe State, who benefitted from the Anchor Borrowers Programme of the CBN had cultivated and produced the produce being unveiled. He said, “Farmers have appreciated the efforts of the Federal Government and that is why we are willingly bringing back the loan and repayments through this produce you are seeing. This pyramid you are seeing and all the stores behind us here are filled to the brim with produce that has been collected from farmers that have benefitted from the ABP through NECAS.” He explained further that, “People are employed aggregating and preparing all produce for handing over to our off-taker. The produce you are seeing before us here is what we received just this morning. On a daily bases, we receive nothing less than 600 to 700 bags from farmers across the 11 local government areas of Gombe State.”

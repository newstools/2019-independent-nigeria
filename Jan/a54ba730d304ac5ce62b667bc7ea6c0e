This year’s International Para Powerlifting Championships is scheduled to start January 24th in Lagos and run till the 31st of the same month. One of the key lifters that host Nigeria will be relying on for glory is African champion, Ebere Okpala. With just about two weeks to go before the competition begins, Okpala said she is ready for the championship and hopes to use home advantage to excel in the rush for medals. The Anambra State-born lifter revealed further that the Nigerian team’s coaches and officials have been very helpful to her and other lifters in the contingent. She noted that the technical crew has taken the lifters through various training programmes, with a lot of variations and innovations, which she believes will put them in good stead to win medals later this month. “Since the event is happening on my home soil, I promise to do my best to do more and surpass my previous record. “My preparation is going on smoothly and I am giving all it takes to remain at the top. “After winning my category at the National Sports Festival (NSF), I knew all I had to do was to train more and more. “This will be my second international championship since I joined the national team. “I made my debut into the national team by winning gold at the 2018 Africa Para Powerlifting Championships in Algeria. “I want to maintain the standard. I know it is not going to be easy but God is in control.”

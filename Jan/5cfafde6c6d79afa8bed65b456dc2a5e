Little known Koluama Seven Brothers, a militant group, said on Sunday it carried out a warning strike on an oil facility owned by Conoil on Friday at Koluama community in Southern Ijaw area of Bayelsa State. Koluama Seven Brothers is threatening a production shut-down as it demands action from Conoil and King Solomon Eddy on issues such as job creation. “Our early-hour strike of 12:20a.m on 4th January, 2019 at Angle2 field of Conoil is just a warning to Conoil, King Solomon Eddy and his cartel. If Conoil and King Solomon fail to address the issues behind the MoU, scholarships, job creation, for the people of Koluama Clan, then we have no other option than to launch a strike to shut down Conoil,” spokesman of the group, Angel Michael, said in a statement. Residents said a deafening sound was heard on Friday, which resulted in panic in the fishing community of Koluama. The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps said a blast was heard on Friday around a Conoil pipeline in the Koluama community of Bayelsa, but a patrol check had not revealed any leaks. It would be recalled that a coalition of Niger Delta militants, under the aegis of Niger Delta Avengers, last week, threatened to withdraw a ceasefire agreement it reached with the Federal Government and the Pan Niger Delta Elders’ Forum (PANDEF). It said it was considering withdrawal from the agreement following what it said was the refusal of the government to implement the requests it reached with the PANDEF on behalf of the people of the region.

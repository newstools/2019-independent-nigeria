Last year Avengers Infinity War was the highest-grossing movie of 2018 by a country mile. The Marvel epic also became the fourth film in history to make over $2 billion worldwide on a budget of around $400 million. And while Black Panther has seven Oscar nominations, Avengers Infinity War also received one too. The film has been nominated for Best Visual Effects at the 91st Academy Awards and franchise star Downey Jr has been celebrating. Posting on Twitter the nomination poster with Thanos looking pretty mad on Titan, Downey Jr praised the film and admitted how proud he was to be on the superhero team. The 53-year-old wrote: “Proud to be an Avenger. Congrats all!” While Marvel fans will be pleased for Black Panther’s recognition, including Best Picture, it’s a shame that Avengers Infinity War didn’t get more recognition. After all, the Marvel epic was a Hollywood first as a climatic crossover of 20-odd movies made over the last decade.

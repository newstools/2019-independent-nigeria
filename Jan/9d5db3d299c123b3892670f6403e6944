Lagos – Despite his side’s 2-1 away victory over Bantu FC of Lesotho in the first leg of the CAF Confederation Cup Playoff on Sunday, Gbenga Ogunbote, chief coach of Rangers International of Enugu, has warned his players ahead of the return leg in Enugu. Ogunbote stated that, despite losing at home, Bantu FC showed that they are a good team, which deserved to be in the Confederation Cup play-off. “With what we saw of the team in the first leg, we must prepare very well for the return leg in Enugu, which means we must not relax if we must scale through”, he said. He however showered praises on his players for getting the result in the first leg. “Am very happy that my players held their own against a side that played well and were determined to get something out of the game”, he said. Rangers got goals from Bright Silas and Godwin Aguda on Sunday, to snatch a stimulating 2-1 win away. The away win takes Rangers a step closer to the second-tier continental competition’s group stage, as they now only need a draw from the reverse fixture in Enugu to qualify. The return leg will be played in Enugu on January 20 with the overall winners advancing to the league stage of the competition, which now appears within reach for the Nigerian Cup winners. The Coal City side looked on the way when Silas opened scoring early in the game to register his fourth goal of the competition, before Aguda hit home a second after the restart. Bantu, who dropped out of the second round of the CAF Champions League, got a consolation goal, but Rangers held on for a famous win, much to Ogunbote’s relief.

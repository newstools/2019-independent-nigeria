Lagos – As the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations is five months away, Henry Onyekuru, the Nigerian international expected to play a role in the national team’s match in Egypt, has fired a warning with a hat-trick for his Turkish side, Galatasaray, in their 6-0 wrecking of Ankaragucu. Galatasaray player, Sinan Gumus, opened the goals tunnel in the first minute before Onyekuru doubled the lead in the 21st minute. Galatasaray resumed the second stanza with more fireworks and it yielded results as Onyekuru made 4-0 in the 59th minutes and the Nigerian completed his hat trick four minutes later. Galatasaray are now third on the table with 35 points from 19 matches so far. This will be a piece of god information for Coach Gernot Rohr, who has severally said that he hoped to beef up the team with in-form players in departments needing attention. It will equally interest the coach who has had to rely so much on Odion Ighalo to deliver with the former China-base forward living up to expectation, particularly during the 2019 AFCON qualifiers.

Suzan Edeh Bauchi – Ibrahim Abdullahi, the Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Bauchi State, has regretted that women, particularly in Africa, are relegated to the background despite their contributions to the socio-economic development of nations. Abdullahi noted this in his opening address at a one-day seminar on mitigating violence against women in elections held on Monday in Bauchi. The REC disclosed that instances abound in the political sphere where women are physically assaulted and psychologically violated, citing as examples late Benazzir Bhutto and Hajiya Gambo Sawaba, adding that the harassment of Senator Remi Tinubu at the National Assembly is another typical example of physical violence against women. He commended the courage of Nigerian women for moving ahead to enforce their rights to fair political participation in spite of all odds, pointing out that since democracy is about participatory and good governance, no segment of the democratic society should be excluded. Abdullahi said that electoral violence against women was damaging to democratic societies especially in a country like Nigeria that has attempted inclusive governance, saying, “it should, therefore, be addressed and ultimately prevented as failure to do so is likely to result to minimal participation of women in the electoral process and voter apathy in the process as a whole.” While stating that the commission values women participation in the electoral process and through the gender unit has created a platform for women as its own contribution to fighting gender-based violence, the REC stated that the reason for the seminar was to enlighten participants and rub minds on how gender-based violence was likely to cause physical, sexual or mental harm in the electoral process and how to totally eradicate, curtail or make it less severe. He emphasised that violence against women is a grave violation of human rights as its impact ranges from immediate to long term repercutions with multiple physical, sexual and mental consequences adding that all hands must be on deck to fight this monster especially during the elections.

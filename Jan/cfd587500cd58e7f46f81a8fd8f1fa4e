Santiago Solari has had to call up a number of players from the club’s Castilla ranks to make up the numbers in training amid in injury crisis. Real Madrid were without a host of senior players as they prepared for Wednesday night’s Copa del Rey meeting with Leganes. Santiago Solari’s side lead 3-0 from the first leg, but the Argentine won’t be taking risks with a number of struggling stars ahead of Saturday’s La Liga meeting with Sevilla. At Valdebedas on Tuesday morning, Los Blancos were without Mariano, Jesus Vallejo, Marcos Llorente, Toni Kroos, Marco Asensio, Thibaut Courtois, Karim Benezema and Gareth Bale. All are currently undergoing their own respective rehabilitation programmes. They were also without third choice goalkeeper Kiko Casilla, ahead of his transfer to Leeds United.

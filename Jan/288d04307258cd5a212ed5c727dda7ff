ABUJA – Abayomi Sheba, Acting Chairman of Federal Character Commission (FCC), has revealed reasons President Muhammadu Buhari should be re-elected for a second term in office come February 16 presidential election. Sheba, who spoke to newsmen in Akure, the Ondo State capital, recently, noted that the re-election of Buhari would allow for consolidation on his achievements. He said the gains achieved in the area of security, revamping the economy and most importantly, anti-corruption crusade, would be sustained if the President is re-elected as Nigerians would be the better for it in the next four years. Sheba, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ondo State, said, “President Buhari means well for the country. A second term for him in office will place the country on the path of sustainable growth and inclusive development for the betterment of every Nigeria. “The N-Power scheme of the Buhari-led administration is the first of its kind in the country, so with the Tradermoni and Marketmoni, meant to boost small and medium term enterprises in the country. “The Federal Government is investing massively in infrastructural development. Without modern and efficient infrastructure, there is no way the much needed economic diversification in the country can happen.” “No administration in the history of this country in recent times has invested so much in critical infrastructure like the Buhari-led government. The facts speak for themselves,” he said.

Legendary American rapper, DMX  is expected to be released from prison today. The veteran rapper born Earl Simmons went to jail in January 2018 on a bail violation after previously pleading guilty to tax evasion in November 2017. In March 2018, DMX was sentenced to one year in prison for felony tax evasion.  DMX was scheduled to be released on 27 January, but in a report by Vulture, inmates are allowed to be released on Friday if their release date falls on a weekend. His lawyer Murray Richman told the news site yesterday: “He’s coming home tomorrow. I spoke to him; he’s very happy. “He’s looking forward to being home. He’s never been hotter than now – people have been seeking him out all over.  Mr Richman added that DMX was ‘terrific’ in jail and didn’t become a target because of his celebrity status.

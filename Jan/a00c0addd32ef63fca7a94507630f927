Environment Minister Ricardo Salles stated Tuesday that the Brazilian Government has reached a consensus to keep the country in the Paris Agreement, as part of the UN Framework Convention. Brazil remains committed to the agenda. However, as Salles told the press in Sao Paulo, ‘there are important points in the agreement to be assessed, such as those which could provide financial resources for the country’. He referred to sensitive points concerning the transformation of principles, values or ideas into national legislation. He mentioned the ‘restriction on land management and public policies’. We will look very carefully, because Brazil has autonomy, like any other country, and must take care of the territory according to its interests and priorities’, the Minister argued. During his electoral campaign and after taking office on Jan 1, President Jair Bolsonaro repeatedly criticized the Pact and pointed out that Brazil could abandon it. If it doesn’t change, we’ll come out. Why do we have to stay in it? It’s a potentially damaging agreement for our sovereignty’, Bolsonaro said before asserting that ‘many countries are outside’ the main agreement to curb global warming. Amid controversial statements about indigenous peoples in Brazil who have succeeded, after years of struggle, in demarcating their ancestral lands and creating protected reserves for economic exploration, the ex-military commented these groups could be slowing Brazil’s economic growth. Then-President Michel Temer previously promulgated Brazil’s commitment to the Paris Accord on June 5, 2017, and reiterated his support for the country’s climate change mitigation goals. Brazil will give its contribution and live up to its responsibility, reiterated on the occasion the former ruler of one of the countries which is among the largest pollutant gas emitters in the world and also holds one of the largest forest lungs.

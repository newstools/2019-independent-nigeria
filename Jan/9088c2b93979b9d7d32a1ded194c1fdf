The Bayelsa First  Initiative  (BFI),  has commended the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, President Muhammadu Buhari on the appointment of Professor Nelson Brambaifa as the Acting Managing Director of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). The secretary of the group, Mr Mekunisi Aworabi in a statement in Port Harcourt, described the appointment as a right step in the right direction, based on Prof. Brambaifa’s experience and background as an academic and former Representative of Bayelsa State in the immediate past Board. Mr Aworabi who is also an activist and a social crusader used the opportunity to appreciate the President for sustaining the rotational principle in the appointment of the Chief Executives by selecting a Bayelsan for the position of Managing Director of the Commission in line with the Act establishing it. While expressing delight at the development, the  activist said  he has confidence in the ability of Professor Brambaifa to take the NDDC to the next level as he will bring his wealth of experience in academia and management to bear in the leadership of the commission. Mr Aworabi condemned in strong terms the reported moves by some aggrieved Bayelsans to petition President Buhari on the appointment, adding that such acts will only lead to Ijaw disunity and self-destruction. He, however, used the opportunity to call on all well meaning Bayelsans and people of the Niger Delta area to rally round the new Managing Director to give him support and ideas required to enable him to succeed in his new assignment.

Premier League leaders Liverpool came from behind to win a thriller against Crystal Palace and maintain their title push, while Manchester United edged to victory over Brighton and Newcastle saw off Cardiff in a relegation battle. Two goals from Mohamed Salah helped Liverpool overturn Palace’s first-half advantage and though the Reds were hanging on to their 4-3 lead in injury time, they moved seven points clear at the top. Marcus Rashford showed trickery and poise in his 150th game for United to strike in a narrow win at Old Trafford, while Fabian Schar’s double downed the Bluebirds to move the Magpies out of the bottom three. Bournemouth’s Callum Wilson underlined why he is a target in the January transfer window by smashing the opening goal in their win over West Ham – his 10th league goal of the campaign. In the game’s early kick-off, Wolves’ Diogo Jota became the second Portuguese player after former Manchester United forward Cristiano Ronaldo to net a Premier League hat-trick as his stoppage-time winner beat Leicester in a 4-3 thriller. Southampton midfielder James Ward-Prowse seems to be thriving under new manager Ralph Hasenhuttl as he scored his second goal in as many league games in their win over Everton. And Watford shared a competitive home draw with Burnley, who are now unbeaten in five games.

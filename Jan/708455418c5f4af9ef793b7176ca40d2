Owerri – Rochas Okorocha, Imo State governor has described the Ohaneze Ndigbo as a socio-cultural organization and not a registered political party, saying there is no voting unit or polling booth called Ohaneze. The Governor, in his reaction to the recent adoption of the Presidential Candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar by the Igbo social cultural organisation, dismissed the adoption as a folklore which should not give anybody concern saying “The adoption is neither here nor there, since it has no electoral value.” Sam Onwuemeodo, Chief Press Secretary to the governor in a statement made available to newsmen in Owerri noted that this is also not the first time Ohaneze had adopted a PDP presidential candidate, recalling that it did that in 2015, yet, PDP failed with its presidential candidate, while APC won with its presidential candidate. The Governor advised the Ohaneze to exercise caution this time following what happened in 2015, stressing that the organisation should have done things differently, especially when it remembers that all Igbo whether in PDP, APC, APGA, ADC or SDP are presumed to be members of Ohaneze. Not minding the adoption, he boasted that President Muhammadu Buhari would win in the Southeast and the general election. He advised the Igbo in the APC to remain focused and not to make the adoption an issue.

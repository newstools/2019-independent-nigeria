The second round of the round of 16 matches in the ongoing Delta State/Zenith Bank Principals’ Cup will hold in 10 centres today across the state. The round of 16 first round matches was played on Monday with Obule Integrated School beating Ogbeh Ijoh Grammar school 3-0 in a match that saw Gift Edirin record a brace with one goal in each half (42nd and 60th minutes). It was Omom Simon, who opened scoring in the 25th minute for the representative of Sapele Local Government who will now need one win in their match today to book a quarterfinal place. In another match, Aniocha North defeated Ika North East representatives 2-1 to also keep their last eight ticket alive. Ukwani defeated Isoko South 1-0, Isoko North beat Patani also 1-0, while Warri South recorded the same slim victory over Uwvie. Udokwa West and Bomadi played out a goalless draw just as Ughelli North and Burutu ended their encounter 1-1. The second round of matches today will be decisive for all teams as two wins will be enough to move on while those yet to win must win well to remain in the contention. “The competition is getting more interesting now and the standard is very high even beyond our expectations. The players are very happy. We thank governor Okowa and the sponsors Zenith Bank for keeping faith with this event in the past three years. It can only get better,” head of the organizing team, Tony Pemu said on Tuesday.

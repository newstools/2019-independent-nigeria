LAGOS – Mfon Udoh, the Akwa United forward, is confident Super Eagles will win the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations holding in Egypt in the summer. Udoh, in an interview with DAILY INDEPENDENT, premised his belief on the players’ current form, saying that their form would make any one optimistic of their success in Egypt. “Nigeria have a lot of quality players right now, so I don’t see them failing to win the Nations Cup. I am not talking of pedigree but the players’ current form. “I don’t want to sound over confident here but I have my money on the Super Eagles to do very well in the AFCON or even win it because the players are young, athletic and ambitious,” he said. When reminded that countries like Egypt and Senegal would be featuring in the competition, the former Enyimba of Aba star and one-time CAF Champions League top scorer said that much as he was not underrating the duo, it was important to know that Nigeria stands a huge chance against them. “It does not matter. I am not underrating them but we stand a tall chance against these countries and may even go ahead to win the cup. My emphasis here is because of the current form of the players, which, I think, will interest any coach,” he said.

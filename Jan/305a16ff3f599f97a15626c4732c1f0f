The 7th edition of the largest international meeting of Africa’s private sector will be held on March 25 and 26 in Kigali, Rwanda. Leading decision-makers from industry, finance and politics, will come from more than 70 countries to discuss regional integration along with other key topics for the development of Africa’s businesses during the international meeting. Africa’s most influential business leaders have decided to come together and make their voices heard in Kigali, Rwanda not only at a time when intra-continental trade remains too weak, but to bring to the fore the burning issues to address in order to make African economic integration a reality. Their goal: to make the implementation of the Continental Free Trade Area (CFTA) a powerful driver for private sector growth and the emergence of new African champions. The Africa CEO Forum 2019 will unite its 1,500 participants around a real agenda for transformation: How can we mobilise the private sector around cross-border infrastructure and logistical projects? What insights can be drawn from the East African Community – considered the most successful regional model – given the tense new political waters? What must a united Africa do to better protect its interests and industries? Through some forty panel discussions, case studies, testimonies, public-private workshops and thematic working groups, the business leaders will come to grips with these key topics while continuing to explore the other major challenges for the development of Africa’s private sector, such as women leaders’ access to the boardroom, the growth potential of Africa’s tourism industry, banking penetration in the digital age, regional agribusiness markets, and the governance of family firms.

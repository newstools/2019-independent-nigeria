Thousands of people have signed a petition against the removal of an Iranian couple whose family all live in the UK. Mozaffar Saberi, 83, and Rezvan Habibimarand, 73, bought a flat in Edinburgh in the late 1970s and have four children, 11 grandchildren and a great-grandchild who are all British citizens. The couple spent time in the UK on visitor visas over the years but after visiting in November 2012 they made an application to remain on human rights grounds which was refused by the Home Office. A second application was also refused and they are now appealing against the decision, with the case due to be heard on February 25. The couple are distressed at the prospect of being separated from their family who all live in Edinburgh. Their son Navid Saberi said: “It is very very stressful. They are elderly and not really keeping well and on top of their health problems it is a psychological effect, not knowing what is around the corner and what is going to happen in the future. “The prospect of leaving three generations of children, grandchildren and a great-grandchild and going back to Iran has not been easy for them.” He added: “They have got nobody in Iran. It is just beyond belief.”

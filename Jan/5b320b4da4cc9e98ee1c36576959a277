At least 30 people were injured in clashes between protesting garment workers and police in the Bangladeshi capital on Thursday, local media reported, according to Aa.com.tr reports. Several hundreds of garment workers took to the streets for the fifth consecutive day against alleged disparity in the new wage structure, demanding implementation of minimum wage. The clash took place when police personnel fired tear shells in a bid to disperse the protesters, leaving 30 people injured, Dhaka Tribune, a local daily, said in a report. Protests also continued in Savar, Ashulia and Gazipur, on the outskirts of the capital. Meantime, a committee consisting of representatives from the government, garment owners and workers held its first meeting chaired by Secretary of the Employment Ministry Afroza Khan in Dhaka. Earlier, garment owners met the State Minister for Labor and Employment Monnuzan Sufian to find out solution. But, both meetings failed to reach any consensus to resolve the ongoing crisis. Workers said they took to the streets after they found alleged disparity in the raise of wages among the different grades in the latest wage gazette for the garment workers. Earlier, government formed a wage board for 4.4 million ready-made garment workers in January last year which came into effect from December 1. In the latest wage board, the minimum wage for the garment workers was revised to $95 from $63. Bangladesh is the second largest exporter of ready-made garment goods that insiders fear of losing if such unrest continues.

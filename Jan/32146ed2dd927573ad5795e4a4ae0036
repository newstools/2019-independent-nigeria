Lagos – Nwankwo Kanu, former Super Eagles captain, is not afraid of the team’s chances of  winning the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations, acknowledging that it might be tough to win but not impossible. The former Arsenal forward said that it was his prayer that the Super Eagles win Nigeria’s fourth Africa Cup of Nations title in Egypt later in the year, urging the authorities to always honour their sportsmen and women, even as he urged the Super Falcons to surpass their previous World Cup achievements. The 1996 and 1999 African Footballer of the Year winner also charged Nigerian players to redouble their efforts this year so that they would not be overlooked in the African Team of the Year after being shunned by the team picked by FIFpro. “We keep praying that 2019 will be better than 2018. But we have to celebrate our heroes while they’re alive. That reminds us of the late Stephen Keshi, Amodu Shuaibu, Samuel Okwaraji, that’s why the women’s teams seem to complain. Let the ‘female’ teams do better than they have done before in previous World Cups,” Kanu told Brila FM. “As for the Super Eagles, I hope they win the Nations Cup, that’s what I tell people. The players are making me happy – Mikel Obi, Alex Iwobi and others are playing well, that’s why I’m not panicking. I can’t start pinpointing any players’ names. I believe they’re going to win the 2019 Nations Cup. “The future is bright (for the Super Eagles). We have players playing week in and out there in Europe,” Papilo stressed.

Lagos – After he initially objected to leaving England, embattled Chelsea winger, Victor Moses, is set to formalize his loan deal from the Blues to Fernebahce of Turkey in a deal worth £2.86 million. Feelers from his club indicated that Moses was lured by the Turkish Super Lig club’s agreement to pay him the huge amount for the remainder of the season. It was gathered that the figure amounts to full wages he will earn for the remaining part of this season, but Fernebahce did not bat an eyelid in agreeing to dole out the cash for him. The Istanbul-based club were, therefore, able to convince Moses not only to step out of England for the first time in his professional club football career, but snub some equally tempting offers in Queensland. The Yellow Canaries reached an agreement with Chelsea last week for Moses to join them on loan for the remaining half of the season and, though the player was initially reluctant, he eventually turned up in Istanbul on Wednesday, after agreeing personal terms with the officials Moses landed in Istanbul on Wednesday evening, accompanied by his wife, to seal a five-month loan deal that will see the 28-year-old play on loan outside Stamford Bridge for the fourth time in his contract. Previous stints for him, though, had been in England – with Liverpool, West Ham United and Stoke City – such that all pointers had been at the possibility of him taking up offers from Fulham, Huddersfield Town and his former club, Crystal Palace. However, while all the English Premier League clubs failed to reach any agreement with Moses, due to his high wages, Fenerbahce won him over by agreeing to put up his wages in full for the remainder of the season.

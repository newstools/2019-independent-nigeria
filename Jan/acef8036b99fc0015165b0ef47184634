Greece’s parliament has scheduled a confidence vote for late Wednesday following the collapse of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras’ governing coalition over a proposed deal to end a decades-old dispute with Macedonia. The nationalist Independent Greeks party ended its four-year partnership with Tsipras’ left-wing Syriza party on Sunday. The government now needs the backing of six lawmakers from opposition parties or independents to avoid a snap election. Three had openly declared their support for the government as of Monday. The pre-vote debate is set to start with remarks by Tsipras, who has vowed to complete his term and call an October election. Greek lawmakers haven’t yet voted on whether to ratify the deal with Macedonia. It requires the country to be renamed North Macedonia and Greece to stop blocking its NATO membership.

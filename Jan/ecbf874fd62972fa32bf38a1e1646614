ADO-EKITI – Erelu Bisi Fayemi, wife of Ekiti State governor, has cautioned supporters of the All Progressives Congress (APC) against voting wrongly in the 2019 general elections. Speaking at the flag-off of campaigns into Irepodun \Ifelodun State Constituency 2 election in Igbemo Ekiti, the governor’s wife urged the people of the area to vote en masse for APC candidate, Hakeem Jamiu. Jamiu, who hails from the town, was the Senior Special Assistant on Research and Documentation during the first term of Governor Kayode Fayemi. Mrs. Fayemi also urged APC members not to listen or follow the dictate of some aggrieved members of the party who promised to vote for President Muhammadu Buhari while they fielded candidates in other political parties, describing the trend as dangerous for the success of APC. “I don’t want you to embrace skirt and blouse voting being canvassed by some leaders of APC. Let it be a full caftan.” The first lady said Buhari remained the best option for Nigeria, urging Ekiti voters to vote massively for the candidates fielded by the APC for the presidential, National and State Assembly elections in the state. “Nigeria can’t return to looters again; we can’t go back to a period when our commonwealth was being wasted by few individuals, that is why we have to allow President Buhari to continue. “The APC didn’t just pick Mr. Jamiu because of his closeness to my husband, but because of his competence. He had served in government before and he did well. There is nowhere you put him that he won’t perform, so he is going to be a perfect match as a lawmaker and Fayemi as a governor. Addressing the crowd, Jamiu said the entire Igbemo Community was cut off from the rest of Ekiti under Fayose due to alleged inability of the state government to construct a collapsed bridge that links the town to ex-governor’s country home.

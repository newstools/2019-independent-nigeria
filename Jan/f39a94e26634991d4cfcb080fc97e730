AWKA – Mr. Oseloka Henry Obaze, the Chairman, Anambra State chapter of the Atiku-Obi Presidential Campaign Council, has said mass poverty and insecurity in the country spells of poor knowledge of the economy and the inner workings of government. Obaze made the remarks in an interactive session at Obosi, Anambra State, at the weekend that the level of poverty and hunger in Nigeria today, occasioned by the incumbent administration’s poor management of and failure to diversify the economy, has made it imperative for the masses to elect leaders who know how to manage and grow the economy. Obaze, who was governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2017 Anambra governorship election, derided the current economic thinking that has led to recession, high cost of living, job losses, downsizing and shutting down of businesses. He said the management of the economy under the present administration has been nothing but dismal. Obaze said that for that reason, the interests of the poor masses, millions of unemployed Nigerians, market men and women, artisans and the business community are better served with PDP’s Atiku-Obi, who is poised to provide economic security, improve quality of life and reduce poverty. He said Atiku Abubakar, in addition to his executive leadership experience, is an employer of labour, while his running mate, Peter Obi, an ex-governor, is an accomplished banker and a trader of repute, adding that the duo possessed what it takes to grow the economy. Obaze also lauded Atiku’s plan to privatise the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). He said there is no point misunderstanding Atiku on the issue because privatisation of the NNPC, deregulation and creating smaller modular refineries across the nation, will bring more efficiency to the corporation and reposition it to deliver more services to Nigerians.

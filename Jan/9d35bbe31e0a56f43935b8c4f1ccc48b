Leeds United are set to field further interest for winger, Jack Clarke, with Spurs emerging as the latest club to prepare a formal bid for him, according to Football Insider. The 18-year-old has stole the headlines in recent weeks for a number of impressive performances for promotion chasing Leeds this season in the Championship. Clarke is one of the most sought after young English talents this year, and it’s no surprise to see the top Premier League sides eyeing a deal to sign him. He has two goals to his name, and also was on hand to provide an assist for Kemar Roofe in Leeds’ win over Derby on Friday with the Whites extending their lead at the top of the table. Leeds are said to be delaying contract talks with Clarke until the end of the season, which has alerted a number of Premier League sides, including Spurs who are interested in signing him. Not many would have been aware of Clarke at the start of the season, but his emergence to the first-team is understandable, given the recent injury crisis that Marcelo Bielsa has had to deal with. Manchester City were also said to be interested in a deal to bring Clarke in according to The Sun in December, but they are yet to make an official bid for the youngster. A move to Tottenham could tempt Clarke, as Spurs boss, Mauricio Pochettino has already given a number of young players a chance in the first team this season which will be pleasing to see for the Leeds man. The Verdict: This could be a devastating blow for Leeds’ promotion bid. Clarke has shown his exciting potential in recent weeks, and is a crucial member of Marcelo Bielsa’s squad this year as they challenge for a return to the top flight. If Leeds have any ambition, then they will surely do everything they can to keep hold of Clarke for the remainder of the season.

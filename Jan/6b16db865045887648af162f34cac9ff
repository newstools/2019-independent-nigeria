LAGOS – Finland has ranked first in the Good Country Index published on Wednesday. According to a statement by the Embassy of Finland in Abuja, on Wednesday, the results of the Index indicate that, relative to its size, Finland contributes more to humanity and burdens the planet less than any other country. In the fourth edition of the Good Country Index, which measures 153 countries’ performance and ranks them on the basis of their overall impact on the planet, Finland rose from fourth place to the top. The other leading countries are Ireland, Sweden, Germany and Denmark. Timo Soini, Finnish Minister for Foreign Affairs, was due to receive the recognition on Wednesday during the World Economic Forum in Davos, the statement said. “This is an excellent recognition. Finland is a good, down-to-earth country and we are a reliable partner in international fora. Our performance is the result of consistent work and I witness it in my work on an almost daily basis. The recognition is good for Finland’s internal discussion and atmosphere. Let’s be proud of ourselves for a moment and let’s continue to pursue even better results,” Soini stated. According to the statement, Soini’s address in Davos will be videoed and published on the ministry’s website at um.fi. “The Good Country Index looks at 35 criteria, based on data produced by the United Nations and other international organisations.”

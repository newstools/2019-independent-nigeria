Tottenham striker Harry Kane has been unsurprisingly voted England Player of the Year for 2018, according to Standard.co.uk reports. Kane captained England to the World Cup semi-final, winning the tournament’s golden boot with six goals, to earn the fan-voted accolade for the second year in a row. He also became just the third Englishman to net a hat-trick at a World Cup in the process, and continued his good form by scoring a last-minute winner against Croatia to send England to the inaugural Uefa Nations League finals next summer. “To be voted England’s best player for the second successive year is something I’m immensely proud of,” Kane told the FA website. “After such a monumental year, this award has particular significance as it’s always an honour to be recognised by the people that count the most – the fans. “However, it took a collective effort from my England team-mates, Gareth Southgate and his staff to achieve such a positive 2018 and we were backed by fantastic support both from the stands and back at home along the way. “We don’t want 2018 to be our only high point so here’s to continued progression with Euro 2020 qualifying and the UEFA Nations League finals in 2019.” Everton striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin was named U21 Player of the Year, after scoring five goals as England qualified comfortably for this summer’s European Championships.

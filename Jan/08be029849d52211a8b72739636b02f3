In a renewed vigour to ensure that only goods and services fit for human consumption are allowed to thrive at the nation’s market, the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) has restated its commitment to safeguard the lives of unsuspecting consumers from unwholesome goods that are injurious to health. Indeed, the agency stressed the need for consumers to always insist on patronising only authorised dealers and distributors of goods and services, noting that this was one the surest ways to reduce the level of substandard goods in the country. The Director General, SON, Osita Aboloma, said his agency would stop at nothing to protect the nation from goods that fail to meet all the quality parameters especially substandard gas cylinders which he said remained a time bomb capable of destroying lives and property. The SON boss who was represented by the Director, Compliance, SON, Engr. Obiora Manafa at a destruction exercise in Lagos said: “Substandard gas cylinders, tyres, cables, motorcycle tubes, extension sockets and unfortified sugar will be destroyed by the agency. We urge all Nigerians to be vigilant in purchasing house hold products. We have always advised that consumers must always insist on patronising authorised dealers and distributors. We cannot allow these products into the markets, they failed all the quality parameters and that is why we have brought them here to destroy so that they do not find their way into the hands of the unsuspecting consumers.’’ He also appealed to importers of fake and substandard goods to desist from wasting financial resources on importation of goods with no economic value.

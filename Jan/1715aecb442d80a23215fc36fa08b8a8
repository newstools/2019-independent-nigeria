LAGOS – Dr Victor David Enweruzo, the Lagos State Coordinator of Unit2Unit Initiative, a pressure group, has said that the organisation will deliver Lagos State for former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and his running mate, former Anambra State governor, Peter Obi. Enweruzo, who spoke to newsmen on the sideline of the group’s stakeholders’ meeting on Friday in Lagos, maintained that Unit2Unit Initiative has the structure and foot soldiers at all levels to deliver on its promises to Atiku during the 2019 presidential election. He said the group commands over two million membership spread across all the local governments (LGs) and Local Council Development Authorities (LCDAs) and wards in the state, even as he stressed that his structure was made up of vibrant men, women and youths, who he said, would deliver at the appropriate time. He, however, accused the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state of using official machinery to intimidate people, especially traders, teachers, nurses and artisans, saying the group had heard of allegations of people being made to part with their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) after payment of certain amounts ranging from N10,000 and above, while some were being made to thumbprint on laptops, thereby giving out their data for the purpose of rigging the elections. While calling on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and security agencies to investigate the allegations, he lamented that people were being intimidated because they did not know their rights, neither did they know the provisions of the constitution and the law.”

The Federal Government on Thursday re-arraigned a businessman, Mr Vincent Osiahon, at the Federal High Court, Abuja, for allegedly receiving over N9 million from one Sunny Atuma with intent to defraud him. Osiahon, who allegedly committed the offence in Karu, Abuja, is facing a 27-count charge of obtaining money by false pretense with intent to defraud. Following Osiahon’s not-guilty plea after the charge was read to him, the prosecutor, Mr Y.Y. Tarfa asked the court for a date to commence trial. Osiahon’s counsel, Mr ANC Ikyo, however, told the court that the defendant was already on bail. He added that he had never breached the conditions of his bail since 2012 when the matter began. He prayed the court to allow his client to continue to enjoy the bail already granted him by the court. The trial judge, Justice F.O. Giwa Ogunbanjo said that the defendant could continue to enjoy his bail and adjourned the matter until Feb. 13 for commencement of trial. Justice Ogunbanjo also gave nine additional days for the trial to be conducted within, saying that she expected the trial to be concluded within the given days. One of the counts read that: ‘‘You, Victor Osiahon, on May 28, 2008 in Karu and within the jurisdiction of this court, with intent to defraud, obtained the sum of N2.7 million from Sunny Atuma to invest in oil allocation contract which you knew to be false. “By this act, you committed an offence contrary to Section 1 (a) of the Advanced Fee Fraud Act and punishable under the same act.”

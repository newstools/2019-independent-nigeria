Japanese Naomi Osaka reward for winning her maiden Australian Open on Saturday was £2.35m. This was not her only reward; her other reward was that she became the first Asian, male or female, to become world number one. By winning the Australian Open, Osaka proved that beating Serena Williams in the final of the US Open last year was no fluke. She is the first woman to win back-to-back Majors, other than Serena Williams, since Kim Clijsters at the beginning of this decade. To achieve this feat, the Japanese defeated Czech Petra Kvitova 7-6 (7-2) 5-7 6-4. After receiving the winner’s cheque for £2.35million Osaka, a little overwhelmed, told her opponent: ‘You have been through so much and huge congrats to you.’ Osaka was all smiles during the trophy presentation in Melbourne – in contrast to her US Open victory – and she continued a tradition of slightly awkward acceptance speeches. “Erm, hello. Sorry, public speaking isn’t my strong point so I hope I can get through this,” she said. “I read notes before this but I still forgot what I was meant to say. Thank you everyone, I am really honoured to have played in this final.”

Abuja – Barely 25 days to the 2019 presidential election, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has warned the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to resist pressure from the All Progressives Congress (APC) and President Muhammadu Buhari. Addressing newsmen on Monday, in Abuja, the spokesman of the PDP and the Director of Media and Publicity of PPCO, Kola Ologbondiyan, alleged that the INEC Chairman, Mahmood Yakubu, was being compromised by the APC and the Buhari Presidency with offers of huge sums of money, choice property within and outside Nigeria, as well as juicy appointments to his relations as bribes, in return for the rigging of the elections in favour of President Muhammadu Buhari and the APC. He said that presently, more than half of the card readers to be used in the elections had been rendered obsolete and non-functional, adding that less than 30 days to the elections, the card readers had not been upgraded. The party spokesman challenged the INEC boss to rise above the manifest compromises and conduct the 2019 general elections in a transparent manner, adding that the entire nation was worried. The party said the palpable fear of every Nigerian today was whether Mahmood Yakubu could conduct an election which would indeed be free, fair, credible, and transparent. “This is particularly as allegations are rife in the public space that the INEC Chairman is being compromised by the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Buhari Presidency with offers of huge sums of money, choice property within and outside Nigeria, as well as juicy appointments to his relations as bribes, in return for the rigging of the elections in favour of President Muhammadu Buhari and the APC.”

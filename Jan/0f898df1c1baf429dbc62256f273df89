Spain’s Roberto Bautista Agut held off a thrilling fight back from the ailing Andy Murray on Monday to claim a 6-4 6-4 6-7(5) 6-7(4) 6-2 epic victory at the Australian Open. Murray’s hopes of a fairytale end at the opening Grand Slam of the year were crushed in the first round as he lost the battle with his troublesome right hip. In the game, the former world number one whipped the Melbourne Arena crowd into frenzy as he battled back from two sets down to push the match into a fifth. It seemed then that the momentum was all Murray’s, but it was all a mirage as Bautista Agut rallied to break the Scot twice and roar to a 5-1 lead in the decider. Murray raised his racquet to salute the crowd before his final service game. But his fans could not prevent Bautista Agut serving out the match to love and ending the Scot’s brave resistance after four hours and nine minutes. On Friday, a teary-eyed Murray had said the Australian Open could be his last tournament as a professional but the battle-scarred 31-year-old had also left the door ajar for a return. “Maybe I’ll see you again, I’ll do everything possible to try,” the three-time Grand Slam champion said in his on-court interview. “I’ve honestly loved playing here over the years… if this was my last match, like you say, (it’s) an amazing way to end, I gave literally everything I had.” Bautista Agut was also majestic under pressure as he beat Murray and a crowd that often barely murmured when he hit winners. “Andy deserved this atmosphere,” he said. “It was an unbelievable match… I want to congratulate him on all he did for tennis.” Meanwhile, defending champion Roger Federer served straight through Denis Istomin to win their first round encounter, securing a 6-3 6-4 6-4 victory on Monday evening. Federer will now play British qualifier Dan Evans, ranked 189 in the world, in the second round.

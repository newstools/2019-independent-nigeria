Detectives have charged a teenager with the murder of 14-year-old Jaden Moodie. Ayoub Majdouline, 18, was charged with murder after he was arrested on Saturday morning. Majdouline, of no fixed address but from Wembley, north-west London, where he was arrested, will appear at Thames Magistrates’ Court on Monday, Scotland Yard said. A spokesman added: “Detectives from the Homicide and Major Crime Command are continuing to investigate Jaden’s murder and would appeal for anyone with information, who has yet to come forward, to call police.” Jaden was stabbed to death on January 8 in Leyton, east London, after a group of five men in a black Mercedes rammed him off a moped, police believe.

Three of the men are thought to have got out of the vehicle before Jaden was knifed, then all five suspects fled in the car. In an appeal for witnesses on Saturday, Detective Chief Inspector Chris Soole, who leads the inquiry, said: “We have a number of inquiries that we are pursuing, however, we cannot solve this alone, we need the public to help us. “Due to the location and time of the attack we know there are a number of people out there who either witnessed the incident or who have information about this heinous crime and we would like to hear from them. “I firmly believe that someone out there knows the people who are responsible for Jaden’s murder.”

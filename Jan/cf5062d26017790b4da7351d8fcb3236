Lagos – Acting Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Abubakar Adamu, is set to retire the seven Deputy Inspectors-General of Police, according to police sources. The affected officers are Maigari Dikko, the DIG in charge of finance and administration and Habila Joshak, the DIG in charge of operations. Others are Emmanuel Inyang, DIG in charge of information and communications technology; Agboola Oshodi-Glover, logistics and supply; Mohammed Katsina, research and planning; Sani Mohammed, training and development; and Peace Ibekwe-Abdallah, federal criminal investigation and intelligence. Meanwhile, consequent upon intelligence report indicating the presence of huge quantity of arms unlawfully possessed by some Nigerians, as well as the desperation of some citizens to acquire more arms, Adamu has called on all Nigerians currently in unlawful possession of such weapons to immediately and voluntarily return them to police station or public armoury nearest to them. Also with immediate effect, the IGP placed an embargo on the issuance of new licences for designated arms throughout the country. In a statement by Frank Mba, an Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) and Force Public Relations Officer, Adamu advises Nigerians to take advantage of the “voluntary arms return window” and do the right thing as there would be dire consequences for defaulters and those who fail to heed the call. The Force has also perfected plans to embark on a massive, nationwide joint arms mopping up operations. The operation, which will be intelligent-driven and target oriented, is designed to retrieve all illicit weapons in circulation, halt the on-going proliferation of weapons, restore law and order and bring perpetrators to justice.

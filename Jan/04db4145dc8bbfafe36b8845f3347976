Victoria Beckham has ruled out an appearance on the forthcoming Spice Girls tour despite admitting she’ll feel “left out” when it takes place. Speaking to The Guardian the former band member – who is now a full-time fashion designer – said: “I’m excited to see it. And I’m sure when I’m there and they are on stage, there will be a part of me that feels a bit left out. Because even after all this, a part of me will always be a Spice Girl.” Millions of people attempted to purchase tickets for the Spice Girls’ long-awaited reunion tour when sales opened in November. Demand was “off the charts”, according to Andrew Parsons, Ticketmaster’s managing director. They will play sell-out shows at venues, including London’s Wembley Stadium, from May until June.

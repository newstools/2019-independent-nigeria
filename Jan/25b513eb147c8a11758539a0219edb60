German female tennis icon, Steffi Graf has predicted that Serena Williams will surpass Margaret Court’s 24 Grand Slam titles record. Graf believes Serena will surpass the record, even if the American fails to equal the mark at the ongoing Australian Open. Court won 13 of her 24 Grand Slams before the women’s game became fully professional in 1968. Graf said Serena achieved success in the more competitive Open Era and predicts she will finally finish her career as the sport greatest ever. Serena was eight weeks pregnant when she won her 23rd Grand Slam trophy at Melbourne in 2017 but missed opportunities to equal Australian Court on her return from maternity leave. She lost in the final of Wimbledon and the US Open last year but Graf, who won 22 majors in her career, said in Melbourne she still believes in the Williams Wonder Woman. “I don’t know if she can do it here (equal the record) but I believe she can absolutely. Her game, her serve is such an incredible weapon. I think she, at any time, is dangerous. “With the experience, she’s had, she’s still so determined, and if she enjoys it why not? If her body holds up I do believe she has a big chance. “I’d probably say, with the career, she’s had, she’s not even finished at this point, then yes, I’d say so.” Graf spoke just as Serena Williams stepped up her drive for a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam by swatting aside Eugenie Bouchard. Serena is bidding to match Court’s record, and win an eighth in Australia, on her return to Melbourne Park since winning in 2017 while pregnant. The 37-year-old followed up her first-round 49-minute romp by spending just 70 minutes on Rod Laver Arena to dispose of the Canadian 6-2, 6-2. “It wasn’t an easy match. So I knew ‘Serena, you’ve got to come out hot, you’ve got to come out firing, she’s a really good player and I haven’t had many matches since last year,’” Serena concluded.

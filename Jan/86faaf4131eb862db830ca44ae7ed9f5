Round 21 of the 2018/19 Serie A season features a heavyweight battle between Milan and Napoli at the San Siro Stadium on Saturday night, with the hosts looking to boost their UEFA Champions League hopes and put in a dent in the visitors’ title ambitions. The heavyweight clash will be aired live on DStv and GOtv at 8.30pm on SS8 & SelGo5. Last weekend, Napoli defeated Lazio 2-1 at home to remain in contention for the title and will hope that leaders, Juventus, are distracted (especially when the UEFA Champions League resumes next month) to retain hopes of closing the gap. Milan’s search for form continues and is likely to be made harder by the loss of Argentine striker Gonzalo Higuain, a loanee from Juventus, who has joined Chelsea on a six-month loan. Serie A leaders, Juventus, face a tricky away clash to Lazio, who lost away to Napoli last weekend. Juve are familiar with the danger posed by Lazio, but have the know-how to win the game, which is live on SS8 & SelGo5 at 8.30 pm on Sunday). Roma, who boosted their top-four hopes in the last round, have a similarly tough away assignment to Atalanta, who won their last two Serie A matches by a combined score of 11-2. They will be eager to increase their chances of qualifying for the Champions League with a win. The match is live at 3pm on SS8/SS10 & SelGo2/SelGo5 on Sunday. Elsewhere, Internazionale will seek recovery from the underwhelming 0-0 draw with Sassuolo last weekend when they face Torino in a Northern derby (6pm on Sunday on SS8 & SelGo5). Former Arsenal striker, Gervinho, will aim to continue his fine form for Parma when they host SPAL (Sunday, 6pm on SS11). Bologna and Frosinone will meet for a relegation six-pointer at the Stadio Renata Dall’Ara (Sunday, 3pm on SS5). Other fixtures are Sassuolo v Cagliari (SS8 & SelGo5 at 3pm on Saturday), Sampdoria v Udinese – (SS8/SS10 & SelGo2/SelGo5 at 6pm on Saturday), Chievo v Fiorentina (SS8 & SelGo5 at 12.30 pm on Sunday) and Empoli v Genoa (Monday at 8.30pm on SS8 & SelGo5).

AWKA – The Atiku-Obi Campaign Council in Anambra State has said it is worried about the approach of All Progressives Congress (APC) to the 2019 general elections and the preparation for the election by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Chairman of the council and former governorship candidate of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Anambra State, Hon. Oseloka Henry Obaze, said in a press briefing in Awka on Thursday that the party was worried that till now, “APC is rarely campaigning and we are worried over what they have up their sleeves.” Stressing that APC had nothing to campaign about because it could not repeat the promises it failed to implement, Obaze said the party had the obligation to tell Nigerians why it wanted them to vote it into power for the second time. As for PDP, Obaze said all the party needed to do was to canvass and convince people that Alhaji Atiku Abubakar and Peter Obi were the best because the two had been tested in government and proved they could be trusted. He said PDP was worried about the election guidelines, especially as they concerned simultaneous accreditation and voting because, according to him, such would not give party agents the exact figure of how many people that were accredited to vote as it happened in 2015.

Lagos – Professor Abayomi Akinyeye, a professor of History at the University of Lagos (UNILAG) has called on the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to set up an alert about poor governance in countries of the world to a measure to reduce incidences of an insurgency. As part of the measures to stem upsurge in insurgency all over the world by United Nations, Prof Akinyeye advocated for an expansion of the mandate of some UN agencies and the creation of new ones to either become UNHCIDP and , need for the introduction a global insurgency tax to be paid by multinationals to assist the UN in its responses to insurgency financially. This was contained in his paper titled: “The United Nations and Insurgency in Global Perspective: The Need for a Reorientation” presented at the opening of Plenary of the first Covenant  International Model United Nations Conference (CIMUN 2019)  held at the Covenant University, Canaanland, Ota, Ogun State. Akinyeye who also suggested sanctions against both insurgents and governments that hamper UN responses to insurgency attributed rising insurgency globally to quest for equity and social justice, ideologies on how things should be done, saying that a close monitor on the delivery of good governance to guide against inequality will reduce insurgency situations globally. Professor Aaron Atayero, Vice-Chancellor of the university represented by Professor Folarin Sheriff, Head of Department of Political Science and International Relations described the Model United Nations: as a globally accepted innovative way of reproducing and bringing the United Nations to youths in particular and everyday people in general “Our belief in this genius of innovation is the very reason we at Covenant have embraced the traditions and become part of the trajectories of UN model society. Our history at Model United Nations Conference is a long one. At our very first outing in 2007, we beat over 50 participating institutions at the Nigerian Model United Nations Conference (NigMUNS) to emerge as the Best Institution and won several individual awards According to the VC, the theme of the conference, “Restructuring the Future through Innovative Ideas” is instructive and could not have come at a better time and in a better place, saying that the university was founded on innovation as it had dared to do what others do not do.

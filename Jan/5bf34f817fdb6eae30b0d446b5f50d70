AC Milan have left Gonzalo Higuain out of their squad for Monday afternoon’s trip to Genoa in a huge hint that his Chelsea transfer is soon to be resolved. The forward – who is on loan at Milan from Juventus – is not on the list of 23 players that coach Gennaro Gattuso will have to call upon for the game away to the side 14th in Serie A. Higuain came off the bench to play for the final 19 minutes of the Italian Super Cup against his parent club in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday. He is expected to tie up a deal to join the Chelsea in the coming days. Following their 2-0 loss at Arsenal on Saturday, former Blues forward Tony Cascarino says he feels that Maurizio Sarri’s Chelsea tenure could now depend on Higuain’s performances.

Rangers boss Steven Gerrard has admitted tiredness affected some of the Gers’ performances in December and insists the winter break and training camp in Tenerife has been crucial for all at Ibrox. The Light Blues entered the mid-season break on the back of a comprehensive win over rivals Celtic in the OId Firm clash at Ibrox in December. Ryan Jack’s first half strike proved to be the difference between both sides as Rangers went level on points with Celtic, who have a game in hand, at the summit of the league table. Despite managing to secure their best result of the campaign against Celtic, Gerrard conceded that tiredness affected some of Rangers’ performances in December. The Gers boss also insisted his team deserved the break, both mentally and physically, after having played as many as 38 games in the first half of the season. “I think physically and mentally the team and the squad certainly needed the break – and we did as a staff as well because it had been non-stop since June 15 when we came back”, Gerrard told Rangers TV. “38 games in total, it has almost been like a full season crammed into six months, so we were all running on empty in December and I think that showed in some of our results and performances. “We conceded a couple of late goals and, without blaming anything, you do look at the amount of games and the tiredness and mental fatigue and maybe that was the case. “So the timing was perfect. “We gave the players a week off to have family time and really recover, and this week has been really about building them back up and really pushing them physically again to get that base for the second half of the season.” Rangers will return to action against Cowdenbeath in a Scottish Cup fourth round tie on 19th January.

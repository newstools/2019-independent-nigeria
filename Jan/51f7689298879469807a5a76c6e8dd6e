ASABA – Chairman of the Delta Football Association (DFA), Mr Edema Fuludu has raised the alarm over the actions of top leaders in the Delta State Sport Commission to try to hijack the electoral process of the Football Association, contrary to the constitution governing the body. He disclosed this in a press statement after allegations were made against him for misappropriation of funds. He revealed that confrontation and antagonism of his office started since he was accused of drawing up an existing guidelines which to them never existed. According to Fuludu, “Sunday Lucky and Kennett Nwaomucha stopped proceedings insisting that all delegates must be brought by the Delta State Sports Commission. I enunciated the fact that what they are saying is against NFF electoral guidelines which is an adaptation of FIFA guidelines and the DFA electoral guidelines is an adaptation of the NFF,” he said. The Former Super Eagles Player who was alleged of spending monies taken from a new account he opened in the name of the Association has since been suspended after an emergency meeting by a faction of the board. In his response to the allegations, Fuludu stated that he opened a new account because he was not a signatory to the old one upon becoming the Acting Chairman of the Association. He noted that upon his assumption in office, there was a change in the office of the secretary of the Association which resulted in needed change in signatory to the account from the old secretary to the new person in charge. According to Fuludu, “As soon as l receive alert l do an ATM transfer to his personal account to execute matches pending when we perfect his becoming a signatory and l handed the ATM Card to him. We have had issues of network problems that I had to bail out with my own cash and later retrieve. This is the misappropriation. They suddenly woke up after two years to know we had this account running” he lamented.

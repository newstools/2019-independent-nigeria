The FIFA U-17 World Cup-winning goalkeeper in 2015 has been selected by Nigeria along with 20 others as the Flying Eagles yet again hunt for the U-20 Africa Cup of Nations scheduled for 2-17 February in Niger. “Many were called but few were chosen and this is a new challenge for me after playing at the U-17 AFCON in 2015,” Udoh told the CAF website. “We are good to go for this tournament (Niger 2019) because we have a very good team and I think everyone is important in this team.” In Niger, seven-time winners Nigeria will open their account against the Junior Itamba of Burundi at the Stade General Seyni Kountche to be followed with two key ties against South Africa and February 5 and perennial rivals and hosts Mena of Niger three days later. “We don’t need to underrate any team; South Africa is a very good team as well and they defeated us in the U-17 AFCON in 2015 and that was an experience,” Udoh added.” “We would need to fight till the very end because our target is qualification for the World Cup.” Nigeria have finished second twice at the U-20 World Cup finals.

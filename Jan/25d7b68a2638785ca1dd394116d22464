AWKA – Victor Umeh, the senator representing Anambra Central, says that Governor Willie Obiano’s achievements in office should count as a big plus for candidates of the party seeking elective positions. Obi said while campaigning in Oba and Ojoto communities in Idemili South Council Area on Tuesday that such concepts as ‘Community Choose Your Projecs Programme’ in which many communities in the state had executed projects worth N40 million should be seen as ingenious by the government. At Oba in Idemili South, Umeh said he personally intervened in the award of contract for Umuoji-Oba-Oraifite Road. During the rally held at Merchants of Light Secondary School, Oba, Umeh empowered five women with N50, 000.00 each to assist them in their petit businesses. The empowerments were in addition to two of the community’s children that benefitted from his university scholarship scheme and seven youths that were trained in skill acquisition. Umeh promised to parley with the youths of the area who demanded to have a memorandum of understanding on what he would do for them if he returned to the senate. He said if he could do so much in less than one year in the senate, in four years, the youths would carry him shoulder high on entry into the community. The federal lawmaker urged the crowd to vote for him because he is trustworthy and have the ability and educational capacity and consistency in character to represent them effectively. He regretted that Oba people voted against All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in the governorship election and counselled them not to make the same mistake which made them lose being in the mainstream of Anambra politics. He said: “Vote for APGA because we are holding the levers of power till 2022. But if you don’t, blame yourselves”. Umeh also offered similar advice at Ojoto where he was also confronted by similar scenario as in the neighbouring communities of Akwa Ukwu and Oba.

The Police on Wednesday laid charges against a trio of men, who sexually abused not fewer than 24 children, during the course of 10 years at a campground in Central Germany. Police said the men preyed on the children, aged four to 13, producing pornographic material at the campsite. They listed 23 affected children but said they feared that the list could grow. “We still have a lot of work ahead of us,’’ said the head of the investigation, Gunnar Weiss. The three suspects aged 33, 48 and 56 have been detained. Investigators have secured 13,000 files containing child pornography, taking up 14 terabytes of data space. Achim Tietz, another investigator, said the scope of the crimes only became clear as investigators delved further into the case.

YENAGOA  – Over 50 political parties in Bayelsa State, including the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC), have signed a peace accord pledging to ensure peaceful and violence-free elections in the state. The signing of the peace pact was the highpoint of a meeting between the Bayelsa State Police Command and officials of political parties, candidates and officials of the Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC) at the Police Officers’ Mess, Yenagoa, on Thursday. Mr. Aminu Saleh, Commissioner of Police in the state, who presided over the peace forum, explained it was held at the instance of the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu. He said the interactive session with the Bayelsa political class was convened “to discuss areas of friction” in view of the forthcoming polls. CP Saleh, who was flanked by top officers of the command, commended the parties and contestants for so far conducting themselves peacefully in their campaigns as violence had been recorded except an ‘isolated case’ in Nembe area of Bayelsa East Senatorial District. He urged the parties, candidates and their supporters to be guided by the dictates of the Electoral Act and the guidelines of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), and also shun electoral violence and brigandage.

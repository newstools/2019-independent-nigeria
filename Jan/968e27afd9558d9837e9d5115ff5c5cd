Friday night’s Championship game between Leeds United and Derby County has been rocked by an extraordinary spying row after the Rams confirmed that a man apprehended outside of their training centre on Thursday is employed by Leeds. A statement on the club’s official website read: “Derby County Football Club can confirm that officers from the Derbyshire Constabulary were called to the Derby County Training Centre at around 11:20 am on Thursday 10th January 2019 following reports of a man acting suspiciously outside the premises. “It has since been confirmed to Derby County that the individual concerned is an employee of the footballing staff at Leeds United Football Club. The club is now in discussion with Leeds United club officials in relation to this incident. At this time no further comment will be made.”  Frank Lampard was forced to stop training on Thursday after spotting a man in plain clothes using a pair of binoculars to observe his session. Police later apprehended the man and confirmed he also had a pair of pliers on his person as well as binoculars. There were also suspicions that this was an attempt by the man to pass information on to Leeds and it is still being established whether he was working on behalf of the club.

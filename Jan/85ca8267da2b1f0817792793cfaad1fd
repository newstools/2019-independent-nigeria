OWERRI – Governor of Imo State and chairman, Progressives Governors’ Forum, Rochas Okorocha, has urged Nigerians to be positive about 2019, hoping that 2019 would favour the nation and her people. Sam Onwuemeodo, chief press secretary to the governor, in a press release on Monday, noted that no nation grew with the citizenry being negative about the progress of the nation. He, therefore, called on Nigerians to see light at the end of the tunnel with regard to 2019, especially over the nation’s politics, economy, unity and development. The governor, however, noted that the year 2018 was not a bad year when scrutinized. He, therefore, asked Nigerians to be grateful to God for His goodness in 2018 and also pray that 2019 would be far better than 2018. “I assure Imo people that my government will continue to work till the end of my tenure in 2019. I also remark that most of the things my administration promised to do, have been done”, the release added. The governor, however, noted that in the year 2018 the people of the state enjoyed peace and security and assured that his government should not relent in these regards. “I, therefore, wish Imo people in particular and Nigerians in general, a prosperous New Year”, the release said.

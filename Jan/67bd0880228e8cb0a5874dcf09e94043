Lagos – After coming close twice to win the Men’s Player of the Year award in Africa, Sadio Mane has said he will not give up the fight until he wins the award. Reacting to his first runner-up position at the end of Tuesday’s presentation of the award to Mohammed Salah, Mane promised to continue doing his best to win the trophy. “I will do my best to win the trophy for best player next year. I won’t let go and I will fight for it. I congratulate the winner, Mohamed Salah, and on the collective level, our agreement is very beneficial for Liverpool in our league title bid in England and in the UEFA Champions League (UCL). “With the national team, all Senegalese are expecting us to win the ultimate at the next Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt, and we will work to achieve that”, he said. Mane came second behind Salah while Pierre-Emerick Aubamyeang (Arsenal and Gabon), winner in 2015, placed third. Meanwhile, Salah said winning the award for two consecutive years was really huge and very proud to have won the award again. “I am proud and very honoured to be nominated for the second time. It was not obvious, for the first time, I was told that it was not going to happen and it’s done and this year, we had to confirm and that’s good. “As a child, I always dreamt of the Best Player award, but winning in two consecutive years is really huge. These titles I will share with all those who contributed to my football training, my coaches.” “My joy is even greater with the designation of Egypt as the organizing country of the next edition of the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). “With the support of the fans, we will aim for an 8th crown for our country. And it would be nice to see the public come back en masse in the stadiums and thus allow a new cycle of victories”, said Salah.

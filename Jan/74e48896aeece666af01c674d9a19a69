Atiku Abubakar, presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), on Wednesday said he will sell the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), which he called a “mafia organisation,” and attract private investors to drive economic growth and create jobs if he wins office next month. “I will liberalize the economy to create jobs,” Abubakar said during a conference in Lagos. “I will reduce the size of the Federal Government completely and hand over the responsibilities” to the states, he said. “I have been creating jobs for so many years,” Abubakar said, noting that “I am committed to privatising the NNPC even if they are going to kill me, I will do it.” He also said he planned to reserve 30 percent of his appointments for women and to focus on rebuilding Nigeria’s education system. “As far as I am concerned everything is based on education,” he said. “Our governments have really neglected education and pushed it to the back-burner of their policies.” He also said he would appoint a new central bank governor and float the naira if he wins next month’s election. Godwin Emefiele is not doing a good job, Abubakar said, adding that he’d make the change when the governor’s first term ends in June. “I don’t think he’s pursued the right policies,” he said in an interview in Lagos. “We have to have the right people in there.” Talking on the Federal Government and election, he said, “Fears of rigging are credible. I have never seen, since 1999, a government so repressive and anti-democratic.” “The president doesn’t even know what’s going on around him,” Abubakar said. “He’s aloof. You can see that he’s clueless in the way the country’s been governed since he came to office.”

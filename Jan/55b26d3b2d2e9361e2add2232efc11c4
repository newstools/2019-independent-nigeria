This incident occurred during Spurs’ clash with Man United at Wembley, which they lost 1-0.
Things have gone from bad to worse for Tottenham after their defeat to Man United. Adding insult to injury to the club’s name, Spurs’ own fans have been accused of targetting Son Heung -min. This is according to Goal’s global editor-in-chief James Dickens, who is a Spurs season-ticket holder. He claimed on Twitter that the South Korean ace was the victim of racial abuse from one home fan in the 1-0 loss to the Red Devils. He tweeted out the incident, writing: “I’ve not experienced racism at football for about 15 years. But today at Tottenham was hideous. Reported to stewards, confronted him myself and was called a c*nt. While I was standing next to my son. Hideous.” I’ve not experienced racism at football for about 15 years. But today at @SpursOfficial was hideous. Reported to stewards, confronted him myself and was called a c*nt. While I was standing next to my son. Hideous. The north London outfit is now investigating the situation, which Dickens confirmed on social media. This will only bring the Premier League side’s fanbase under the microscope once more after a previous incident at the Emirates Stadium brought criticism. One fan threw a banana peel on the pitch in reaction to Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scoring and celebrating a goal in the 4-2 loss to Arsenal back in December. That man was handed a ban by the club, but it remains to be seen what the culprit on Sunday will be met with. Pochettino called for racism to be killed in football after that unfortunate north London derby but it doesn’t appear to be anywhere near its end. Sadly, the ugly side of the beautiful game lives on.

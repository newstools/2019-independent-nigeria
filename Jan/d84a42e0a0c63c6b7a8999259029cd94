Aston Villa striker, Tammy Abraham has been hit with startling and very scary information that his desire for a transfer in the January window could be blocked by FIFA. Though the Nigerian-born star is eager to make the best of his current form on loan from Chelsea to the English Championship club, his transfer aspirations might be scuttled by existing rules. Details of the report out of England indicate that the 21-year-old lad is at the centre of a regulation that forbids players from starring for more than two clubs within a particular season. Consequently, Tammy must learn whether an appearance he made in August for Chelsea’s youth team in the English Premier League against Derby County was a competitive match or not. Should that game be adjudged competitive, then it would rule Tammy out of a January move, since he would not be allowed to play for a third club this season. FIFA regulations state that players are not allowed to feature for three clubs in a season and Tammy stands to come up against a road block, as he was loaned to Villa after playing for The Blues’ under-23 squad. Tammy is now facing a similar scenario that saw French star, Hatem Ben Arfa have his registration delayed at Nice four years ago. He joined the French club from Hull but FIFA ruled his one appearance for Newcastle United’s under-21s as an official match. Subsequently, the France midfielder had to wait till the following season before making his debut for his new club. This would, therefore, be a huge setback in Tammy’s hopes of joining retired Super Eagles goalkeeper, Carl Ikeme’s former club, Wolverhampton Wanderers this month. Wolves are prepared to take Tammy on a permanent deal to boost Nuno Espirito Santo’s attack, but FIFA regulations might scuttle that move.

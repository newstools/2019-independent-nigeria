They started dating in 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy actor Chris Pratt has announced his engagement to his girlfriend Katherine Schwarzenegger, just months after they started dating. Chris, who reportedly started dating Katherine in June 2018, following his split with his ex-wife Anna Farris in 2017, announced the couple’s happy news on Instagram this morning (Monday 14th January). Sharing a cute photo of the pair, with Katherine showing off her massive ring, Chris wrote ‘Sweet Katherine, so happy you said yes! I’m thrilled to be marrying you. Proud to live boldly in faith with you. Here we go! ♥️’. [sic] Fans were quick to comment on the photo, congratulating the couple on their happy news. One user wrote, ‘Congrats man’, with another adding, ‘Congratulations! May God bless you both!’.

Chris and Katherine’s happy news comes just months after Chris finalised his divorce with his ex-wife, actress Anna Farris. The pair, who were married for eight years, announced their shock split in August 2017, with a joint statement. Chris wrote on his social media accounts, ‘Anna and I are sad to announce we are legally separating. We tried hard for a long time, and we’re really disappointed. Our son has two parents who love him very much and for his sake we want to keep this situation as private as possible moving forward. We still have love for each other, will always cherish our time together and continue to have the deepest respect for one another.’ [sic] © Anna Farris and Chris Pratt © Getty Images
Despite the split, the pair remained good friends, with Chris later going on to announce he was dating Katherine in June 2018. Congratulations to Chris and Katherine on their happy news!

Lagos – Alex Aghahowa, the Lobi Stars midfielder, has said that the February 1 CAF Champions League match against Wydad Casablanca of Morocco in Enugu would be a litmus test for his side, who will look to bounce back from their defeat in Abidjan on Saturday. After starting brightly in a 2-1 win over Mamelodi Sundown of South Africa in match-day one of the 2019 CAF Champions League, the Ortom Boys saw their wings clipped in the match-day two against ASEC Mimosas in a 0-1 loss in Abidjan. They will welcome the group leaders, Wydad, in match-day three in Enugu on February1. Wydad, it will be recalled, lost at home to Sundown also at the weekend. Speaking on their match against the Moroccans, Aghahowa acknowledged that North Africans are always hard to play but promised that the Nigerian champions would give their best. “We are so unlucky not to have gotten a point away from home. We thank God for everything, though we lost the match, it’s done and dusted, we are coming back home to get prepare for the match against Wayda Casablanca come February 1st.” “That will be another litmus test for us, North African side are really very a difficult side, but we will give it our best, our head is up for the next match.

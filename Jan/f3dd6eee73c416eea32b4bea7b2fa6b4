Ariana Grande’s new single “7 Rings” has set a new record for most streams in a single week. According to Official Charts, the song was played 16.9m times last week, beating previous record holder Mariah Carey, whose song “All I Want for Christmas is You” received 15.m plays in a week last December. “7 Rings” is also the first single to sell more than 100,000 copies since the Grenfell charity single in June 2017, shifting 126,000. Grande’s song is a tongue-in-cheek hymn to retail therapy, inspired by a trip to Tiffany’s last year when she bought her friends matching diamond rings. It riffs on The Sound of Music’s ”My Favourite Things”. It was accompanied by a pink neon-drenched video , which has been viewed more than 72m times. Grande recently revealed the tracklist, cover and release date of her forthcoming album Thank U, Next. The 12-track record will feature the previously released singles “Imagine”, “7 Rings” and the title track, as well as new songs “NASA”, “ghostin’” and “break up with your girlfriend, i’m bored”. Grande said the album will be out on 8 February.

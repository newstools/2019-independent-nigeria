Jos – Adams Oshiomhole, Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has called for the probe of former President Olusegun Obasanjo and ex-Vice President Atiku Abubakar tenure for allegedly spending $16 billion on power in the country with no proof that such money was spent on electricity generation. Oshiomhole, who was the guest of honour at the flag-off of Governor Simon Lalong’s re-election campaign at Jos Township Stadium, said the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) 16 years in power was a waste alleging  that Nigerians became poorer under Obasanjo regime and Goodluck Jonathan  as a result of  their failure  to put the interests of Nigerians first before any other considerations. He accused PDP Presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar of heading  the privatisation of federal government organisations under President Obasanjo eight years in power during which thousands of workers lost their jobs while few top government officials allegedly took away federal owned companies at a give-away price. According to the APC national chairman while President Buhari can travel to any country of the world, Atiku Abubakar could only afford to travel to Dubai because of fear of being quizzed by foreign security agencies. He urged Plateau people to come out en mass in February and the month of March to vote for President Buhari  and  Governor Lalong to be re-elected as president and governor respectively at the federal and state levels of government. Governor Lalong on his part said he has no opponent  on the Plateau because  his main challenger  Senator Jeremiah Useni  is not his match in politics, saying  PDP is dead on the Plateau now that Ambassador Chris Giwa  has  left the party to join APC in the state. During the re-election campaign, some political parties in the state endorsed Governor Lalong as their candidate for  2019 governorship election.

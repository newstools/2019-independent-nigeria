The National Pension Commission (PenCom) has been awarded the Outstanding Regulator of the Year 2018 by the Independent Newspapers Limited, publishers of DAILY INDEPENDENT Newspapers, Saturday Independent and Sunday Independent. At the event which took place last week Thursday at the prestigious Eko Hotel and Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos, the organisers of the award noted that “The honour was in recognition of PenCom’s relentless pursuit of excellence in regulating the pension industry.” The Commission was extolled for its strides in implementing the Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS), and other developmental initiatives in moving pension administration to new heights. The award was received on behalf of the Commission by the Secretary /Legal Adviser Mr. Muhammad Sani Muhammed, Head, Corporate Communications Department, Mr. Peter Aghahowa and Principal Manager, South West Zonal Office, Mr. Akinsola Adeseun. It would be recalled that under the stewardship of Mrs. Aisha Dahir-Umar, Ag. Director General, the Commission had witnessed innovations such as Pension Enhancement for retirees under the Programmed Withdrawal and the Multi-Fund Structure amongst others. Public confidence and acceptability of the CPS have soared and membership has grown to 8.41 million contributors as at December 2018. The scheme has accumulated up to N8.50 trillion as at November 2018 and a total of 260,808 retirees are receiving monthly pensions regularly. The Commission is poised to bring the informal sector into the Contributory Pension Scheme, through the Micro Pension Plan. This Plan avails pension services to self-employed persons and persons working in organisations with less than three employees.

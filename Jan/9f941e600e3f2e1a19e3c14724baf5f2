Lagos – The President, FADAMA in Ojo Federal Bolujoko Adenike, Constituency, has advised Nigerian farmers to ensure they cast their votes for those who have their interest at heart and those that will support the nation’s agricultural development as the general elections draws near. She gave the advice while speaking at a one-day farmers’ forum organised by FADAMA Federated Community Association, Ojo Chapter, All Farmers Association of Nigeria and (AFAN), Ojo Chapter and HEDA Resource Centre in Lagos. She also warned the farmers not to sell their votes that anyone caught in the act would be punished accordingly, stressing that it is very important for the farmers to take their destiny into their hand by choosing leaders who will support them. “We farmers will not sell our votes to any politician, rather we will vote for those we know have the farmers’ interest at hearts. “Any politician who wants our votes will tell us what they will do to support us. They should tell us what they have in mind for us. Gone are the days when politicians will come and deceived the farmers to vote them into power and at the end of the day nothing will come out of it. “Politicians can no longer buy our vote, and we are not even ready to sell ours. Let them come and show us the place of farmers in their various manifesto. They should talk to us on what they are going to contribute in agriculture sector, if they are elected, so that hunger can be a thing of the past in Lagos State and in this country,” she added.

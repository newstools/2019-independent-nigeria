World No. 2 Rafael Nadal will focus on getting fit for the Australian Open after pulling out of the Brisbane International with a thigh strain. The 32-year-old Spaniard will nurse the “dangerous” injury he picked up playing in Abu Dhabi in late December until he possibly lines up next week in the hit-and-giggle FAST4 Showdown in Sydney next week. “I still wanted to play,” Nadal told reporters on Wednesday. “But all the recommendations from the doctors … (were if) I play here, there is a risk, important risk to don’t have the chance to play Melbourne. “I can’t do my 100 percent. “It’s a very small thing, but can become a big thing.” The 17-time grand slam champion was due to play his opening Brisbane clash on Thursday — his first ATP tournament match since pulling out of the U.S. Open semifinals in September with an ongoing knee complaint. He lost to South African Kevin Anderson in his only match at the Mubadala exhibition last week, withdrawing from the event after the defeat. As for the Australian Open, Nadal sees himself in a better position than 12 months ago when he entered the major on the back of just one match in almost three months due to more knee issues.

ABUJA – National Association of Nigerian Traders (NANTS) has cautioned the Federal Government to desist from further negotiations and subsequent signing of e-commerce agreement at the World Trade Organisation. Bar. Ken Ukaoha, President of NANTS, who stated this in Abuja at a media briefing on the implications of Nigeria’s participation and position on the e-commerce discussions at the World Trade Organisation, expressed displeasure that Nigerian government had begun e-commerce negotiations with Friends of e-Commerce for Development without due and prior consultations with stakeholders at home on the benefits or otherwise of such agreements or membership. It would be recalled that Nigerian through her representatives at the 11th WTO Ministerial Conference(MC 11) held in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in December 2017, had committed the country to some agreements such as the European Free Trade Association Joint Declaration on Corporation, Friends of Investment Facilitation for Development and Friends of E-Commerce for Development.

Mrs. Jennifer Atiku, wife of the PDP presidential candidate, Abubakar Atiku, has assured that the Federal Government under her husband 2019 would ensure uninterrupted education calendar. Mrs. Atiku gave the assurance in her remarks at the flag-off of the Edo Central Senatorial campaigns by the party on Sunday in Uromi, Esan North East Local Government Area of Edo State. She said that a PDP government would ensure that students who “are presently out of school due to the lingering ASUU strike get back to their classrooms.” She also said that a PDP government would create environment for businesses to thrive with a view to ensuring that the citizens were lifted above poverty. Addressing the gathering, the state chairman of the party, Dan Orbih, said the party had enjoyed unbroken support from Esan people since 1999. Orbih, who said the party was on a mission to rescue the country, added that every member of the party would go back to their various council areas, wards and units in Esan land to preach the gospel of rescuing Nigeria. He urged the people to come out en masse to vote PDP and ensure that their votes counted and defended. He further said that the election wasn’t about PDP but about securing a better future for Nigerians and the nation’s hard earned democracy. He also criticised the appointment of Amina Zakari, who is alleged to be a very close relative of President Buhari, as head of INEC’s collation centre. Zakari has, however, since denied the allegation, saying she was not related to Buhari. The chairman said INEC, like Caesar’s wife, must not only be above board, but must also be seen to be above board. “INEC must do the needful by listening to the cries of Nigerians to ensure the forthcoming elections are not only free and fair but transparent and credible,” he said.

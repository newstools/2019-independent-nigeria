Gbenga Ogunbote, the head coach of Rangers International, has stated that his target this season in the CAF Confederations Cup is to help the Flying Antelopes reach the semifinal stage of the competition. Rangers qualified for the group stage of the second tier continental competition after defeating Bantu FC of Lesotho 4 – 2 on aggregate in the group stage play offs. The team’s first group match will be against Salitas FC of Burkina Faso in February of 2019. Ogunbote, who tutored Sunshine Stars of Akure to a semifinal finish in the 2012 CAF Confederations Cup, has stated that his target is not to fall below his previous positions at the championship; “The truth of the matter is that I’ve always set a target for myself. I’ve played on the continent before and my worst result has been the semifinal both in the CAF Champions League and CAF Confederations Cup. “I have set that standard and if I want to see myself to have done anything worthwhile on the continent, I must not fall below the standard. This time, I will like to get to the finals and for the league I’ve always love to finish in a very appreciable position.” Rangers will face CS Sfaxien of Tunisia, Etoile Du Sahel also of Tunisia and Salitas of Burkina Faso in group B of the competition in the draw conducted on Monday at the CAF headquarters in Cairo. The Flying Antelopes so far are unbeaten in six games in the competition winning five with just a draw.

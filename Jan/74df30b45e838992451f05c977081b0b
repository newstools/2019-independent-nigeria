A list of criminal allegations against Justice Water Onnoghen has been sent to the National Judicial Council. The NJC is expected to hold an emergency meeting today. According to reports, the office of the Attorney General of the Federation sent the list of allegations. It was gathered that the allegations against Justice Onnoghen, included bank statements and title deeds of properties said to have been traced to him. It was learnt that the fresh allegations submitted to the NJC were different from those sent to the Code of Conduct Tribunal. It will be recalled that the FG earlier said that “Some have argued that the Justice Onnoghen issue should have been referred to the NJC to handle. “They would have been right if Justice Onnoghen had been accused of professional misconduct, which is what is within the purview of the NJC. “The allegations against Justice Onnoghen go beyond professional misconduct. It is the alleged breach of the Code of Conduct for Public Officers. And only one body is statutorily empowered to deal with this: The Code of Conduct Tribunal.” Sources said that neither Justice Onnoghen nor acting CJN Muhammad will preside over the NJC meeting today. Meantime, the Code of Conduct Tribunal adjourned indefinitely on Monday, saying it was obeying an order of the court of appeal

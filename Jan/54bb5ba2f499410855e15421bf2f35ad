Argentine midfielder Alexis Mac Allister is likely to undergo a medical at Brighton later this week, Sky Sports News understands. The 20-year-old is currently at Argentinos Juniors and would likely remain with the South American club on loan until the end of the season if a deal is completed. Mac Allister himself revealed his delight as he confirmed his move to Brighton is close to being finalised. “Just a moment ago my dad told me the deal is done,” he told Argentinian radio station Radio Rivadavia on Monday. “I’m going to have to travel to undergo a medical and be back in time for next Monday. “I wanted to stay here until the summer, luckily they will grant my wish and in June I’ll travel to England. I’m looking forward to settling in the city and very happy to play in the Premier League.” Mac Allister, an attacking midfielder who has featured for the Argentina U20s in 2017, took part in nine games in the Primera Division this season, scoring three goals. Brighton remain seven points off the relegation zone but are without a win in their last three games.

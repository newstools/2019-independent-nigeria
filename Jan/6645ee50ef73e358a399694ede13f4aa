Lagos – The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) on Tuesday said that its Compliance Review Committee (CRC) will meet in January 14-15, 2019 to review Russia’s failure to provide access to laboratory doping data. WADA has given December 31, 2018 as the deadline date for Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) to allow WADA officials access to laboratory doping data, but failed to do so. WADA, therefore, said that as a result it would consider sanctions against RUSADA. RUSADA was stripped of its accreditation in 2015 after a WADA-commissioned report found evidence of widespread state-sponsored doping in Russian athletics. But it was conditionally – and controversially – reinstated in September. Its failure to meet the deadline, however, raises the prospect of Russia being banned from a second consecutive Olympics and remaining shut out of international athletics. The committee will make recommendation to WADA’s Executive Committee on how to proceed. If the CRC recommends declaring RUSADA non-compliant and the ExCo agrees with it, the Russian agency will have the right to challenge that assertion to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. The court has the jurisdiction to hear the case and take the final decision. WADA said it had written to Russia’s Minister of Sport, Pavel Kolobkov, and the Director General of RUSADA, Yury Ganus, to officially notify them of the situation. “The situation is a total joke and an embarrassment for WADA and the global anti-doping system,” Travis Tygart, the CEO of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, said on Tuesday.

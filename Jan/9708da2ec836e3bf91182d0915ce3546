R Kelly used a sex trainer to teach his house full of girlfriends how to please him, an ex has claimed. Asante McGee dated the rapper for two years before fleeing his ‘cult’ house in Georgia, and alleges he had been sleeping with the unnamed coach since she was a teenager. “Her role was to train me and the other girls how to sexually please and satisfy Robert [R Kelly’s real name]. “According to both Robert and her, they had been sexually involved together for 16 years, since she was 14 years old. “As she had been with him for so long, it was like she was the head girl in school,” Asante told the BBC . Unlike the hordes of young women R Kelly is said to have pursued, Asante was 35 when she first met in 2014 when a member of his entourage invited her backstage. At first their relationship was normal, with the pair enjoying romantic meals out and shopping trips – although he was open about the fact she wasn’t his only girlfriend.

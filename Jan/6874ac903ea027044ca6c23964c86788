Abuja – Ataba Sani- Omolori, the Clerk of the National Assembly has been given an award for exemplary performance for the  matured way he averted a national embarrassment that would have prevented President Muhammadu  Buhari from presenting the 2019 budget proposal. Recall that between December 17 and 20, the parliamentary workers, under the aegis of Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria (PASAN), had embarked on a four days warning strike, to demand for payment of their benefit and improved condition of service. The time of the strike had coincided with the date the President was to present the 2019 budget to a joint session of the National Assembly. The honour, according to a letter signed by Dr Yusuf Ibrahim, will be conferred on the Clerk by a United Nation affiliated Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO), Global Association of Christian and Muslim Youth for Peace and Development  in recognition of the exemplary way Omolori managed the recent Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria (PASAN) and National Assembly face-off. The rift, it was noted would had been a great setback to the nation’s democracy if PASAN had shut down the National Assembly. It was gathered that the international NGO with the Sultan of Sokoto, His Eminence, Sa’ad Abubakar 111 (MNI) and His Eminence, Rev, Dr Samson Ayokunle, President, Christain Association of Nigeria (CAN) as its Spiritual  Fathers also intend to recommend Sani-Omolori to President Buhari for a national  award in honour of his patriotism and selfless service to humanity. According to Yusuf, “we share the optimism that with the Clerk in the saddle and with appropriate government support, democratic institutions like the National Assembly can grow to produce legislative professionals that will support growth of Democracy.”

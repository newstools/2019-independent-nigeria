Now whether Callum Hudson-Odoi gets his dream move to Bayern Munich, this transfer window, remains to be seen. But, sat here in the editorial chair, I’d be surprised if all the hype over the move failed to see it materialise. Interestingly, if you believe the media then Chelsea are already eyeing up Hudson-Odoi’s possible replacement. According to the tabloid publication, the Mirror, Chelsea are one of two Premier League clubs, the other being Manchester United, who are taking a hard look at the talented teenager Antoine Semenyo. Semenyo, just 19-years-of-age, is currently on the books of Bristol City but is currently on loan at Newport County where he has caught the eye, scoring six goals this term. In a recent live televised FA Cup tie, against Leicester City, in which Newport beat their more illustrious Premier League opposition, Semenyo was particularly impressive. Born in London, our referenced source suggests that the player could be available for as little as a £2 million compensation fee. But, whether he has as much talent as Hudson-Odoi remains the big question.

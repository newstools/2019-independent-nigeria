Liverpool have received a huge injury boost ahead of their clash with Leicester City with the news that midfielder Fabinho has returned to training, as reported by the Mirror. The Brazilian limped off with a hamstring injury in the last few minutes of The Redsâ€™ 4-3 win over Crystal Palace last Saturday. Liverpool were worried that the midfielder could face spell on the sidelines, but those fears have seemingly been allayed and he should be fit and available to start against the Foxes at Anfield next Wednesday evening.  However, there is a chance that the Brazilian star could play at right-back rather than in midfield as Jurgen Klopp has a severe shortage of options in that position. James Milner is suspended for the game after he was sent off against Palace, Joe Gomez has been ruled out for the game and Trent Alexander-Arnold is a serious doubt. Therefore, either Fabinho, who has played at right-back for Monaco and Brazil, or young Rafa Camacho, will start for Liverpool alongside Joel Matip, Virgil van Dijk and Andrew Robertson.

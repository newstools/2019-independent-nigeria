The Business Development Manager Ecleroen GMBH, Ulf Lohse has emphasised the need for Nigeria to boost investment in solar energy to address the lingering power crisis in the country. He spoke at a two-day public forum organised by Econsultants Limited in conjunction with German eclareon GmbH, Ideas Into Energy GmbH and the German Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where he also said Nigeria is competing with over 100 countries of the world for international trade and investment and a stable power supply remains a major booster for foreign direct investments into the country. He expressed that Nigeria has abundant resources to maximise its solar energy potentials but wondered why the country has not utilised 90% of the potentials. He promised that the German government would partner with Nigeria on alternative sources of energy, adding that Germany has been able to solve a large chunk of its energy problem and is willing to support Nigeria with solar power technology that can generate thousands of energy for Nigerians. In his remarks, the Chairman of Econsultants Limited, Akinola Ajibola said that the workshop was aimed at exposing Nigerians to developing solar power solutions.

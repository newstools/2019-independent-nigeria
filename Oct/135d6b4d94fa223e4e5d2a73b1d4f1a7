AC Milan are battling Arsenal in the race to sign PSV sensation Donyell Malen, according to the latest reports. It was reported a fortnight ago by English newspaper the Sunday Mirror that ‘no fewer than 45 clubs’ are interested Malen – of which the Rossoneri are one. PSV ‘believe he is already worth 100 times the sum they paid Arsenal to secure his services’ – meaning he would currently carry a valuation of £50m (€56m). Arsenal and Liverpool have been mentioned as competition by the Mirror, while Barcelona have also been linked. Calciomercato.com recently reported that Milan have taken steps towards trying to win the race though, as the Rossoneri are planning to re-open discussions with his agent Mino Raiola over a deal. English paper the Daily Mail – who cite Tuttosport – claims that Milan are indeed ready to compete with Arsenal for his signature, and that a €56m price tag has indeed been slapped on the talented forward. Malen was in Ajax’s youth academy before moving to Arsenal in 2015, but he spent just two years there before moving to PSV. The 20-year-old has 14 goals and five assists in 17 appearances in all competitions this season, including eight goals in eight Eredivisie outings.

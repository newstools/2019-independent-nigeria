WARRI – Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, Deputy President of the Senate, has congratulated Nigeria’s athlete, Ese Brume for her outstanding performance at the just concluded IAAF World Championships in Doha, Qatar, United Arab Emirates (UAE). In a statement on Monday, Omo-Agege said by her performance, Brume has not only made Delta State in particular proud but also Nigeria. In the congratulatory message issued by his Special Assistant on Sports, Mr. Azania Omo-Agege, the Delta-born Senator commended what he called her optimism, determination and hard work. Although Brume clinched bronze medal in the long jump event at the IAAF World Championships, Omo-Agege insisted that “Her bronze medal feels like gold to the Nigerian people and we hope she inspires an entire generation of Nigerian athletes to win more medals at the World Championships in the future.” While describing her as a role model, Omo-Agege tasked Nigerian youth to emulate her determination, hard work and can-do attitude. “Her (Brume’s) determination and sheer doggedness in holding her nerves to win the bronze medal (Nigeria’s only medal at the world championships) while competing with the world’s best in the women’s long jump gives us absolute joy and pride. “Ese had wept profusely while winning the gold medal at the African Games held earlier in 2019 because she recalled being told four years earlier while she sustained an injury that she would not be able to jump anymore. However, her optimism, determination, and hard work, which are attributes akin to the Nigerian spirit, helped her overcome this obstacle and she has bounced back stronger. “The good people of Delta State and Nigeria at large congratulate her and are extremely proud of her achievement and inspiring comeback. Brume is a role model for Nigerian youth who would be aiming to emulate her determination and hard work”.

Ughelli – Crisis is currently looming in Warri, Warri South Local Government Area of Delta State, following clashes between youths of Okere-Urhobo and youths of Itsekiri over an order to close marketplaces in the metropolis in honour of a deceased monarch. Two persons were reportedly shot, one on Saturday while the other on Sunday morning, when the youth groups engaged each other in a gun battle over the order. A source who identified himself as Magnus Ameh told Daily Independent that the unidentified gunshot victims and several others who were injured during the clash were rushed to an undisclosed hospital. According to Ameh, “The incident forced traders in the market and residential area to flee the vicinity. Hoodlums capitalised on the opportunity to loot shops that were abandoned at the Okere Market. “The clash between youths started on Saturday following an order by the Okere-Urhobo people that all shops be locked in respect of the final rites of passage of their monarch, HRM (Prof.) Oghenero Okumagba, Idama ll. “It was when the Okere-Urhobo youths went to Obahor and Okere market area to enforce the order that they were vehemently resisted by Itsekiri youths. It was during the argument and confrontation that the youths resorted to the use of clubs, guns, and other dangerous weapons.” Confirming the development, the Delta State Commissioner of Police, Adeyinka Adeleke, said nobody was killed during the fracas. He added that it was one person that was shot and hospitalised and not six as was speculated. “Another person was shot and hospitalised on Saturday. They’re fighting because of the burial of the king,” he said.

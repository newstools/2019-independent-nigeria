Award-winning Afro singer Wizkid has shared his new single, “Joro.” The track, written and produced with Northboi, arrives with a new candlelit video shot across England and Nigeria. “Joro” marks Wizkid’s second offering this month alone — a few weeks back, he dropped “Ghetto Love.” Earlier this summer, he appeared alongside Beyoncé, Blue Ivy, and SAINt JHN on The Lion King soundtrack cut “Brown Skin Girl.” There’s still no word as to when his long-anticipated album Made In Lagos is dropping, but the stream of new material seems to suggest something may be in the works.

Ughelli  – The Delta Ijaw Political Machineries (DIPM) has accused the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) of masterminding the rumoured plot to reverse the already nominated board of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). The group warned that any attempt to reverse the already completed nominations for the board of the NDDC would ignite another round of crisis in the Niger Delta. In a statement signed by national coordinator of the group, Stanley Garry, the group stated that the game plan was to replace the list with that of PDP loyalists that would do the bidding of those that had already penetrated the cabal. “Changing the nominated board will repeat the kind of crisis that characterised the relocation of Warri South West LGA headquarters. Reversal of the board will weaken the party ahead of the 2023 elections in the South South region. “The uproar that will greet the reversal will be unprecedented because the nominees are collectively accepted by Niger Deltans. “There are no capable hands better than the current nominees who are indigenes of the Niger Delta,” the group said. The group said the reversal of the nominees in favour of an opposing faction would threaten the existing peace and create political instability in the country. It advised Mr. President to transmit the names of the NDDC board designates to the Senate for confirmation to sustain the current peace in the Niger Delta.

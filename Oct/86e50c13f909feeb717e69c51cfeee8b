AWKA – Governor Willie Obiano of Anambra State, on Monday, sympathised with the Catholic Bishop of Awka Diocese, Most Rev. Paulinus Ezeokafor, following a fire incident that affected part of his office at the weekend. Obiano said he had come to sympathise with the bishop and was happy that no life was lost to the fire. Speaking to newsmen shortly after the visit, the Most Rev. Ezeokafor said he was impressed with the quick response of the governor to the incident, describing it as worthy of emulation. According to him, the fire which affected part of his office, started from the solar inverter. He thanked God that no life and important documents were lost. While praising the governor for the visit, Ezeokafor said: “I was surprised to receive a call from the governor on the fire incident that occurred because I didn’t know he was already aware. “I was still trying to calm my nerves to get the details because I don’t like working under shocks when he insisted he must come to see things himself. “His coming here was not just to look at things but to see what he can do. And I’m sure something is in the pipeline.” The press secretary to the bishop, Abuchi Onwumelu, who took journalists round the affected areas, said the inferno which started at about 5pm, and was put off by men of the state fire service following a distress call.

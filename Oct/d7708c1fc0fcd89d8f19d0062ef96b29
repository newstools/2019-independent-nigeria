Desirous of empowering physically-challenged persons in the state, the Lagos Waste Management Authority (LAWMA) has engaged the services of 20 challenged persons as sweepers of pedestrian bridges across the state. Managing Director of LAWMA, Dr. Muyiwa Gbadegesin, said the authority is also keen on integrating them into its vision of a cleaner and livable environment, as it has also stepped up its drive to rid the state of waste. “So it has become necessary to engage all stakeholders, including physically challenged persons. “The cleanliness of the Lagos State is a collective responsibility. We need all hands to be on deck to help us realise our vision of building a cleaner city which we all will be proud of. That is why we have decided to engage these special sweepers to play their own part in achieving this,” he said. Dr. Gbadegesin, pointed out that LAWMA had engaged the services of the disabled sweepers, instead of leaving them to beg on the streets, adding that they would be assigned to clean various pedestrian bridges in the state. He said: “We have mapped out pedestrian bridges where they will be operating such as Ojota New Bridge, Alausa Secretariat Bridge, Ikeja Along Bridge, CMS Bridge, Palm Groove bridge, Oshodi Oke bridge, Anthony Bus Stop and others. They will ensure that these locations are always cleaned up during the day.” The LAWMA boss noted that 20 of them have been employed by the authority, with plans to employ more while urging the sweepers to contribute their own quota towards establishing environmental sustainability in the state. He implored residents to support the efforts of government at restoring environmental dignity, adding that the Authority would not rest on its oars until effective sanitation was entrenched in every part of the metropolis.

VITALIS UGOH CALABAR – Operators of the digital system switch over of Nigeria from analogue to digital have expressed concern over the delay by the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) in releasing its timetable as well as funds approved for the execution of the exercise nationwide. The delay has been giving the stakeholders a lot of concerns given the fact that they have done so much both in production of set boxes and provision of satellite services in the country. These concerns was raised by the Group Managing Director, Gospel Digital Technology, operating within the Calabar Free Export Zone (FEZ), Sir Godfrey Ohuabunwa, while conducting the team members from the NBC around the factory. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network He said the project for Nigeria to migrate from analogue to digital would cost N45billion, out of which N15 billion had been approved, but yet to be released. Ohuabunwa stated that any attempt by the Federal Government and the NBC not to heed the call, the company would risk the chance of losing a total amount of $50 million given the amount of efforts invested in the project. He further stated that management of digital technology has so far sank a total $22 for production of mother boards for android phones, television sets and others. “If this digital switch over fails to take place, more than $50,000 will be lost on our own side, not to talk of other people, he warned”.

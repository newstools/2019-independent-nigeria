The Edo State House Assembly has passed the state Sports Commission bill into law one year after the Commission was created by Governor Godwin Obaseki. The House, sitting in Benin City on Wednesday, concluded the Third and final reading of the bill to give legal backing to the Commission headed by Barrister Godwin Dudu-Orumen, which came into being via an executive order by the governor after scrapping the then Ministry of Sports. Although the bill was sent to the immediate past House, no action was taken on it until the present House led by Speaker Franklin Okiye came on board following the March 2019 elections. By this development, the Commission is set to become a legal entity able to sue and be sued. This will happen once Governor Godwin Obaseki assents to the bill, which the Speaker of the House, Hon. Franklin Okiye, said would be forwarded to him immediately. Dudu-Orumen, has described members of the Assembly as worthy sons of the state committed to its progress and development. Dudu-Orumen, who spoke yesterday shortly after the House concluded the third and final reading, said â€œThis is a momentous day in the annals of sports development in Edo State. From this day on, the fortunes of sports in the state can only improve.

A British teenager who is accused of lying she was gang-raped in Cyprus has appeared in court for the start of her trial. The woman, 19, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is facing a public mischief charge over her claim she was sexually assaulted by 12 Israelis at a hotel in Ayia Napa in July. She denies she made false rape allegations. Her lawyers revealed she was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) when she arrived at Famagusta District Court in Paralimni on Wednesday. Her rape case fell apart when police could not find any evidence she had been attacked and officers later claimed she retracted the allegations. Authorities freed five Israelis on July 25 and the rest were released three days later.

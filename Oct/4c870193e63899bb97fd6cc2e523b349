Yenagoa – Barely five months to the end of his tenure in February 2020, Governor Seriake Dickson has appointed 60 new Special Advisers to serve in the Bayelsa State government. He has appointed no fewer than 2,350 political aides since he won re-election in 2015/2016, despite complaining that revenue allocations to the state were dwindling precariously. A statement on Thursday by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Mr. Fidelis Soriwei, said the governor approved the appointments “as part of deliberate efforts to enable the restoration government to finish strong.” Soriwei said the new 60 political appointees, who were drawn from all the eight local government areas of the state, would be sworn in on Monday next week.

It is, however, believed in some quarters that the additional appointments were aimed at shoring up the strength of the Peoples Democratic Party ahead of the November 16governorship election. Soriwei said the governor has directed the caucuses of the PDP to nominate women for appointment as special advisers next week, in areas where they have not been considered for appointment. The statement said the government and the party deplored the ungrateful and unpatriotic attitude of a few appointees who have been sustained and recognized in the midst of far more qualified persons for over seven years but had defected to the opposition.

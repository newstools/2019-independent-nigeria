Cristiano Ronaldo is on the brink of yet another milestone in his incredible career. If he scores two goals against Luxembourg in Portugal’s Euro 2020 qualifier on Friday night it will take him to the landmark of 700 career goals. Not only will he have reached the target before his great rival Lionel Messi, but he will become just the sixth ever footballer to do so. READ ALSO: C.

He currently sits on 698 goals, 26 more than his Barcelona rival, who has 672. Injury permitting, you wouldn’t bet against the Argentine before the end of the season. But it is Ronaldo who will, surely, get their first. A brace will put him in the 700 club with Josef Bican, Romario, Pele, Ferenc Puskas and Gerd Muller.

The important thing is to help the team. ‘I scored in Serbia and four in Lithuania so I’m happy.’ Portugal are second in Group B of European qualifying, five points behind Ukraine with a game in hand as they bid to defend their title next summer.

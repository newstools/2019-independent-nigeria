YENAGOA – Barely five months to the end of his tenure in February 2020, Governor Seriake Dickson, has appointed 60 new special advisers to serve in the Bayelsa State government. He has appointed no fewer than than 2,350 political aides since he won re-election in 2015/2016, despite complaining that revenue allocations to the state were dwindling precariously. A statement on Thursday by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Mr. Fidelis Soriwei, said the governor approved the appointments “as part of deliberate efforts to enable the restoration government finish strong.” Soriwei said the new 60 political appointees, who were drawn from all the eight local government areas of the state, would be sworn in on Monday next week.

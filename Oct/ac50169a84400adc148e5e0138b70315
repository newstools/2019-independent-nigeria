UMUAHIA – Abia State government has warned that the sledge hammer awaits any Director or officers in the state Public Service, who go contrary to the Public Service Rule to becoming Permanent Secretaries in the state Civil Service. According to a release signed by Public Relations Officer in the Office of the State Head of Service in Umuahia, the Head of Service, Sir Onyii Wamah, observed with disappointment and unholy measures some directors and officers adopt in their quest to be appointed Permanent Secretaries, there by deviating from the laid down rules and norms of Public Service made it clear that the promotion of Permanent Secretaries is not obtained by crook and hook but earned by merit , hard work, loyalty, competence, professionalism and discipline. Wamah stated that it is very wrong and unacceptable for some serving Directors and officers to use politicians, clergymen and other highly placed personalities in and outside the state to mount undue pressure for their appointment as Permanent Secretaries without following the laid down procedures as provided in the State Schedule of Responsibilities. He expressed fear that such trend would breed unhealthy rivalry, insincerity, and nepotism, unproductive in the Civil Service if allowed to continue unabated.

A netizen, @AbdulHerphyz, has uploaded pictures of a bridge that supposedly connects Ilorin to some outskirt villages. While noting that bridge is from the Colonial Era, from which Nigeria celebrated 59 years of freedom from yesterday, the tweep bemoaned the presence of such subpar infrastructure on a federal road, no less. This is Moro bridge, you’ll cross it on your way from ilorin to my village, igbeti/kishi. This is 2019 and we still have a colonial era infrastructure on such a major road. It’s a federal road. Completely unacceptable. I’m aware contractors are on the road but not presently. pic.twitter.com/JtRtbVKfQq — Wengerian (@AbdulHerphyz) October 2, 2019

A netizen,Â @AbdulHerphyz, has uploaded pictures of a bridge that supposedly connects Ilorin to some outskirt villages. While noting that bridge is from the Colonial Era, from which Nigeria celebrated 59 years of freedom from yesterday, the tweep bemoaned the presence of such subpar infrastructure on a federal road, no less.

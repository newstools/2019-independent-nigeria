LAGOS – The Nigerian Airspace Man­agement Agency (NAMA) has completed the installa­tion of a Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) station at Jos airport, Plateau State. NAMA in a statement by Mr. Khalid Emele, its Gen­eral Manager, Public Af­fairs said that with the in­stallation of the equipment, the agency had successfully integrated the Very High Frequency (VHF) radio into the network in the sector. The statement hinted that the installation of the facility was concluded about a week ago. It added that the installation was also in line with its resolve to totally eliminate blind spots in the nation’s airspace. Speaking on this devel­opment, Capt. Fola Akin­kuotu, the Managing Direc­tor, NAMA, said this new installation had greatly im­proved the upper airways radio communication in the North East sector to the delight of air traffic controllers and pilots alike. He expressed optimism that the challenge of radio blind spots in some parts of the nation’s upper airspace would soon be history as the ongoing massive de­ployment of VSAT network and VHF radio systems em­barked upon by the agency was yielding positive results. He noted that the Jos – Obudu corridor, which had experienced radio blind spots over time, had to be tackled headlong because of the in­tense traffic on that axis, even as he commended NAMA engineers for addressing the problem with the installation of the new VSAT terminal. Akinkuotu said under the ongoing Automatic Identification System (AIS) Automation project, the In­stallation of VSAT stations had been completed in La­gos, Abuja, Port Harcourt, NAMA headquarters and Jos, while that of Kano VSAT master station would commence by next week. He also stressed that the installation of the VSAT stations would be done in 26 airports, while the VHF radios would be installed in 14 strategic remote sites to finally eliminate radio blind spots in the upper air­ways segment of the entire Nigerian airspace.

LAGOS – Professor Magnus Kpakol, former economic adviser to former President Goodluck Jonathan, has said that the country cannot afford to have any strike from labour union because of the negative impact it would have on the already fragile economy. The former economic adviser said when the negotiation was ongoing, he did not think the negotiators considered holistically all the cadres of people that should be accommodated. He said it was most likely that during their talk, they looked at the people on the lower cadre alone. He said he was not sure government had the revenue for wage increment across board. Kpakol had on African Independent Television (AIT), on Thursday, stressed that labour had a right to be paid the minimum wage and government on its part should understand that it could not afford a strike now, considering the fragile economic state of the country. He said that government must find a way to tackle the issue. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network

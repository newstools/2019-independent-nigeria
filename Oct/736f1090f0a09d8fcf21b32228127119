Iranian women will be allowed to watch the national soccer team play on Thursday for the first time in over 40 years, but campaigners are not convinced the match against Cambodia heralds a wider opening up of sports by the government. Under pressure from world governing body FIFA, Iranian authorities have allocated seats to women in four sectors of Tehran’s 78,000 capacity Azadi Stadium.

Powered by RubiQube Ad Network But a leading activist said FIFA should have pushed Iranian authorities harder and sooner to adhere to its anti-discrimination rules. “The thing that happened to Sahar, FIFA were sort of responsible for that, because they knew this for years and they should’ve done it a lot sooner,” said ‘Sara’, whose Open Stadiums group has campaigned for women’s access for 15 years. “Sahar had that tragedy but also so many others went through interrogations, they went to jail, just because they wanted to watch football.” Because protesters have faced repression in Iran, ‘Sara’ uses a pseudonym and asked for her voice to be distorted in a television interview with Reuters to protect her identity. Around 3,000 women’s’ tickets for the World Cup qualifier were snapped up when they went on sale last week and FIFA had said it expected more to be released, but no additional seats had been made available by Wednesday. Iranian women have been banned from stadiums hosting men’s soccer matches since just after the 1979 Islamic revolution. Dubbed “Blue Girl” online for her favourite team Esteghlal’s colours, Khodayari had feared being jailed for six months by the Islamic Revolutionary Court for trying to enter a stadium dressed as a man.

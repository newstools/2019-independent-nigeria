Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani have also tried to raise suspicions about Hunter Biden’s business dealings in China, leaning on the writings of conservative author Peter Schweizer. But there is no evidence that the former vice president benefited financially from his son’s business relationships. Trump’s requests for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to dig up dirt on Biden, as well as Giuliani’s conduct, are at the centre of an intelligence community whistleblower complaint that sparked the House Democratic impeachment probe last week.  The President’s reference to China came unprompted in an unrelated question about the July 25 Ukraine call and moments after he was asked about trade negotiations with China to end a year-long trade war that has been a drag on both nation’s economies. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The US President has lashed out at a reporter on live television over a question about the Ukraine phone call. “I have a lot of options on China, but if they don’t do what we want, we have tremendous, tremendous power,” Trump said. He later alleged without evidence that China had a “sweetheart deal” on trade with the US because of the Bidens. “You know what they call that,” Trump said. “They call that a pay-off.” Trump’s comments came as he publicly acknowledged that his message to Zelensky and other officials was to investigate the 2020 Democratic presidential contender. Trump’s accusations of impropriety are unsupported by evidence.

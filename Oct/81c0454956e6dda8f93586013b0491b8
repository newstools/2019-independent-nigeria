“Young Teachers, the Future of the Profession.” Ukpong who was grossly disappointed at the low turnout of government functionaries at the event explained that young professional teachers would not accept the current debilitating situation where top government officials and those who matter fall over themselves trying to be counted at other professional associations’ functions, while looking down on teacher’s events. He said, “But they feel demeaned or insulted to be invited to teachers’ programmes to the point that request for financial assistance would be weighed till even Avery, the scales makers of years of yore, would be wondering in his grave if it is the same God that made others who also made teachers. Yet everyone wants the teacher to achieve highflying results. “The young professional teacher may not tolerate such humiliating treatments; and the future may not be better than it is today. And the truth must be told, government‘s negative attitude towards the teacher has largely been responsible for society’s lack of respect for the teacher.” To attract young professionals to teaching profession, the NUT boss asked government to evolve a positive attitude towards the public school teachers for the society to accord them due respect. In the new spirit for education in the state, Ukpong reminded government to clear outstanding arrears of teachers such as the 2013, 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2019 leave grants; promotion arrears of 2011 till date; 7.5 percent contributory pensions refund to teachers in primary and secondary schools and delays in the release of teachers’ promotions, among others.

Police have blocked a march by thousands of people in Pakistani-controlled Kashmir who wanted to move toward the highly militarized Line of Control that divides the territory between Pakistan and India. The marchers are protesting the lockdown in Indian-administered Kashmir, Idaho States Man reports via AP. Police placed shipping containers on the road and deployed a large contingent of officers near Jaskool, 8 kilometers (5 miles) from the frontier to stop the supporters of the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front, which announced it intended to cross the frontier to help Kashmiris under Indian oppression. Abdul Hameed Butt, a leader of the JKLF, said Sunday the protesters would stage a sit-in until the blockade removed. Police officer Arshad Naqvi said protesters won’t be allowed to continue because of the threat of “unprovoked enemy fire.” India imposed a strict curfew on Aug. 5 after stripping Indian-controlled Kashmir of its statehood.

Former Melbourne school principal Malka Leifer, accused of sexually abusing female students at a Jewish school, has been released from custody in Israel as her court matters continue. Leifer appeared before the Jerusalem District Court on Wednesday and was granted bail, Melbourne-based alleged victim Dassi Erlich said. Last month, the Jerusalem District Court ruled that a new psychiatric report is needed to assess if Leifer is fit to face an extradition trial over child sex abuse allegations. That hearing was number 57 as the case to try and bring the former principal of the ultra-Orthodox Adass Israel school in Elsternwick in Melbourneâ€™s south-east back to Australia to face 74 charges of rape and child sex abuse met countless delays.

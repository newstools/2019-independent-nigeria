The Federal Government yesterday offered for sub­scription two-year savings bond at 11.244 per cent and three-year savings bond at 12.244 per cent per annum, the Debt Management Of­fice (DMO) has said. According to the offer cir­cular obtained from the DMO website by DAILY INDEPEN­DENT, the two-year bond will be due in October 2021 while the three-year bond will be due in October 2022. It, however, did not state how much was offered, but added that the maximum subscription was N50 mil­lion at N1,000 per unit, subject to minimum sub­scription of N5,000 and in multiples of N1,000. The website showed that the bond was fully backed by the full faith and credit of the Federal Government, with quar­terly coupon payments to bondholders. The savings bond issuance is expected to help finance the nation’s budget deficit.

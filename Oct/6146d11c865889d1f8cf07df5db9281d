Lagos- Chief Ebenezer Babatope, a former Minister of Transport has warned that disregarding court orders may eventually bring about the downfall of the Muhammadu Buhari-led administration. Speaking in a chat with Daily Independent, on the refusal of the government to release the convener of #Revolutionnow protest, Omoyele Sowore, despite a court order, Babatope, a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said the federal government is making a costly error by flouting judicial pronouncements that are not in its favour. “The truth is that they are making costly errors by not adhering strictly to the implementation and sustenance of the rule of law.” “What they are doing in terms of Sowore’s case is a very tragic departure from what a normal nation-state should be.” “If they are not careful, their determination not to honour court decisions will eventually be their Achilles heel”, he said.

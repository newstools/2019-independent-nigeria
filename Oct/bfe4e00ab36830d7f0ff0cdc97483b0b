Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has shunned Manchester United when talking about teams challenging for the top four. The Spaniard named Liverpool, Tottenham, Arsenal, Chelsea, and Leicester when discussing the current battle in the table, omitting the Red Devils, UK Express reports. Guardiola said when asked to predict the title race: “It’s too early. “There is one team above the others – Liverpool – and then another, us, is close.

Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool opened up an eight-point gap over City with their narrow win over Leicester on Saturday, but former Barcelona boss Guardiola is not feeling too worried at this stage of the season. “It’s not about being concerned,” he said. “They have tough fixtures but we have tough fixtures too. It’s not about them. “I don’t know the Liverpool schedule but I know my schedule quite well. “The next month to a month and a half I know exactly what is ahead. I’m not concerned. “If they are in this run and we don’t win, I will congratulate them. “All we can do is try to maintain our level and play better every game then see what happens. “We are in the first days of October and we finish in May so there are a lot of games and competitions to play, a lot of different situations and good and bad moments to handle.”

Compared to August, the consumer price index, which tracks costs for household goods and services, was flat as energy prices continued their recent decline, falling another 1.4%, including a 2.4% drop in gasoline. powered by Rubicon Project
Over the last 12 months, CPI rose 1.7%, the same as in August, as energy prices are down 4.5%. Even when volatile food and fuel prices are stripped out, core CPI rose just 0.1% for the month, below economists’ expectations. Compared to September of last year, the core measure was up 2.4%, also the same as August – which had been the biggest increase since July 2018 and a level not exceeded in a decade. That measure was held down by a steep 1.6% drop in used car prices, but economists said they are expected to rebound, a repeat of what happened at this time last year. In addition to shelter and medical care, costs for car insurance and household furnishings rose, along with education and air fares.

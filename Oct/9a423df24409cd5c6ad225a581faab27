UYO – Retired Captain Iniobong Ekong, a security expert and Senior Special Assistant to Governor Udom Emmanuel on Security Matters, has advocated for the decentralisation of the nation’s police operations to check the myriads of security challenges facing the country. Ekong who made the advocacy during an interaction with journalists in Uyo, the Akwa Ibom State capital on Thursday, argued that the current structure and formation of the nation’s police was not effective in tackling the spate of insecurity in the country, hence the urgent need for restructuring and decentralisation. “You cannot have one DPO to control and provide security in a local government like Ibiono Ibom with more than 200 villages, and with perhaps one vehicle that’s not functional.

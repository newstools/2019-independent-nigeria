YouTube Music is going to come pre-installed on Android devices, Google has announced. The service – which has struggled to seize a significant portion of the music streaming market – will replace the relatively unsuccessful Google Play Music app, according to Sky News. The move is more a matter of Google consolidating its estate of products rather than attempting to meet the standards of competitors. YouTube Music will come pre-installed on new Android smartphones and will be included in the next version of its operating system, which will simply be known as Android 10 after Google ditched its dessert-themed naming conventions. YouTube has two billion monthly active users, many of whom use it to listen to music, but the company’s dedicated music streaming service only had 15 million subscribers as of May – less than 0.8% of YouTube’s user base. To date, YouTube Music has underperformed compared with rival services in terms of monthly active users, including Spotify with 223 million and Apple Music with 60 million subscribers. Unlike these rival apps, the free version of YouTube Music does not allow those users to listen to the audio of their favourite songs while the app is running in the background.

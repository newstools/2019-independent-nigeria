ABUJA – Security personnel at the National Assembly on Tuesday manhandled two accredited journalists for taking photographs and video clips of scenes around the legislative complex as the Legislature prepared to receive the president. The journalists, Alex Okoro of Lagos Television and Emiene Odaudu of Cool FM Abuja, were harassed while giving situation report via photographs and videos at the main entrance to the National Assembly complex. Recall that the House of Representatives Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila, on Thursday last week, announced that the National Assembly would on Tuesday (yesterday) receive President Muhammadu Buhari to lay the 2020 Budget proposal. This gave rise to security beef up around the National Assembly on Tuesday morning, even as staff were asked to stay away until the process was concluded. But covering the build up to the presentation, police personnel seized the phone and other gadgets the affected journalists were using to carry out their duties at the scene. According to one of the affected journalists, “I was heading to the gate when I saw one of our colleagues being held by a NASS security personnel who was speaking with a staff of Wazobia FM through the phone.

At last, Nigeria made the podium at the just ended 2019 International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) World Championship as Ese Brume finished third in the women Long Jump final with a leap of 6.91 meters. She was beaten to the gold and bronze medals by German Malaika Mihambo and Ukrainian Maryna Bekh-Romanchuk respectively. The Germany, who is the current European champions in Long Jump, jumped a distance of 7.30 metres to beat Bekh-Romanchuk of Ukraine whose distance was 6.92. Meanwhile, Brume’s medal marked the first and only medal won by Nigeria at the global event, even as her compatriot, Tobi Amusan, finished fourth in the women’s 100 metres Hurdle. The United States of American duo, Nia Ali and Kendra Harrison won gold and silver medals at the times of 12.34 seconds and 12.46 seconds respectively, while Danielle Williams of Jamaica took bronze at the time of 12.47 seconds while Amusan ended on a time of 12.49 seconds. However, Amusan had earlier became the first Nigerian athlete in 20 years to qualify for the final of the women’s 100m Hurdles at the World Athletics Championship, and she did it matching her personal best of 12.48 seconds.

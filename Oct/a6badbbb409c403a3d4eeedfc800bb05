Prices of staple food such as rice and other banned items that still find their way into the Nigerian market have steadily been on the high side, as a resulted of the continued closure of surrounding borders by the Federal Government coupled with no definite date of re-opening. The situation has not also been favourable to consumers and traders either as they have continued to lament over the exorbitant price at which they buy  local rice since the implementation of the ban on imported rice by the Nigeria Customs Service. Rice is a staple food in Nigeria, consumed by all and sundry regardless of the social status. But with the current hike in its prices, it seemed not to be so again. Contrary to expectations that the ban would boost local production of rice such that it would be purchased by consumers at an affordable price, the scenario appeared not to be so as the prices of local rice have hit the roofs, currently beyond the reach of many, particularly, the common folks. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Prior to the closure of surrounding borders, prices of local rice were not as high as they are now. In fact, traders were pleading for patronage at a reduced price so as to recoup their money. Consumers, on the other hand, have choices to make as at then, and their penchant for foreign rice saw a larger number of them preferring and going for imported rice. With the continued confiscation of imported rice by the Nigeria Customs, the commodity seemed to be scarce in most of the markets visited. Few traders that had imported rice do not display them for fear of being impounded by the Nigeria Customs and as such sell them at a very high price for consumers that are interested. Findings from a market survey across some states by the Business and Market Intelligence of SUNDAY INDEPENDENT revealed that prices of local rice soared by over 20 percent between August and October 3, 2019. Reasons predominantly mentioned for the rise were scarcity and high demand as imported ones are difficult to come by. During the week, checks at the Ogbeogologo Market, Asaba, showed that prices of local rice have skyrocketed the more. For instance, a 50kg bag of local rice earlier sold for between N14,800 and N15,000 went up, currently ranging from N18,000 to N18,500 depending on the haggling power of the buyer. That of imported rice sighted at the said market grew to N23,000 from N17,000 formerly sold, signifying a 35 percent rise. Many of the traders at the Ogbeogologo Market, Asaba, told our correspondent that unavailability was responsible for the hike. The same could be said for that of Ose Market, Onitsha, especially with the current prices of a 50kg bag of local rice going for between N17,500 and N18,000 as against N14,500 initially attracted. Few traders that still had imported rice in stock sold a 50kg bag of it for between N22,500 and N23,000 up from 16,500 sold before. For Wuse Market, Abuja, prices of local rice increased further to between N16,500 and N17,500 from N14,500 previously sold. But this depends on the quality and the bargaining power of the buyer. Mr. Ebuka Precious, who trades in all kinds of grains at the Wuse Market, Abuja, blamed the exorbitant price on the closure of all borders by the Federal Government without making adequate provisions or alternatives for the citizenry. That of Achau Market was also high, currently selling for N17,000 from N14,000 formerly sold. At the Itam Market, Uyo, prices of both imported and local rice are currently at an upward trend especially when compared with what they were initially sold. Prices of the commodity escalated by over 20 percent as prices of a 50kg bag of local rice, sold earlier for N15,000 rose to between  N18,000 and N18,500  while that of imported rice increased considerably  by over 30 percent to N23,000 from N17,000 sold before. Mrs. Beatrice Umanah, who trades in all kinds of grains at the Itam Market Uyo, attributed the situation to inadequate supply arising from scarcity. For that of Lafenwa Market, Ogun State, prices of the commodity were at a rising trend. For instance, a 50kg bag of local rice that was earlier sold for N15,000 increased to  between N17,500 and N18,000  in the week under review. That of imported rice also soared, attracting between N22,000 and N23,000 up from N15,500 previously sold. Most of the traders, however, linked the steady rise in the prices of both commodities to scarcity and increased patronage owing to border closure. Checks at the Bodija Market, Ibadan, also indicated that situation was not different in terms of price variations. Most of the shops visited were hoarding imported rice for fear of being impounded by the Nigeria Customs and as such did not display them unless if requested for. That of the local rice was well flaunted and sold at an unfavorable price particularly when compared with their previous prices. For example, prices of a 50kg bag of local rice formerly sold for between N13,500 and N14,000 soared to N19,000 while that of imported rice went for between N23,000 and N24,000 up from N15,000 previously sold. A man who simply identified himself as Abbey but trades in the commodity at the Bodija Market, Ibadan, in a chat with SUNDAY INDEPENDENT attributed the hike to unavailability, stressing that the local produce rice cannot service the entire nation, hence, the increase in prices to avoid bulk buying. For Lagos, the trend was not different as visits to popular markets such as Daleko, Mile 12 and Iddo revealed that prices of the commodity had escalated further. For instance, a 50kg bag of local rice initially sold for between N13,500 and N14,000 rose to N18,500 while that of imported rice, although  not conspicuously displayed went for N24,000 against N13, 500 previously sold. But other retail markets sell higher than what is obtainable at the aforementioned markets. For example, a 50kg bag of local rice currently sells for between N19,500 and N20,000  while the imported rice soared to between N25,000 and N27,000 in markets such as Oshodi, Ikorodu and Ogba. The situation saw some of the consumers interviewed, pleading with the Federal Government to subsidize the price of local rice to alleviate the sufferings of the masses. They also appealed to government at all levels to encourage and empower more farmers to engage in rice production to create room for availability, which eventually will certainly bring down the prices.

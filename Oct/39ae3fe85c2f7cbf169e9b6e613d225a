LAGOS – Godwin Izilein, former Super Falcons coach has decried the poor management of Nigerian League on the premise that it is losing relevance. Izilein in an exclusive chat with DAILY INDEPENDENT on Monday, while dwelling on the poor performance of Home Eagles in the on-going West Africa Union Football (WAFU) championship in Senegal, said that the Nigerian league is being managed by “interlopers.” According to him, the fortune of the Nigerian clubs could only improve if technocrats are allowed to take charge. “For examples, the man heading the Nigerian Professional Football League (NPFL), Shehu Dikko, is an architect; he learnt on the job – sheer administrative experience he gained for being there over time, but he is not a technocrat. For such a person, there is a huge gap between him and someone as Segun Odegbami, being in charge. “People in the likes of Odegbami are technocrats; they have the training, they played the game and are still in the game. Such technocrats cannot be pushed around, because they know the rudiments of the game – they are professional. Sadly, such persons will never be allowed to be there,” he said. Three Nigerian clubs in the continental campaigns – Enyimba of Aba; Kano Pillars CAF Champions League) and Niger Tornadoes (CAF Confederations Cup) have been thrown out in the preliminary rounds with only Rangers International of Enugu remaining in the Confederations Cup – which justifies Izilein’s apprehension. Izilein concluded by saying, “Most of our administrators are masquerades who were dressed by others; if you don’t have anybody to dress you, you are in trouble; but if you attempt to dress yourself, it becomes an abomination.”

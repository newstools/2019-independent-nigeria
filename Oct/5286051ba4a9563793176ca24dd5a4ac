Mundo Deportivo takes a look at the players who have played for Barca’s opponents and also the Nerazzurri players who were transferred targets for the La Liga winners. One of the players who were on the radar of the Catalan club was Lautaro Martínez, who moved to San Siro from the Argentine side Racing Club in 2018, according to Sport Witness. The 22-year-old managed nine goals and two assists in all competitions from his debut season in Italy. According to Argentine Radio La Red – as relayed by Mundo – Ernesto Valverde’s side were interested in acquiring his services in the summer. Radio La Red further goes on to suggest the Spanish champions were willing to offer €112m to sign Martínez. It’s claimed the figure is ‘totally disproportionate’ given that Inter paid €23m to Racing Club last year. Barcelona’s idea was to partner the Inter player with his international teammate Lionel Messi at the Camp Nou. It has not worked out and Martínez could be in contention to start against the Blaugrana later today.

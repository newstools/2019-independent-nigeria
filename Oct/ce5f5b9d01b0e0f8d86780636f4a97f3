United have a woeful record since Solskjaer was appointed manager on a permanent basis in March and have made their worst start to a season in 30 years. They have suffered defeats to West Ham, Crystal Palace and Newcastle this term and are sitting 12th in the table having won only two of their opening eight Premier League games, Talksport reports via The Sun. Former England boss Sam Allardyce has claimed United are so poor under Solskjaer they may even be dragged into a relegation battle. United’s executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward gave Solskjaer his backing last month, insisting they were adopting a long-term approach having gone through four managers in six years. “It’s important that we are patient while Ole and his team build for the future,” Woodward said. “We will continue to focus on the long-term strategy and won’t be influenced by short-term distractions.” The club are preparing to ditch Solskjaer if he loses to Norwich at the end of the month. The Norwegian could even go before then, should United lose heavily to bitter rivals Liverpool at Old Trafford. The Sun, though, say the Norwich game is the ‘acid test’ and the one that looks set to ultimately decide his fate. With Solskjaer’s position under scrutiny, a number of names are being talked about as potential contenders to replace him in the United hotseat. One such name is Julian Nagelsmann – RB Leipzig’s highly-rated young boss. Nagelsmann became the youngest manager in Bundesliga history when he took charge at Hoffenheim aged just 28. He turned them from a relegation-threatened team to Champions League qualifiers before leaving in the summer to take over Leipzig, where he continues to impress. According to the Mail, United have Nagelsmann in their sights should they decide to bring an end to Solskjaer’s reign.

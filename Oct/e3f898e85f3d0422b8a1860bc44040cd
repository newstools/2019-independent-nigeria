The Federal Government has given approval to the Cross River State Government to commence the development of Bakassi Agro Deep Seaport. A statement from the Ministry of Transportation yesterday said the Cross River State Governor, Ben Ayade, made this known at a courtesy call on the Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi in Abuja. On the issue of how the state will get money to complete such a gigantic project, the governor said they have entered into partnership with investors who are willing and ready to make the project possible and easy in the next two to three years. He commended the President and the Minister of Transportation for their foresight, for being detribalised and for recognising that the project transcends politics, and so fast tracked the approval for the project, not minding that Cross River is PDP state.

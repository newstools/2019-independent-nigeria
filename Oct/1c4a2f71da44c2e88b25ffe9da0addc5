Kanu, who spoke to footballlive.com, noted that Nigerian fans want to see the Gernot Rohr’s squad give the Brazilians a good run for their money. “There is a lot of pressure because everybody loves football, they don’t want to hear that Nigeria went to a game and lost. “I don’t think people will really appreciate the boys if they lost in a friendly game, that’s how it is here. The boys have to take it on board and ensure that every game they play, they have to do well.”

Man Utd have reached a verbal agreement to sign a veteran Serie A frontman, while Pep Guardiola has named the one player Man City will never sell, according to Thursday’s papers. Manchester United have reportedly reached a verbal agreement to sign Juventus striker Mario Mandzukic in the new year. Mandzukic was close to joining the Red Devils over the summer only to remain in Turin, where he hasn’t featured for Maurizio Sarri’s men this season and was also omitted from their 25-man Champions League squad.

Tuttosport claims that Mandzukic’s camp have an agreement in place with United, who he will join on January 1. Mandukic has scored 44 goals in 162 games for Juve since joining the club from Atletico Madrid in 2015. He will add some much-needed firepower to a United side that has struggled so far this season, having also allowed Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez to join Inter Milan while first-choice No.9 Anthony Martial has been out for weeks through injury.

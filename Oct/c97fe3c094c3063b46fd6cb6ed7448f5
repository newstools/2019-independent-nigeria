Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Lacazette has two goals in three games so far this season and in his absence the north London club have won twice and drawn three times in the league, while beating Frankfurt and Standard Liege in the Europa League. Former Arsenal co-owner David Dein says the club should be aiming for the top two under head coach Unai Emery.
The 28-year-old’s return would mean manager Unai Emery has a full squad to choose from against the newly-promoted Blades in just over a week’s time. The Frenchman has scored 38 goals for Arsenal in total since signing a £46.5m deal from Lyon in 2017 would re-establish the club’s intended forward line of Lacazette, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and newcomer Nicolas Pepe. Emile Smith-Rowe is the only other Gunner currently out with a knock following a collision against a Nottingham Forest player in the Carabao Cup in late September.

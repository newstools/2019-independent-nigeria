AKURE – A socio-cultural group from Ondo State, Egbe Omo Ilaje, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to reverse the appointment of the Managing Director of Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) from Delta State to Ondo State. Addressing newsmen at the NUJ Press Centre, Akure, the Ondo State capital, on Monday, National Secretary of the group, Rev. Edamisan Ogunfeyijimi, noted that it was the turn of Ondo State to occupy the position of the managing director of the commission. Quoting from the Act that established the commission, Ogunfeyijimi stated that “NDDC Act, CAP N86 Laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and commencing from July 12, 2000 Section 12 reads that “There shall be for the commission a Managing Director and two executive directors who shall be indigenes of oil producing areas starting with the member-states of the commission with the highest production quantum of oil and shall rotate among member-states in order of production.” The group alleged that the NDDC Act has been breached severally, “particularly in the position of the managing director, which has been held exclusively by the four member states of Akwa Ibom, Rivers, Delta and Bayelsa, contrary to the Act.” The group, however, called on President Buhari to review the appointments, saying “We enjoin President Muhammadu Buhari to personally review the announced appointments and ensure full compliance with the provisions of the NDDC Act. “In particular, we demand that the position of the Managing Director of the commission be given to Ondo State oil producing areas as of legal and legitimate right.”

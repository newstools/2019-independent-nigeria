Marmite maker Unilever has announced plans to halve the amount of virgin plastic it uses by 2025 as part of a major sustainability push. The consumer giant, which also owns household brands such as Ben & Jerry’s and Dove, said it will cut more than 100,000 tonnes of plastic packaging out of its supply chain through new commitments to reduce waste, Belfast Telegraph reports. The sustainability drive is one of the first key moves by chief executive Alan Jope, who has continued to sharpen the firm’s green credentials, set by previous boss Paul Polman. Plastic has its place, but that place is not in the environment. We can only eliminate plastic waste by acting fast and taking radical action at all points in the plastic cycleAlan Jope, Unilever chief executive Unilever has promised that by 2025 it will halve the amount of virgin plastic – plastic that has not previously been used or processed – by reducing its total use of plastic packaging by more than 100,000 tonnes and accelerating its use of recycled plastic. It said that by 2025 it will also help collect and process more plastic packaging than it sells in an attempt to partly offset the environmental impact of the business. Unilever’s commitment will require it to help collect and process around 600,000 tonnes of plastic annually.

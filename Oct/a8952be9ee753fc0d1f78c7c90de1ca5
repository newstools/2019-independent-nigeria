UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is to send what he called a “constructive and reasonable” proposal for Britain to exit the EU on Wednesday. In a speech to his Conservative party, he said he wanted to find an alternative to the Irish “backstop”, but maintained there would be no checks at the border. Johnson warned that Britons would lose trust in democracy if Brexit does not happen by the 31 October deadline. Voters narrowly chose to leave the EU in a 2016 referendum, but the country remains deeply divided over the departure terms. “After three and a half years, people are beginning to feel that they are being taken for fools,” Johnson told Conservative party members in Manchester. “They are beginning to suspect that there are forces in this country that simply don’t want Brexit delivered at all. And if they turn out to be right in that suspicion, then I believe there will be grave consequences for trust in our democracy.”

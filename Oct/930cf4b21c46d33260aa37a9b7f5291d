Lagos- Some elder statesmen in the country on Wednesday denied fighting for Vice-President, Yemi Osinbajo, when they demanded an explanation from the presidency on his current travails. The leaders which include; Chief Edwin Clark (South South); Chief Ayo Adebanjo (South West); Chief John Nwodo (South East) and Dr. Pogu Bitrus (Middle Belt), who spoke under the aegis of The Southern and Middle Belt Leaders Forum (SMBLF), had demanded that the Federal Government brief Nigerians on the reasons for stripping the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo of some of his statutory responsibilities. The forum said it was following with keen interest, developments in the presidency in the past few days. However, when asked why they are taking up Osinbajo’s fight, especially given his opposition to their views on restructuring, Yinka Odumakin, one of the leaders of the forum said they are only defending constitutional democracy. “We are not fighting for Osinbajo as a person. We are only defending the principle of constitutional democracy by asking to be briefed on the reasons for his ordeal”. “We have also asked that the allegations against him should be investigated. That is not the concept of fighting for somebody” he said

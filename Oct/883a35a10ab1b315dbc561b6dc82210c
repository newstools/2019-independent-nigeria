Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The leader, who said there is no tribe like Yoruba, urged various groups and individuals in the region to come together to mobilise for the good of the people. He harped on the need to use agriculture to address youth unemployment, saying it is when the youths have jobs that the issue of security could be achieved. “We will mount powerful operations and campaigns to revive our agriculture and our industrial development that has been deliberately stopped in Nigeria. We have arisen to energise our people to grow an economy that will provide gainful employment for all our men, women and youths. “We are embarking on a call to our youths to stop living in the world of hopelessness and begin to take the advantage of their education to crave opportunities for themselves in the growing economy of our nation,” he said. He disclosed that a project called ONALA, which is a fighting force for the rejuvenation of Yoruba spirit, is in place. “ONALA is a fighting force for the rejuvenation of Yoruba culture, integrity, moral power, language and spirit of enterprise. It is a fighting force for the revival of Yoruba confidence. As a tool for all its activities and programmes, ONALA will engage in serious researches, fund research projects and encourage and support researchers working in any field of Yoruba culture and Yoruba enterprise,” he said.

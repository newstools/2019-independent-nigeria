Two suspected missiles struck an Iranian tanker travelling through the Red Sea, causing the oil to leak, the National Iranian Tanker Company that owns the ship said Friday, according to Aawsat.com reports. It said the hull of the SABITY suffered two separate explosions, adding they were “probably caused by missile strikes.” “All the ship’s crew are safe and the ship is stable too,” said NITC, stating those on board were trying to repair the damage. The state-owned company said that contrary to reports, “there is no fire aboard the vessel and the ship is completely stable”. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network

Cristiano Ronaldo achieved yet another remarkable landmark on Tuesday night after notching a record-equalling Champions League strike in the routine win over Bayer Leverkusen. The Portuguese superstar added the third for Juventus as the Italians cruised to a 3-0 triumph over their German rivals to go top of Champions League Group D on a rainy night in Turin, The Daily Mirror reports. And Ronaldo’s latest European strike, his 127th in the Champions League, saw him score against a different opponent for the 33rd time, equalling the record set by Real Madrid icon Raul. The former Manchester United and Madrid hero will not want to rest on his laurels, though, as arch-rival and Barcelona star Lionel Messi has scored against 32 different teams in the Champions League. Tuesday night’s triumph was a morale-boosting European victory for Juventus and Ronaldo, who is the competition’s all-time top goalscorer with 127 goals. Juventus, who threw away a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 away to Atletico Madrid on opening day, paired Gonzalo Higuain with Ronaldo in attack and it did not take long for the move to pay off. Keeper Hradecky nearly conceded a third in the 70th minute, taking a bad touch on a back pass that almost steered the ball into his own goal and then trying to get out of trouble with a risky short pass before the danger was cleared. Leverkusen’s best chance of the night fell to substitute Paulinho, but the 19-year-old Brazilian could not crown his Champions League debut with a goal and his lob went wide. Portuguese attacker Ronaldo had a frustrating night in attack but after uncharacteristically missing some decent second-half chances, he slotted the ball through Hradecky’s legs to make it 3-0 in the 88th minute. The win puts Juventus top of the group on four points and ahead of second-placed Atletico Madrid, who won 2-0 away to third-placed Lokomotiv Moscow, on goal difference. Leverkusen is bottom after their second straight defeat.

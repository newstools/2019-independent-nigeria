Lyon have failed with an ambitious approach to hire Jose Mourinho as their new manager, with the Portuguese coach desperate to secure an imminent return to the Premier League. The former Manchester United and Chelsea boss is waiting for the right opportunity to return to club management after being sacked as Red Devils boss in December last year. And RMC has reported that Lyon President Jean-Michel Aulas contacted Mourinho about the vacant managerial role following the sacking of Sylvinho. However Mourinho made it clear that his focus is on returning to management in England, where his family currently live, and Lyon will now turn their attention to former France and Paris Saint-Germain manager Laurent Blanc. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network It is understood that Mourinho is reportedly eyeing the Tottenham manager’s job as speculation continues over the future of Mauricio Pochettino. The Daily Mail claims Mourinho is open to the idea of managing the north London club should Pochettino leave.

Tottenham, of course, were Champions League finalists last season, and started the season among the favourites to yet again secure a top-four spot – although recent results in both the Premier League and in Europe’s elite competition have somewhat undermined their challenge for honours. Saturday’s shock 3-0 defeat away to Brighton followed last Tuesday’s 7-2 thrashing at home to Bayern Munich in the Champions League, increasing the pressure on Pochettino. And, never one to sell himself short, Mourinho has said he is waiting for a club “the same level” that he is as a manager. He said: “I have to be patient and wait for the right opportunity and the right opportunity is one that is at the same size and the same level that I am as a manager. I have to wait for the exact right one.”

ASABA – A polytechnic graduate identified as Chinedu Igboke was reportedly swept away by a ravaging flood in Asaba, Delta State capital, on Monday evening. The victim, 30, who hails from Ebonyi State, before the incident was working as a guard in a private school along Shekinah Love Assembly Street, Off Ralph Uwechue Way, Okpanam Road, Asaba. DAILY INDEPENDENT gathered that the floods were caused by the torrential rains in the capital city for some hours on the day of the incident. A witness confirmed to our reporter during a visit to the scene on Tuesday, that the deceased was controlling traffic which built up on Shekinah Love Assembly Street following the gridlock along Okpanam road, when he missed his steps and fell into the uncovered gutter along the road. The spot where he was reported to have fallen into was overgrown with weeds unknown to him that portion of the road is a gutter and making it impossible for his rescue. Another witness explained that the gutter was flooded when Igboke fell into it, adding that before help could come, he was already swept into the deep tunnel which is channeled to Anwai River. The witness said, “When he fell into the gutter he slammed his head against the concrete walls of the gutter. So he may have lost the strength and was unable to rescue himself and he was swept into the tunnel.” the source said. It was gathered that the school authority where Igboke worked as a guard had mobilised swimmers for his rescue but to no avail. “We suspect that the body maybe hanging somewhere in the tunnel but the body could not pass through because of the blockage. We went with them to the river but they could not recover his body.” the source added.

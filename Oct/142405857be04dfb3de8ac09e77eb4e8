AKURE – Indigenes of Ondo State, who were among Nigerians who hurriedly returned home on the wake of xenophobic attacks in South Africa, have been presented with a cash gift of N100,000 each by Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu. The cash gift is part of the measures being put in place by the state government to re-settle the returnees with a view to cushioning the effect of their premature return. Presenting the cash gift in his office at Alagbaka, Akure, the state capital while receiving the South African returnees, the governor promised to give necessary support and provide an enabling environment for them to start a new life. The governor, who was represented by his Deputy, Hon. Agboola Ajayi, condemned the xenophobic attacks on Nigerians and other foreign nationals living in South Africa, describing it as barbaric and condemnable. He, however, admonished the returnees not to be discouraged by what had happened to them but braze up to start a new life as they returned home. Akeredolu assured them that his administration would assist them in settling down in their various communities and ameliorate their present conditions. He, therefore, informed them that they could key into any of the programmes of his administration including youths and women empowerment, agricultural and entrepreneurship programmes. The governor advised them not to be hostile with any foreigners around them so that African countries could remain homes for all. However, Governor Akeredolu appreciated the philanthropic efforts of the management of Air Peace airline by conveying the returnees to the country free of charge.

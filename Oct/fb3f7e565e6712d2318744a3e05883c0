Arsenal will be looking to continue their fine Europa League record at the Emirates Stadium as they take on Belgian side Standard Liège. The Gunners overcame, arguably, what will be their toughest task of the group stage, beating Eintracht Frankfurt 3-0 in Germany, a game that was much tighter than the score-line suggests. Arsenal’s ‘success’ in this competition last season, where they reached the final, had a lot to do with their home form. First-leg deficits against BATE and Rennes were comfortably overturned at the Emirates, whilst home performances against Napoli and Valencia meant neither side stood a chance in the return fixture. Their last defeat at home in this competition came against Graham Potter’s Östersund in February 2018, so Standard Liège know any positive result for them will be an upset. The Belgian side, on their own, impressed against Vitoria SC in their first group game and they’ve also started the domestic season brightly, sitting just a point off the top. Unai Emery may include Hector Bellerin, Kieran Tierney and Rob Holding on Thursday, as all three look to build up fitness after not featuring at Old Trafford on Monday night. The Spaniard may also give another start to summer signing Nicolas Pepe. The Ivorian looks shot of confidence in the final third and a home Europa League fixture would give the ex-Lille man a good opportunity to impress. Alexandre Lacazette remains out with an ankle injury, but we could see him return later this month.

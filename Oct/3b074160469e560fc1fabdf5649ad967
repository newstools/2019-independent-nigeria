OWERRI – Imo State government has indicated its intention to partner with the Sam Okwaraji Foundation to honour the late soccer wizard, Samuel Okwaraji, as part of events lined up for his 30 years memorial anniversary. Mr Fan Ndubuoke, Chairman Imo State Sports Commission, disclosed this Monday, when members of Samuel Okwaraji Foundation paid him a courtesy visit to solicit the endorsement of Imo government to honour the late renowned footballer. Our correspondent recalls that Okwaraji, ex-Super Eagle midfielder until his death at 25, was a masters degree holder in international law and slumped and died on August 12 1989 during a World Cup qualifier against Angola at the National Stadium, Lagos. Speaking on behalf of the Imo government, Ndubuoke said the memorial event became necessary following Okwaraji’s patriotism. “I am glad to tell you of Imo government willingness to partner and support you in this very important event. “Late Samuel Okwaraji was a patriot and one of the Imo sons that made the state proud both at the national and international level,” he said. He said he was aware of the promises, which the Federal Government made to honour the late footballer. “I was a sports journalist with Champion Newspapers in 1989 when Okwaraji died. “Now that I am in a position to play a role in honouring the late Eagles super star, I will do my best to ensuring that the programme is successful”, he said.

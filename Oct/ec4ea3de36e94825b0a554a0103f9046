An American lady identified as @erika_flow354, recently shared her experience with a Nigerian man, with members of the internet community.
@erika_flow354 explained that the individual had asked her out on a date, and she deliberately cancelled. However, to her utter surprise, instead of him to get upset, he replied her message by saying: “Say less.” As if that was not enough, the lady explained further that within a week of turning him down, the guy got a new girl, built his home and started a new business, all without getting in touch with her anymore. In a different tweet, the lady explained that the experience was humbling. She said a lot of women have gotten used to taking guys for granted because of the amount of attention they get.

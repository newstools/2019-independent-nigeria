LAGOS – Ese Brume, the only Nigerian athlete that won a medal (bronze) at the just concluded World Championships in Doha, Qatar has lamented poor welfare of athletes in the country. Nigeria reached the finals of three events in Doha and they are 100m Hurdles, Mens shot put and women’s long jump where Brume featured. Brume, who spoke against the backdrop of the country’s poor performance at the championships, called on the government to be alive to its responsibilities by ensuring that athletes were taken care off. “They (Government and the Athletics Federation Of Nigeria) should improve the welfare of athletes; they should provide some support for us, because they are not helping us at all; it is God that brought us this far (in Doha). We need help,” she said. Brume leaped 6.91m in her second attempt and was beaten by an inch to miss out on Silver to Ukraine’s Maryna Bekh-Romanchuk (6.92). World number one and Germany’s Malaika Mihambo claimed gold in Doha ahead of the pack with a World leading 7.30 jump.

Not long ago, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, was hailed across the United States as a long-awaited agent of change who was opening up his conservative kingdom by ushering in an era of social and economic reforms. Tech giants gave him personal tours in Silicon Valley, Hollywood producers considered Saudi projects, and President Trump praised the prince as an indispensable ally in fighting terrorism and blunting Iran’s influence in the region. Then, Saudi agents killed and dismembered the dissident Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul one year ago on Wednesday — dealing a potentially crippling blow to Prince Mohammed’s international image, upending his charm offensive and prompting some international businesses to shun the kingdom. Now, after recent drone and missile attacks halved the kingdom’s oil production and cut 5 percent of the world’s oil supply, and at a time when the willingness of the United States to intervene on Saudi Arabia’s behalf is in doubt, Prince Mohammed, 34, the kingdom’s de facto ruler, needs allies. But the shadow of Mr. Khashoggi’s killing continues to stalk him.

Crude oil production by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC, tumbled the most in 16 years last month after an attack on Saudi Arabia’s energy facilities which temporarily halved output in the world’s biggest crude exporter. Supplies from the Organisation’s 14 members plunged by 1.59 million barrels a day to 28.32 million a day, according to a Bloomberg survey of officials, ship-tracking data and estimates from consultants including Rystad Energy AS, JBC Energy GmbH and Energy Aspects Ltd. The data shows it was the biggest monthly drop since labor strikes briefly paralyzed Venezuela’s oil industry in 2002. Saudi Aramco has made surprisingly swift progress in repairing the damaged infrastructure, and says it’s now fully attained pre-attack levels. Oil prices, having surged the most on record immediately after the attack, have relinquished the gains to trade close to $60 a barrel again in London. The kingdom restored output to 9.9 million barrels a day as of September 25 and is now pumping slightly more than that, according to Ibrahim Al-Buainain, chief executive of Aramco’s trading unit. The survey further indicated that Saudi production on average last month was the lowest since 2010. Production for the OPEC, as a whole was the lowest since 2009, when it was slashing output amid the financial crisis, though its membership has changed since then. The organisation is made up of 14 oil producers from the Middle East, Africa and Latin America who collectively pump about a third of the world’s crude, and periodically raise or cut production to keep markets in equilibrium and defend oil prices.

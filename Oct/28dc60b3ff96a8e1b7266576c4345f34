Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Police say the shooting was drug-related and not connected to the case. US marshals took Michael, 32, into custody at a motel in Marksville, Louisiana, on Tuesday, Dallas police said. Jacquerious, 20, had been arrested earlier at a hospital in Louisiana. A manhunt for Mr Green is still going on. The three men face murder charges. According to police, the Mitchells and Mr Green, 22, had driven to Dallas, Texas, from Alexandria, Louisiana, to allegedly purchase marijuana from Mr Brown. During the alleged drug deal on Saturday, Mr Green and Mr Brown had an argument which led to a physical fight and the shooting. Mr Brown allegedly shot and wounded the younger Mr Mitchell first, before Mr Green shot Mr Brown twice, Jacquerious Mitchell told police. Authorities said Mr Green then took Mr Brown’s gun and backpack and the men fled. Michael Mitchell is suspected of being the getaway driver. They left the wounded Jacquerious at the hospital where he was later arrested. When police arrived on scene shortly after 22:30 (03:30 GMT), witnesses directed them to a parking lot where Mr Brown was lying on the ground with multiple gunshot wounds. Mr Brown later died in hospital. The incident occurred in an apartment block different from the one where Botham Jean was killed in September 2018.

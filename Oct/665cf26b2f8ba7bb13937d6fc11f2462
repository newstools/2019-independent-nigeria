Paul Pogba is not in Manchester United’s squad to face AZ Alkmaar in the Europa League because he requires further treatment on the ankle injury he sustained against Southampton in August. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has selected a 21-man squad for the trip to the Netherlands, with Angel Gomes and Diogo Dalot returning after injury, Manchester Evening reports. Pogba damaged his ankle during the 1-1 draw at St Mary’s in United’s fourth Premier League game of the season and missed France’s Euro 2020 qualifiers against Albania and Andorra as well as subsequent United fixtures against Leicester and West Ham. However, he returned to the starting XI against Rochdale last week before also playing the full 90 minutes of United’s draw with Arsenal on Monday night. It is not clear whether Pogba’s injury will rule him out of Sunday’s trip to Newcastle in the Premier League and the club said an update on the Frenchman’s state will be provided in due course. A bout of tonsillitis keeps Aaron Wan-Bissaka sidelined, while Anthony Martial, Luke Shaw, Ashley Young, and Phil Jones haven’t travelled to the Hague either. Shaw returned to training last week after a hamstring problem, while Solskjaer said after the draw with Arsenal that Martial could return against Newcastle. Jones will not be available until after the international break.

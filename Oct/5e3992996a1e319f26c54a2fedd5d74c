Lagos – Towards ensuring sustainable solutions to minimise waste generation, while maximising opportunities for re-use, recycling and regeneration of resources, Ampak Nigeria Limited recently embarked on clean up exercise in some parts of Lagos to mark the World Clean Up Day. The cleanup exercise was done in partnership with the Lagos State Waste Management Authority (LAWMA), who engaged in a sensitisation on the importance of imbibing good environmental management practices and subsequently cleaning up Otunba Jobi Fele Way in Alausa, Ikeja. Mrs. Kemi Ajakaiye, the Executive Director of Ampak Nigeria Limited, while speaking to volunteers and participants during the exercise, stressed that waste collection and disposal is just one fraction of the enormous yet crucial responsibility of managing the environment. Ajakaiye noted that the target of waste management should be to ensure resource efficiency through the application of sustainable solutions that minimise waste generation, while maximizing opportunities for reuse, recycling and regeneration of resources. “The World Cleanup Day (WCD) originated from Estonia, where 50,000 individuals united in purpose and mission to clean the entire country in just five hours. “The success of their story led to the founding of the Let’s Do It Foundation which was modeled after the same inspiration, to clean up an entire country in one day. “This initiative has now transformed into a global movement, with the first internationally observed World Clean Up Day held in September 15, 2018. The global event attracted and united about 18 million volunteers from 157 countries. The overarching objective of this movement remains to steer collaboration among individuals, organisations, and institutions towards positive change in solving waste generation problems”, she said.

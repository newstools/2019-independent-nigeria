In the lobby of a Beirut bank, three customers stuff wads of $100 bills into plastic bags. Each note has its serial number recorded on a receipt, as local law requires. One man’s receipt was so long it trailed on the ground as he left the branch. Surreal as it seems, this scene would be common—if banks had dollars to spare. Over the past few weeks customers have queued for hours only to learn that they cannot access their money. One was told that his branch had less than $2,000 in the vault. Long an immutable fixture of life, the dollar has become an obsession. Lebanon’s currency, the pound, has been pegged at 1,500 to the dollar since 1997. Receipts are printed in both currencies; shopkeepers make change with a mix of dollars and pounds. Officially nothing has changed. But the panic points to a different reality. Protests in Beirut on September 29th heightened the sense of crisis.

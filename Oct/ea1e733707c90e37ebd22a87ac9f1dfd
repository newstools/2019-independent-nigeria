The National Human Rights Commission has strongly condemned the prevalence of Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (SGBV) in the country, especially the rampant allegations of sex for marks being perpetrated by lecturers in institutions of higher learning. Reacting to the media report making the rounds on the alleged case of “sex-for-mark by two lecturers of the University of Lagos, the Executive Secretary of the Commission, Tony Ojukwu said until stringent measures are taken and perpetrators of these heinous acts are adequately prosecuted, the menace may continue to linger”. Describing the menace as an endemic scourge that must urgently deal with as a matter of urgent national concern, Ojukwu observed that the Commission has been inundated with complaints of sexual and gender-based violence in recent times. He said as part of measures to curb this crime against humanity, the Commission is set to hold a public hearing on the matter, saying “We will also seriously monitor the prosecution of the case involving the UNILAG lecturers to the letters.

Speaking further, Ojukwu said due to the nature of complaints on the prevalence of SGBV in institutions of higher learning, “the Commission is planning on establishing a human right desk to deal with general issues of human rights violations, especially as it relates to that of SGBV in our tertiary institutions, the desk will collaborate with the Commission to promptly report all cases of sexual and gender-based violence in tertiary institutions,” he stressed. While urging members of the public, especially family members to desist from interfering with the process of investigation and prosecution of SGBV cases by way of withdrawing the matter during investigations, the Executive Secretary emphasized that victims’ protection mechanism has been put in place by the Commission. He called on the Inspector General of Police (IGP), the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and other relevant authorities to ensure speedy prosecution of various cases of sexual assaults that have been reported in the past.

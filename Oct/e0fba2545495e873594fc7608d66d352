A male tennis umpire has been suspended after being caught making inappropriate remarks to a young ball girl. Chair umpire Gianluca Moscarella made the “indecent” comments during an ATP Challenger Tour match in Florence last week. Footage of the incident has been circulating on social media, where Moscarella can be clearly heard chatting to the young girl. The Italian official is heard referring to the school student as “very sexy” before asking “are you hot… physically or emotionally?”

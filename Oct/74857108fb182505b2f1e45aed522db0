Osogbo – Osun State Agency for the Control of AIDS, in collaboration with Save One Million Lives Programme, has commenced payment of token to pregnant women for attending HIV test. The gesture was designed to save lives of unborn child and prevent infant from infection of HIV/AIDS during pregnancy. The beneficiaries are those that registered at Primary Health Centre and tested for HIV across the 30 local governments in the state. Management and staff of the agency have started visiting all the local governments to know the number of pregnant women that registered and tested for HIV. The agency had earlier organised a three-day training for officers of Local Government Control of AIDS (LACA) to “Scale-up Intervention for Antenatal Clinic Attendance and HIV Counselling and Testing using Community intervention”. To qualify for the money, pregnant woman must register at any government Primary Health Centre for antenatal and test for HIV. The Executive Secretary, O-SACA, Dr. Monsur Bello, commended the turnout of pregnant women across the 30 local governments in the state. He, therefore, enjoined the pregnant women who are yet to register for ante-natal, to register and get test for HIV to prevent unborn babies from infection of HIV/AIDS through their mother.

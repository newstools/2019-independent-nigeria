Attahiru Bafarawa, former governor of Sokoto State, has said the crisis in the All Progressives Congress, APC, was due to the plan by its National Leader, Bola Tinubu, to fully control the party. Speaking with Guardian, the former governor also insisted that the “insincerity” of Tinubu and other APC leaders was responsible for the crisis in the party. He claimed that shortly after the APC was registered, “Tinubu decided on admitting erstwhile state governors elected on the platform of the PDP with the provision that the entire structure of the new party in their respective states should be handed over to the newcomers.” The former presidential aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, said while the decision to reward the five defecting PDP governors from Adamawa, Kano, Kwara, Rivers, and Sokoto with APC structures in their states was taken to strengthen the party’s financial capacity to match the then ruling political grouping, “It later became obvious that the ploy was targeted at himself (Tinubu) and Mallam Ibrahim Shekarau.” He called on politicians and leaders to strive all time to do good to all men. Bafarawa alleged that the internal movement within the APC “could be a way of rewarding Tinubu for his style of politics. “Those who noticed that he (Tinubu) was cleverly manipulating the party for his own interest seem to be moving against him.”

Former Governor of Abia State and Chief Whip of the Senate, Dr. Orji Kalu, has urged policy-makers to make the welfare of Nigerians a top priority in the policy thrust of the government. Acknowledging the contributions of heroes and heroines of Nigeria’s liberation including Sir Tafawa Balewa, Dr. Nnamdi Azikwe, Sir Ahmadu Bello, Chief Anthony Enahoro, Mrs. Funmilayo Ransome- Kuti, Chief Herbert Macaulay and Chief Obafemi Awolowo (all of blessed memory) to the social, economic and political development of Nigeria, the former governor charged Nigerians to support government all levels for the sake of national wellbeing. Kalu, who stressed that the cultural, religious and ethnic diversity of Nigeria should be seen as an asset for nation-building, pointed out that the unity of Nigeria is not negotiable. In a statement issued on Monday and signed by his media office, the Senator stated that the President Muhammadu Buhari-led Federal Government is desirous of lifting millions of Nigerians out of poverty. He said: “As we mark Nigeria’s 59th independence anniversary, we must reflect on the past in a bid to build a prosperous nation. “Nigeria is blessed with abundant human and natural resources and as such, Nigerians deserve a good standard of living. “The government and the governed must support each other in building a Nigeria of our dream. “Every nation has its own challenges and Nigeria is not an exception. “However, the onus is on leaders at all levels to embrace the tenets of democracy anchored on good governance.” “The challenges facing the country will evaporate if all and sundry play their respective roles with utmost sincerity.” The former governor, while wishing Nigerians a hitch-free celebration, emphasised that national interest should be placed above individual interests.

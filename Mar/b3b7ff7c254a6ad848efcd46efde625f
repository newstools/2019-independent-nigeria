German Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Mueller criticised the child sex abuse conviction of his fellow cardinal, Australia’s George Pell, as being unsound. “I don’t know anything more than what was reported in the media. But it’s terrible when people’s reaction is based not on the truth but by the bias of their ideology,’’ Mueller told dpa in Rome. “How can somebody be convicted of an unproven crime, especially when you think that many people were already in jail whose innocence was later established,’’ he added. Pell, the Vatican’s former finance chief, was sentenced to six years in prison on Wednesday for sexually assaulting two choirboys in a Melbourne cathedral in the mid-1990s. He denies all accusations against him and plans to appeal the conviction. Mueller is an arch-conservative and leading critic of Pope Francis, who used to lead the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith until 2017. The congregation is the Vatican’s discipline department, responsible, among other things, for investigating and punishing priests accused of sexual abuse. Earlier this month, Mueller told the National Catholic Register he considered the allegations behind Pell’s conviction as “absolutely unbelievable’’ and “without proof.’’

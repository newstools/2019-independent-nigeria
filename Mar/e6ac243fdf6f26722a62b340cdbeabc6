US President Donald Trump claims his former lawyer Michael Cohen “directly asked” him for a pardon and lied under oath when testifying before Congress last week. “Bad lawyer and fraudster Michael Cohen said under sworn testimony that he never asked for a Pardon. His lawyers totally contradicted him. He lied!” Trump tweeted today, while aboard Air Force One according to 9news.com.au. “Additionally, he directly asked me for a pardon. I said NO. He lied again! He also badly wanted to work at the White House. He lied!” Cohen said in his open testimony before the House that he “never” asked for a pardon. “I have never asked for it, nor would I accept a pardon from President Trump,” Cohen said before the House Intelligence Committee. He responded to Trump today, tweeting: “Just another set of lies by @POTUS @realdonaldtrump.”

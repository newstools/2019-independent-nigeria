The so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported Thursday that some 120 militants of the US-sponsored Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have formed a “smuggling network,” which works to secure the escape of Daesh terrorists and their family members from Baghouz village in the eastern province of Dayr al-Zawr; the final piece of land still held by the Takfiri outfit. The militants then help the fugitives reach SDF-controlled northern border areas near Turkey and receive “hefty bribes” in return, it added. The report claimed, however, that several members of the network have been arrested by SDF’s “intelligence services,” while others remain at large. The monitoring group based its report on information obtained from sources inside Baghouz, the Kurdish-controlled areas and the Turkish territory. The United States has long been providing the SDF — a predominantly Kurdish alliance of militants — with arms and militants, calling them a key partner in the purported fight against Daesh. Such support has only angered Washington’s NATO ally, Turkey, which views militants of the People’s Protection Units (YPG), the backbone of the SDF, as a terrorist organization tied to the homegrown Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) militant group. The PKK has been fighting for autonomy inside Turkey for decades. Turkey launched two military operations against the YPG and Daesh in northern Syria in August 2016 and January 2018, and has threatened a third should the US fail to remove the Kurdish militants from the east of the Euphrates. Washington, itself, also stands accused of supporting the Daesh terrorists, who are currently on their last legs in Syria.

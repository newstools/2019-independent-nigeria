The Lakers suffered a loss to the Eastern Conference leading Milwaukee Bucks at the Staples Center and hoped to return to winning ways against the Suns. The Suns are the bottom team in the Western Conference and was supposed to be an easy win for the Lakers. LeBron however had a frustrating game posting up a near triple double with 27 points, 16 assists and nine rebounds.

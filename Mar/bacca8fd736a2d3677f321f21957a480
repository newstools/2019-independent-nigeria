LAGOS – Hon. Daniel Igali, President of the Nigeria Wrestling Federation (NWF) has hailed Team Nigeria performance at the just concluded ranking series tournaments in Germany and Bulgaria. Igali said that the tournaments were good for the athletes and it would help them in performing better in future. “It was a good outing for the country and I want to thank the athletes for their performance, especially Odunayo Adekuoroye. “They really did their best and they did not disappoint. The tournament will surely help them in future tournaments”, said Igali. It would be recalled that world silver-medalist, Odunayo Adekuoroye won bronze in the 57kg class at the just-concluded Dan Kolov-Nikola Petrov ranking series tournament in Ruse, Bulgaria. The two-time Commonwealth champion, who won a gold medal in a similar tournament in Germany a few days earlier, humiliated Sweden’s Sara Lindborg 10-0 via technical superiority in the bronze medal match. After brilliantly dispatching her opponents in the earlier rounds, Adekuoroye narrowly lost 6-4 to eventual champion, Ningning Rong of China in the semifinal. Meanwhile, Adekuoroye’s compatriot and Commonwealth champion, Aminat Adeniyi fell short of her desire to win a medal in the 62kg category as she was stopped by Luisa Niemesch, the German prevailing 12-1 in the repechage. The other Nigerian at the tournament, Blessing Oborududu, also a Commonwealth gold-medalist, was stopped in the quarterfinal of the 68kg weight class by Alla Cherkaskova. The Ukrainian defeated the eight-time African champion 8-5. Oborududu had earlier won a bronze medal at the Grand Prix of Germany ranking event in Dormagen a few days earlier. In the two ranking tournaments in Germany and Bulgaria, Team Nigeria clinched three medals; one gold and two bronze medals, with Adekuoroye accounting for two medals.

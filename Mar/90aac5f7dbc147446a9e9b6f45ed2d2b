We so much have implicit confidence in the ability of Barr Okwukwu to douse the tension,” Isiguzoro said. He said the safety of Igbo in Lagos ahead of the governorship elections in Lagos on March 9th 2019 was necessary, adding that Igbo would vote for candidates of their choice as adopted by Ohanaeze Ndigbo and, therefore, urged them to support the peaceful conduct of the election.

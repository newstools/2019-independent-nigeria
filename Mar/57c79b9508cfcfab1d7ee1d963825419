Former Manchester United star Ryan Giggs backed acting boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer Monday to permanently take the Old Trafford top job but called their upcoming Champions League fixture against PSG a “big ask”. “I can’t see anyone past Ole at the moment. The record they’ve had in the league has been phenomenal,” Giggs said at a Champions League trophy tour event in Johannesburg. “It’s a tough league and to put together the run that he’s done, it’s impressive. The Liverpool game, OK it wasn’t one of the best performances but they dug out a result.” United will face an uphill struggle on Wednesday when they confront an invigorated Paris side who lead them 2-0. “With the injuries we’ve got, the position we’re in, going to Paris is a tough place to go,” Giggs told AFP. “Away from home has been — and they’ve been fine at Old Trafford — but the really impressive performances have been away from home. “The players they’ve got are suited to playing away from home. “It’s a tough ask, but not impossible.” Giggs, who along with Phil and Gary Neville, David Beckham and Paul Scholes was part of United’s celebrated ’92 vintage, now coaches Wales. Winger Giggs stepped straight from the pitch into United’s backroom staff as a player-coach assistant to David Moyes in 2013. When Moyes was sacked, Giggs took over as caretaker boss until the end of the season, before moving fully into coaching at the club under Louis van Gaal. Giggs described the Champions League title race “as the openest season I’ve seen for a long time”.

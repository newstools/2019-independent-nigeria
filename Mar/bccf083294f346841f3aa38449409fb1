R. Kelly broke down in tears while filming a new interview as he denied allegations he has kept women as sex slaves against their will. The R&B star sobbed during the CBS This Morning interview with Gayle King as he discussed the docu-series, Surviving R. Kelly, which details decades of sexual abuse allegations against him and accusations of underage sex. Since the project aired in January, the I Believe I Can Fly singer has spent a weekend in prison awaiting a court hearing on 10 felony aggravated sex abuse charges for allegedly assaulting four victims, three of whom were underage. The controversy has also affected his tour dates in America and overseas, while lawyers representing his ex-wife have threatened him with charges for failing to pay child support. The interview, which was taped on Tuesday (Mar 5) was Kelly’s first interview since he was arrested and King asked the singer if he has ever held women against their will. The interview quickly went left as Kelly yelled, “I’m fighting for my f**king life!” at the camera. “I don’t need to [hold women against their will],” he said. “Why would I…? How stupid would I be to do that?” He then turned to one of the cameras and added: “Use your common sense. Forget the blogs, forget how you feel about me, hate me if you want to… but use your common sense. How stupid would it be for me, with my crazy past and what I’ve been through… oh, right now I need to be a monster and hold girls against their will, chain them up in my basement and don’t let them eat and don’t let them out…” He sobbed: “Stop it. Quit playing. I didn’t do this stuff. This is not me. I’m fighting for my f**king life!” Kelly also reminded King he had already been acquitted of an underage sex charge and told the interviewer, “People are going back to my past… and they are trying to add all of this stuff, now, to that… I beat my case… You can’t double jeopardy me like that. It’s not fair.”

LAGOS – Ike Shorunmu, the former Super Eagles goalkeeper and trainer, has called for support to the team ahead of their participation in the Africa Cup of Nations taking place in Egypt. He noted that with adequate support to the team, they would get as far as possible in Egypt, while commending the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) for their assistance to the team so far, urging them to do more. “They (NFF) have been very supportive of the team and that is very commendable. But at this time, I want them to do everything in terms of support to prepare them very well for them to represent Nigeria very well. “It is not all about the NFF, Nigerians should support the team to do well because that support is what they need at this time,” Shorunmu told DAILY INDEPENDENT. Nigeria will play Seychelles in the last qualifiers for the Cup of Nation with the match being insignificant for both countries after the Super Eagles have already qualified and the Indian Ocean country already out of the race for the continental showpiece. Meanwhile, both South Africa and Libya will be fighting for the second qualifying ticket in Group E of the qualifiers and both countries will meet in Tripoli with South Africa needing to avoid a defeat in order to qualify while Libya must defeat the former apartheid enclave to go through.

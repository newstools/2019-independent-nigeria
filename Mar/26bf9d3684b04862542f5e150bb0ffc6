IBADAN – Amanze Uchegbulam, former vice president of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), has warned Super Eagles against underrating Seychelles in the March 22 last Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifier. He disclosed this to DAILY INDEPENDENT at the Lekan Salami Stadium, Ibadan, on Thursday during a novelty tie between Soccer Ambassadors and Family United By Sports (FUBS) as part of programme for the burial of late Chief Taiwo Ogunjobi. “They should forget that Nigeria has qualified for the AFCON and go out there to prove that the qualification was not a fluke. “Besides, it will be good for the team to end the qualifiers on a winning note. The match may not be as easy as all are expecting and that is more reasons why the players must be very careful,” he said. Among the players for Soccer Ambassadors were former Commissioner for Sports in Oyo State, Hon. Leye Adepoju, and while among FUBS were ex- internationals Mutiu Adepoju, Ike Shorumi, Austin Eguaveon, Dimeji Lawal as well as NFF first Vice President, Seyi Akinwunmi. The remains of Ogunjobi will be committed to mother earth on Friday (today) after a funeral service at Living Spring Church, Ojoor, Ibadan. It will be recalled that Ogunjobi died on February 11 at the University College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan, at the age of 65.

LAGOS – Against the bank drop of the clamour by Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) to obtain loan from banks to develop their businesses, Mrs. Ibuku Awosika, Group Chairman First Bank of Nigeria, has clarified that commercial bank money in form of loans has always been expensive for SMEs because of the high interest rates involved. Awosika in a question and answer session with the media in Lagos said generally, commercial bank loan sometimes was too expensive for SMEs because of their size, knowledge and their skills in running profitable businesses. She explained that instead of jumping to begin to give those loans, the bank had been developing investing in their skills and knowledge gap through training before partnering with institutions such as the Bank of Industry (BoI). “What we have been doing is to invest heavily in organising programmes that will help develop the knowledge and the skills of those in entrepreneurship business, which form the small and medium enterprises that we are talking about. “As we invest in their development and knowledge, we are also facilitating their ability for them to have the right kind of financing for the business. We worked very closely with the bank of industry to develop the kind of sustainable financing that SMEs can apply for. This is because what we sell is based on the cost at which we get the money. If you give us deposit, you expect us to pay you 13 per cent of the interest; we cannot give out a loan at anything below that because we are going to incur cost in the process.” The Group Chairman, who said she grew up in a small business all the way to where she is now, noted further that she understood the SMEs sector well.

Lagos – The Super Falcons of Nigeria forfeited a 3-0 lead in the first half of their second group C match at the ongoing Cyprus Women’s Cup to beat Slovakia 4-3 on Friday. Rita Chikwelu brace in the 7th and 38th minutes and Osinachi Ohale strike put the Super Falcons ahead in the first half of the match but Slovakia fought back gallantly in the second half. Their efforts paid off as the Super Falcons conceded two penalties which were scored by Lucia Haršanyová in the 73rd and 78th minutes before Jana Vojteková levelled scores for the Slovakians. However, as the match gets closer to the end of the referee’s whistle, Nigerian Women Premier League (NWPL) top scorer, Anam Imo, who came from the bench, scored the final goal of the match in the 82nd minutes to give the Super Falcons the needed victory over their opponents. Imo, who currently plays for Nasarawa Amazons in the NWPL thus dented the hopes of the Slovakains in running away with a draw. SATURDAY INDEPENDENT gathered that the result was an improvement on the part of the Super Falcons who lost 4-1 in their first match of the competition to Austria. The Super Falcons will on Monday play their last group C match against Belgium while the competition comes to an end on Wednesday, March 6. Apart from the Super Falcons of Nigeria, three other FIFA Women’s World Cup qualifiers, namely Italy, South Africa and Thailand are competing in Cyprus alongside  Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, North Korea, Mexico and Slovakia.

LAGOS – The Enugu Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (ECCIMA) has concluded arrangement to meet with President Muhammadu Buhari next week over the completion of the permanent site of the Enugu International Trade fair complex. Emeka Okereke, Director General of the Chamber, disclosed this yesterday while speaking during a courtesy visit to the headquarters of Independent Newspapers Limited (INL), publishers of DAILY INDEPENDENT, in Lagos in the company of Emmanuel Nwankpa, Vice President of the chamber to intimate the newspaper house on the forthcoming 30th international trade fair of the chamber. He decried what he described as the Federal Government’s insensitivity to the completion of the permanent site of the Enugu International Trade Fair; unlike it did with the Lagos and Kaduna trade fairs. He lamented that in spite of appeals and efforts made by ECCIMA, and other stakeholders over the years, the Federal Government had not done anything meaningful on the site since 2007. “Nothing has changed since 2007, but what we are doing presently is that we are using our limited resources to do what we are doing there in terms of infrastructure development. We are keeping faith that the Federal Government will do it. “We have made several efforts; in fact, there is no year that we have not got to the extent of discussing with stakeholders, the ministers, the only person we have not seen is the President over the last years. “We even say hand over the project to us, the private sector, they said no, we even went to the extent of asking them to hand over the project to the state ,they said no, Enugu State applied, say hand over to us to develop, they said no. So, these are the efforts we have made, they are saying they are going to use the ICR to do it; since 2012 there is no effect from the ICR or the ministry,” he lamented.

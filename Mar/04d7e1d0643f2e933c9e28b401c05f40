The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has said it would issue loans at 5 per cent interest without collateral to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) through the NIRSAL Micro Finance Bank (MFB). Mr. Godwin Emefiele, the CBN Governor, made the declaration at the tour of the Nigeria Incentive-Based Risk Sharing System for Agricultural Lending (NIRSAL) MFB in Abuja yesterday. He said the loan would be issued under the Agri-Business Small and Medium Enterprises Investment Scheme (AGSMEIS), an initiative of the Banker’s Committee. Emefiele said the loan would run for tenure of seven years with two years moratorium. He emphasised that the fund, made up of 5 per cent Profit After Tax (PAT) from Deposit Money Bank’s (DMBs), was being set aside to support the SMEs in agriculture and other types of small businesses. According to him, the initial capital base of the bank N5bn, noting that accessing credit facility was a major hindrance to SMEs development because of their inability to provide collateral. He, however, said that SMEs operators would access the loans without necessarily providing any collateral. “The asset that we are financing for them will act as the collateral. That collateral will be registered in our national collateral registry as something that is eligible to serve as collateral or security for a loan that has been taken. “We truly need to be able to set up MFBs that will reach out to the unbanked and help deepen financial inclusion. That way we will make it easy for people to access credit, particularly the small and unbanked people because we have always said that these are the very weak along the chain.

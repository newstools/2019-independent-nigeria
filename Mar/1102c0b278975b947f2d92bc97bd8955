Ten-man Rangers International of Enugu were forced to a 1-1 draw by their hosts, Salitas FC in a CAF Confederation Cup Group B match played at Stade du 4 Aout in Ouagadougou on Sunday. The Group B is topped by CS Sfaxien,who have secured quarterfinal qualification on nine points, while fellow Tunisians, Etoile du Sahel, are second with seven, and the remaining two places are taken up by Rangers on five points and and Salitas (four). Rangers saw less of the ball than their hosts but looked more fluid in attack, having more shots through the course of the first half. And the Nigerian side was rewarded with the opening goal in the 33rd minute, as Ifenyi George got the better of goalkeeper Diakite Daouda to make it 1-0. Rangersâ€™ goal arrived despite being down to 10 men, with Semiu Liadi sent off for a second bookable offence inside the opening half hour. Salitas needed just five minutes of the second half to hit back and level the game, with Ilasse Sawadogo netting to make it 1-1. That proved to be the last goal of the match, as the teams settled for a draw. The teams will wrap up their group stage campaigns next weekend, with Salitas away to Etoile du Sahel and Ranger at home to Sfaxien.

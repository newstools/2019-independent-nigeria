FC Ifeanyi Ubahâ€™s resolve to hold onto the leadership of Group B table will be tested on Sunday as the Anambra Warriors take the title fight to Kano for a date with Kano Pillars in a tricky tie. FC IfeanyiUbah top the table with 18 points from 10 matches, while their visitors are fifth with 14 points from nine games. But the Sai Masu Gida can draw hope from the fact that IfeanyiUbah are not invincible even at their home having already lost a home match this season when Abia Warriors defeated them 2-1 in Nnewi. But for that home loss, IfeanyiUbah have remained invisible at home, winning all other four matches they played in Nnewi this season and taking points away as they hope to do in Kano this weekend. For Pillars, but for the goalless draw they recorded against Plateau United in Jos in week three, they have lost all their away ties, fallen to El-Kanemi Warriors 1-2 in Maiduguri, Gombe United 0-2 in Gombe and 1-2 to Go Round FC in Omoku. But at home, they have shown resilience, which they hope to continue against the Anambra Warriors. With this statistics, it is obvious that IfeanyiUbah may find the match this weekend tough even though pundits have predicted a tough game, with Kano Pillars highly favoured to win the match.

China and Russia have continued to defy the United States on Venezuela, vowing to assist the cash-strapped and crisis-stricken government being targeted by President Donald Trump. Venezuela has been hit by major power outages in recent days, deepening a political feud between President Nicolás Maduro and opposition leader Juan Guaidó, the National Assembly head who declared himself head of state in January. Washington has endorsed Guaidó, while Beijing and Moscow have backed Maduro, who has accused his opponent of conspiring with foreign allies that conducted a cyberattack to cause the blackout according to newsweek.com. During a press briefing Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lu Kang appeared to back Maduro’s version of events, saying China “expressed concern that the accident was caused by a cyber attack on the Venezuelan power supply system.” “The Chinese side hopes that the party will find out the cause of the accident as soon as possible and restore normal power supply and social order. China is willing to provide assistance and technical support for the restoration of the power system,” Lu told reporters, later reiterating that “China is willing to provide assistance to the Venezuelan power system to the best of its ability.”

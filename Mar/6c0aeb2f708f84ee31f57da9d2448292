Kenyan athletics chiefs said on Thursday they would oppose the decision by world governing body IAAF to drop the 5,000m and 10,000m from the lucrative Diamond League circuit. Athletics Kenya (AK) President Jackson Tuwei said it was “totally unfair” to drop the two events in which African athletes have been doing very well. Ethiopia’s long distance great Haile Gebrselassie said the decision to limit the longest event in the circuit to 3,000m will disproportionately affect Kenya and Ethiopia. Both countries are two powerhouses of middle and long-distance running. The IAAF said on Monday the circuit would have a trimmer look and fewer meetings as the one-day competitions aim for a more consistent and fast moving format. Meetings will be reduced from 14 to 12 competitions, while the number of disciplines will be cut from 32 to 24 with 12 each for men and women.

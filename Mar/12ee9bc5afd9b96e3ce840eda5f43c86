P/Harcourt – No fewer than 58 governorship candidates on Friday accused the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), to exclude names of some political parties from participating in the governorship and House of Assembly elections in Rivers State. They also condemned the partisan role of the Nigerian Army in the last elections in Rivers State which led to the death of over 30 persons. Speaking under the aegis of Rivers State coalition of governorship candidates, the chairman of the group, Pastor Samuel Ihunwo alleged that INEC was colluding with the state chapter of the APC to sabotage the next elections. “While the people of Rivers State are yet to recover from the pains and trauma of awful violence and bloodletting that characterized last week’s general elections, we have intercepted yet another heinous plan to deliberately sabotage the March 9th 2019 Governorship and House of Assembly elections in Rivers State in order to advance the partisan interest of the All Progressives Congress (APC), a party that is not on the ballot for the said elections. “According to credible intelligence, the APC has successfully compromised the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to exclude the name and logo of one of the political parties from the ballot papers for the Governorship and State House of Assembly elections in Rivers State”. Ihunwo stated that after the plot, the supposedly excluded political party would proceed to the Governorship Election Petition Tribunal to inevitably nullify the outcomes of the March 9th Governorship and House of Assembly elections in Rivers State.

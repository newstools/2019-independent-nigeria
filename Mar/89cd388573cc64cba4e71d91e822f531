Although the Nigerian-based auto industry jobs have declined for several decades now, thousands of Nigerians still make a living designing, building and selling cars “Beyond the initial purchase, every car continues to cost its owner money, hence, leading to a broader economic impact. For instance, cars require fuel, which itself constitutes a major expense. Regular maintenance and repair following an accident, along with car insurance, are all additional costs to car owners. It is also an opportunities for secondary businesses to thrive”, it said.

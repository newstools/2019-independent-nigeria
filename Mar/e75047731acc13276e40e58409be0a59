Lagos – Team Nigeria may miss out of the 2019 African Senior Wrestling Championships in Hammamet, Tunisia from March 26 to 31 due to lack of funds. DAILY INDEPENDENT gathered that as at the close of registration of athletes on Tuesday, March 5 the Nigeria Wrestling Federation (NWF) are yet to purchase the licences of her wrestlers and secure accommodation fees ahead of the continental championships for Cadets, Juniors and Seniors. As host of the event last year, Nigeria emerged overall champions of the tournament in Port Harcourt; claiming victory in both the Freestyle (men) and Women’s wrestling. Such was the dominance of Nigeria in Women Wrestling at the tournament in Port Harcourt that her athletes won nine of the available 10 gold medals, in addition to a silver medal. Emeka Dennar, Media Officer of the NWF, said that Nigeria also paraded no fewer than 25 reigning African Champions in the different weight classes at the moment. Amongst them are Blessing Oborududu, Aminat Adeniyi, Odunayo Adekuoroye, Hannah Reuben, Mercy Genesis, Emmanuel Nworie, Bose Samuel, Ifeoma Nwoye, Sunmisola Balogun, Amas Daniel, Emmanuel Ogbonnya John and Ekerekemo Agiomor. According to Dennar, failure to compete in Hammamet means Nigeria would also miss out of the 2019 World Championships in Kazakhstan in September since the African Championships is a qualifier for the global event. “The ripple effect is that Nigeria’s chances of qualifying for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, Japan will be reduced as the World Championships is the first qualification tournament for the multi-sport fiesta,” he said. DAILY INDEPENDENT also learnt that if Nigeria fails to make it to Tunisia, it will be the first time-ever that the country will be missing out of the continental event it has dominated over the years.

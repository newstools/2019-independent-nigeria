Lagos – Coach Gernor Rohr has predicted that if Nigeria prepare very well and do that in good condition, the country could reach the semifinal of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Egypt in June. The coach, who also spoke on the chances of his captain, John Mikel Obi, and the retired former winger, Victor Moses making the team for the AFCON, talked to CAF website. “If we have good preparation in good conditions, Nigeria must aim for the semifinals of AFCON 2019. We have a very young team that can do well,” he said. The coach, however, refused to pick his favourite country to win the AFCON title. While regretting a knee injury that kept the former Chelsea star, Mikel, out for greater part of last season in the Chinese Super League, Rohr said the player had not been ruled out of the AFCON. ”He has arrived in Middleborough recently. He told me he was not ready and needs to work after his knee injury in China. ”He did not play all winter either. He is not ruled out for the AFCON but could not make that match in Asaba. We will see for the future. Meanwhile, the coach said that even though he was not happy that Victor Moses, Super Eagles’ former winger, left the national team when he did, the door was not closed against him ahead of the AFCON. ”I was against his international retirement and, if he changed his mind, he must tell me but I have no information about it. We’ll see.” The Chelsea loanee is enjoying a new lease of life at Turkish side Fenerbahce, for whom he has scored two goals in the last six matches in the Super Lig, and there was speculation he was to be recalled for this month’s games against Seychelles and Egypt, which has not happened.

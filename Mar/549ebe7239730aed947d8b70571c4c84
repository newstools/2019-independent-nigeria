R.Kelly’s battle appears to be turning for the worse as he sent back to jail again and this time, its for his failure to pay child support. AcR. Kelly was taken out of the courtroom, after his arrest. No official word from the court has been issued, but it would appear he didn’t cough up the $161k for child support. Sources connected to the embattled singer tell us Kelly hasn’t covered the $161,633 he owes to his ex-wife, Drea Kelly. This is coming barely 24 hours after clips from R.Kelly’s now famous interview with Gayle King broke the Internet. R.Kelly has denied all the sexual abuse allegations leveled against in a first interview since his release. In an interview with Gayle King on ‘CBS This Morning’ the music icon denied all the sexual abuse allegations and allegations that he manipulated women into staying with him in emotionally and physically abusive relationships leveled against him. “Hate me if you want to, love me if you want, But just use your common sense. How stupid would it be for me, with my crazy past and what I’ve been through — oh, right now I just think I need to be a monster, hold girls against their will, chain them up in my basement, and don’t let them eat, don’t let them out!” he said.

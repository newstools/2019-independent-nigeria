Ahmad Tijjani Abdul Kano – The Appeal Court in Kaduna, presided over by Justice Daniel O. Kalio, on Thursday confirmed Engr. Abba Kabir Yusuf as the bona fide Kano State Peoples Democratic Party’s (PDP) governorship candidate in Saturday poll. While delivering judgment, the Appeal Court granted all the prayers put forward by the appellants. The PDP sought a stay of execution on the previous judgment passed by a Federal High Court in Kano on the validity of the party’s October 2 primaries. The Appeal Court also restrained INEC from removing the name of Engr. Abba Kabir Yusuf and other PDP candidates from the list of 2019 contestants. Responding shortly after the verdict, Engr. Abba Kabir Yusuf said he was not surprised with the outcome from the Appeal Court. “As I always mentioned, the case mainly concerns our party and an aggrieved member who is working with the ruling All Progressives Party (APC) in the state to remedy the fast-growing unpopularity of Gov. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje,” Yusuf said. He also called on his supporters and PDP faithful to keep their hope alive and come out en masse to vote for all PDP candidates.

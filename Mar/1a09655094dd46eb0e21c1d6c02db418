Awka – Ebele Leonard Ejiofor, the People’s Democratic Party House (PDP) of Assembly-elect for Anaocha 2 State Constituency, has said that he is not going to the state Assembly to be part of conspiracy or plot to remove Governor Willie Obiano from office. He said that his second coming to the legislative chambers is to ensure that the House performed its constitutional duties. He observed that the present Legislature consist of 28 All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) legislators and only two PDP lawmakers, stressing that the present status quo was responsible for the poor checks and balances between the Legislature and the Executive arms of government. Ejiofor, who spoke to journalists at his country-home in Adazi-Nnukwu Anaocha Local Government Area of the state on Monday, maintained that the Legislature in Anambra has not been vibrant due to what he termed one-party system, pointing out that the lawmaking organ required vibrant and virile opposition to check and balance the Executive arm for effective governance. The PDP Assembly-elect further disclosed that there were too many uncompleted road projects across the state and it takes a Legislature with active opposition to dig deep to uncover how the contracts were awarded and why too many uncompleted road projects exist in the state. Ejiofor, who had represented his constituency in the state Assembly on the platform of APGA, after which he defected to the PDP due to what he mentioned as unfair treatment, noticed also that APGA was no longer what it used to be. He alleged that the party has been hijacked by a few individuals for personal aggrandizement. He, however, emphasized that he was currently touring communities in his constituency to obtain first-hand information on the felt-needs of his constituents, adding that Enugwu-Adazi has not had electricity for three years while some other villages lacked potable water and other social amenities.

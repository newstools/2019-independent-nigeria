Batista and Triple H could have a feud for the ages as the build towards WWE WrestleMania 35 continues, and it sounds like “The Animal” could make an appearance on the Mar. 11 episode of Raw in Pittsburgh.
A couple of weeks ago in Atlanta, Batista ruined a WWE Raw episode celebration of Ric Flair’s 70th birthday by brutally attacking Flair backstage and dragging the former Evolution leader’s body out of the locker room. Batista screamed like “The Animal” that he is, sending a message to Triple H that “The Game” absolutely had to respond. Last week on Raw, Triple H addressed Batista, cutting a scathing promo on his former stablemate. The promo was an awesome one, too, and it got the WWE Universe even more hyped for this likely WrestleMania match.

Instead, he cut a promo on Instagram dissing the City of Brotherly Love, stating that he didn’t “want to be there”. He then played it coy, telling Triple H that he also doesn’t like Pittsburgh and may or may not show up on the Mar. 11 episode of Raw either. Per PWInsider.com’s Mike Johnson, Batista has been spotted in Pittsburgh. It looks likely that he’ll be on the post-Fastlane episode of Raw to have a face-to-face promo battle with Triple H, who had some strong words for him last week. This could be a confrontation for the ages, given the awesomeness that has transpired over the past couple of weeks, and there’s little doubt that Batista, a legitimately great actor, still has “it” as a performer and talker.

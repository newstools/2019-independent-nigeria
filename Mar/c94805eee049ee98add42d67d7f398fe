Anti-government protesters took to the streets in Algiers as aides of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika were finalizing his registration for a fifth election run. The so-called “living dead” leader is rarely seen in public. Hundreds of police and soldiers were deployed in Algeria’s capital, Algiers, on Sunday as President Abdelaziz Bouteflika reportedly registered to run for a highly controversial fifth term in office. The country has been gripped by widespread protests all week over Bouteflika’s decision, with at least one protester being killed in clashes with police. A crowd of mostly students in the center of the capital kept the days of protest going, chanting “Bouteflika go away!” There were reports of similar demonstrations taking place in towns and cities throughout the country. Despite the outrage, Bouteflika’s team managed to file the papers confirming he would seek re-election, according to a report from a private Ennahar TV station cited by Reuters. Separately, state news agency APS published Bouteflika’s asset declaration, which is another requirement to take part in the race.

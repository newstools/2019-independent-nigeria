Lagos – Gbenga Ogunbote, Rangers International of Enugu coach, has apologised to the team’s fans and staying upbeat over their chances of qualifying for the next stage of the CAF Confederation Cup, despite losing 2-0 at home to Etoile du Sahel of Tunisia on Sunday. Sunday’s defeat at Enugu meant Rangers fell in back-to-back games against the same team, having lost the first leg 2-1 away, but Ogunbote said that they still have strong hope of making it to the knock-out stage of the second-tier continental clubs’ competition. “First, I would like to apologize to the fans for the disappointing result. We let them down and we take full responsibility. “We were not good enough and our players did not play like they used to. We also were naive defensively and we paid dearly for it. “However, we still have our destiny in our own hands. It is a huge setback but I strongly believe we can qualify for the knock-out stage. “It starts with our performance next Sunday against Salitas in Burkina Faso. If we play to our strength and with full determination, I am very sure we can get a result,” he said. Ogunbote promised that they would all work hard to ensure they progress from the group. He added that they must now look beyond the game and correct their mistakes ahead of their final two fixtures in the group which they must win to stand a chance of qualifying for the knock-out stage. The Flying Antelopes are third in Group B of the competition with four points behind Etoile du Sahel and CS Sfaxien and on the brinks of elimination from the competition. After travelling to play Salitas, Rangers will be back at home in Enugu against CS Sfaxien. A win in both matches will likely see Rangers making it to the quarterfinal, though highly dependent on the result of the other group games.

LAGOS – Activities in the domestic equities market last week responded to several factors including abating political risks, positive earnings releases and dividend declarations. Despite these positives, market sentiments have remained weak with unimpressive dividend yields dampening sentiments further. At the start of the week, the benchmark index posted gains of 0.95 per cent and 0.14 per cent on Monday and Tuesday respectively due to bargain hunting in Guaranty Trust Bank, Zenith Bank, Union Bank Nigeria and International Breweries. However, by midweek the market maintained a downtrend till week close, shedding 0.80 per cent cumulatively due to profit-taking in Zenith Bank, Dangote Cement and Guaranty Trust Bank as well as sell pressures on Ecobank Transnational Incorporated, Seplat Petroleum Development Company and Nigerian Breweries. As a result, the All Share Index closed the week at 31,924.51 points, up 0.3 per cent Week-on-Week (W-o-W) while Year-To-Date (YTD) return settled at 1.6 per cent. Activity level however, strengthened as average volume traded climbed by 1.6 per cent to N355.7 million units, while average value traded rose 21.0 per cent to N4.8 billion.

Comrade Timi Frank, former Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has enjoined the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai, to publicly apologise to him, saying that the military’s indictment by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) over its disruptive role in the Governorship and State Assembly elections in Rivers State has vindicated him. Frank, in his reaction to a statement released by the INEC on Saturday in Abuja, where the electoral body expressed displeasure over the role played by armed military personnel during the Rivers State governorship election, said he had been vindicated. The former APC’s deputy national spokesman said he had raised the alarm and called on the military authorities to be neutral before the election, adding that instead of the security agency to heed his call, “Buratai and his co-politicians in military uniform disregarded it and tagged him as a protagonist of fake news.” According to the INEC’s statement on the Rivers State gubernatorial election, “Collation centres were invaded by some soldiers and armed gangs resulting in the intimidation and unlawful arrest of election officials thereby disrupting the collation process.” It would be recalled that Frank had issued a statement exposing plans by the APC’s government to militarise the Rivers State governorship election, but was denied in some quarters. While describing the military’s involvement in the 2019 general elections as shameful, Frank said “if the likes of Buratai and his cohorts” were tired of wearing military uniforms “they should form a political party or publicly register as a department under the APC.” The political activist challenged the military to name just one country in Africa or the entire world where their colleagues have brazenly taken sides during elections “like what Nigeria witnessed in both the presidential, National Assembly and governorship elections?

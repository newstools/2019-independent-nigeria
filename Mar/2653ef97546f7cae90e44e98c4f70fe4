Real Madrid have signalled their intent to secure the £100 million ($132m) summer signing of Chelsea star Eden Hazard, Goal understands. Their interest in the Belgian represents the first proper contact ahead of a potential summer move. The appointment of Hazard’s idol Zinedine Zidane as Santiago Solari’s replacement at the Bernabeu could prove decisive in making up the 28-year-old’s mind. Hazard has already described a move to Spain’s capital as a “dream”, with Madrid having frequently been linked with the former Lille winger over the last couple of years. Chelsea are asking for around £100m from the reigning European champions, who are aiming to get the asking price down. Madrid are keen to maintain a positive relationship with the west London club in the negotiations, as they did in the process of securing the signing of Thibaut Courtois from the Blues in 2018. Blancos president Florentino Perez is hoping the reappointment of Zidane will lead to a summer rebuild, with Madrid also linked with Paris Saint-Germain duo Kylian Mbappe and Neymar. Perez hopes that the presence of the France legend at the helm once more might tempt Mbappe to Madrid. “Zidane’s French so maybe he could do something with Mbappe,” Perez, with a laugh, told reporters. Neymar has also been rumoured as a Madrid target, with reports suggesting the club would shatter the transfer record PSG paid for the Brazilian while offering to make him the highest-paid footballer in the world. It has also been reported that such a move would take Madrid out of the race, at least in the short term, for Mbappe, given the cost of landing both stars. However, when asked who he would choose between the two PSG stars, Perez instead answered “Both.”

Unidentified political thugs in the early hours of Saturday attacked the Ezza North Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) office, destroying sensitive materials meant for the gubernatorial and state assembly elections. The hoodlums also burnt down Community Secondary School, Okposi Unuoghara 07, in the area. A source in the area said the thugs were suspected to working for the All Progressives Congress (APC) guber candidate, Senator Sonni Ogbuoji. The hoodlums also attacked the RAC office and burnt down some INEC materials at the community secondary school Okposi Unuoghara 07, Ezza North Local Government Area and set the school building ablaze last night. When contacted the State Police Public Relation Officer, ASP Loveth Odah, confirmed the attack. She said: “I got a call from the area that the RAC was under attack just few minutes ago. I am rushing back to command to ramp up response to the situation,” she said. As at the time of filing this report, no life was lost.

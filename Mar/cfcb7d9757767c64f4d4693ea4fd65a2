Ifeanyi Anaemena of Enyimba International has promised to score against Sunshine Stars in a week-11 match scheduled for the Akure Township Stadium on Sunday. It will be recalled that the seven-time Nigerian champions are still searching for their first away victory in the season and the forward has insisted that could end in Akure as the Peoples Elephants, he noted, were poised to take the match to the homers on Sunday. Both Anaemena and Bashir Abdulrahman were on target as Enyimba deservedly defeated nine-man Katsina United in Aba penultimate Wednesday and the team also forced Bendel Insurance to a goalless draw in Benin on Sunday to move the Peoples Elephants three points behind Group A leaders, MFM FC. Meanwhile, Anaemena said that he and other forwards would try and get the goals against Sunshine Stars on Sunday for them to move higher on the log. “We are gradually getting our rhythm back and as we won on Wednesday last week (against Katsina United) and we drew against Bendel Insurance; we will try to get the goals against Sunshine Stars because you can only win when you score goals. We want to move very far on the log and also we want to start winning away,” he said.

Amber Heard has pledged to fight the defamation lawsuit filed against her by ex-husband ,Johnny Depp branding it “frivolous” and “groundless”. Earlier this week, it was reported that Heard was the subject of a defamation lawsuit from the Mortdecai actor, who took issue with an article she wrote towards the end of last year. In the article in question –   published in December 2018 – she discusses having spoken out about domestic abuse, and the backlash she received as a result, though she pointedly does not use her ex-husband’s name at any point. The BBC has reported that in his legal papers, Depp maintains that he “never abused Ms Heard”, claiming the allegations that he did form part of an “elaborate hoax” to keep her in the spotlight. They also say he is seeking $50 million (£38 million) in damages. In a statement given to HuffPost UK, her lawyer Eric M George said of Depp’s lawsuit: “This frivolous action is just the latest of Johnny Depp’s repeated efforts to silence Amber Heard. She will not be silenced. “Mr Depp’s actions prove he is unable to accept the truth of his ongoing abusive behaviour.”

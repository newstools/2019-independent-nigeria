The Prime Minister of Italy, Giuseppe Conte said that he is working on lifting international sanctions imposed against Russia, Reuters news agency reports. During a speech at a foreign policy conference in Genoa, Conte said that sanctions that were introduced after the annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014, should not become an end in itself. In addition, in his opinion, the sanctions are ineffective and harm the Italian economy. Responding to a question if Italy wants to lift these sanctions he responded: “we are working on it.” Last year, Conte stated he was in favour of revising the sanctions imposed on Russia for aggression in Ukraine, but the sanctions continued.

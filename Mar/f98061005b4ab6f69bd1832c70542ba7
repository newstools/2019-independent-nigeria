The UK is set to exit the EU in 21 days and both sides still haven’t reached a deal. After Theresa May, again called for concessions, the EU’s negotiator offered to let the UK unilaterally leave the bloc’s customs union. The European Union should make concessions in Brexit talks to convince British lawmakers to back a controversial exit deal next week, British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Friday. The call came as Brussels and London struggle to reach an agreement to avoid a potentially damaging no-deal Brexit at the end of March according to dw.com. Later on Friday, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michael Barnier, said the EU was ready to offer Britain a unilateral exit from the bloc’s customs union while keeping other elements of the Irish backstop.

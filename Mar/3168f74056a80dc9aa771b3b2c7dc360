Speaking at the Government House, Umuahia, on Wednesday during the swearing-in ceremony, Ikpeazu, who said the appointees were carefully chosen to bring stability and victory to the PDP in Saturday’s polls, said they should ensure that peace reigns during and after elections. He charged them to ensure that they were on the same page with stakeholders and other members of the party in their areas, as well as to ward off external influences that may mar the conduct of the governorship and House of Assembly polls. Ikpeazu assured the new transition committee chairmen that their appointments were a stepping stone for greater opportunities to serve the people and the state in future and wished them well. Responding on behalf of his colleagues, the transition committee chairman of Isuikwuato Local Government Area, Chima Agbaeze, thanked the governor for the opportunity given them to serve and pledged not to disappoint him.

AWKA – Comrade Chinedu Benjamin Obidigwe, winner of the House of Representatives elections for Anambra-East and West Federal Constituency, has promised to accommodate his opponents who contested against him in the just concluded National Assembly elections. He said he would not victimise his enemies or anyone because in every contest, there is always a winner. He said that although the people of Anambra-East and West have suffered for too long a time due to poor representation, his journey to the Green Chambers was to provide quality representation to his constituents. Obidigwe who spoke to journalists in Otuocha Anambra-East council area on Sunday, said his election would usher in a new hope for his people because they have waited for too long. He said even though he was not the best, his humanitarian services as well as other poverty alleviation programmes to the people of Anambra-East and West Federal Constituency distinguished him from other contestants in the race.

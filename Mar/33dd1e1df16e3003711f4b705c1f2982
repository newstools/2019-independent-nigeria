ABUJA – The World Health Organisation (WHO) Regional Director, Dr Matshidiso Moeti, said many countries in have made great strides towards gender parity in education, health, economic and political systems, and have incorporated multisectoral actions for advancing women’s health through the life course in their national health development strategies. She made this known in her on the 2019 International Women’s Day with the theme: “Think equal, build smart, innovate for change.” She however, reaffirmed the WHO commitment to gender equality and women empowerment. She also urged all to “think equal, build smart, innovate for change” to improve health outcomes for women and girls so they can realise their potential and contribute to transformative socioeconomic and political development in the Africa region. Moeti, who was represented by the Acting Officer-in-Change (OIC) WHO Nigeria Dr Fiona Braka, said  the theme for this year is a clarion call to all of us that rapid economic and transformational development will  only be achieved by addressing and resolving the gender-based differences relating to health needs, risk behaviours, power and control over resources and information, and access to health services. According to her, “For its part, the World Health Organisation has prioritised and promoted leadership in gender, equity and rights across all its health policies and programmes with a view to achieving universal health coverage and attaining the triple billion goals set out in our new Programme of Work.” “These advances are reflected in the 2018 Global Gender Gap Report which shows that, over the past decade, our region has improved more than any other in closing the health and survival gender gap. Indeed, two countries in the region — Botswana and Lesotho — have fully closed both their educational attainment and health and survival gender gaps. “African women are increasingly occupying positions of power and influencing bolder legislation and policy-making and demonstrating to other women that they too have a voice and can make decisions on issues impacting their lives”, she stressed.

British Prime Minister, Theresa May, will ask lawmakers to rule out Britain leaving
the EU without an agreement on Wednesday, after they overwhelmingly rejected for a second time the Brexit deal she has negotiated with the EU. May’s motion asks parliament’s elected main house, the Commons, to reject a no-deal Brexit but notes that “leaving without a deal
remains the default in UK and EU law unless this house and the EU ratify an agreement.” If, as expected, the lawmakers agree the motion in a free vote, she has promised another vote on Thursday on extending the Brexit
process, just 15 days before Britain is scheduled to leave the EU on March 29. After a crushing defeat in the second “meaningful vote’’ on her Brexit deal late Tuesday, May said she remained “passionate about
delivering the result of the [2016 Brexit] referendum.” “But I equally passionately believe that the best way to do that is to leave in an orderly way with a deal and I still believe there is a
majority in the house for that course of action,” she said. “And I am conscious of my duties as prime minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. “And also the potential damage to the union that leaving without a deal could do when one part of our country is without devolved
governance,” May added. She was referring to the suspension of Northern Ireland’s power-sharing government for more than two years.

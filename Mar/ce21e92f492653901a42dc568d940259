UGHELLI North Unity Group, a political pressure group under the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) in Delta State has endorsed the state governor, Dr Ifeanyi Okowa, for a second term in office. A Communiqué issued at the end of the meeting of the body held recently, and signed by the Chairman, Hon. Akise Jowho, and Secretary, Mr Burutu Patrick, said the decision of the group to endorse Okowa was based on its conviction that he will do better than he has done in his first term as governor of Delta State. The group held that it was fair to respect the political zoning arrangement of rotation of power among the three Senatorial districts of the state for the purpose of equity. They lauded the development strides of the governor in his first tenure in the areas of infrastructure and ability to steer the economy of the state even in critical times of limited resources. The group urged all Urhobo people and believers in truth and equity to join hands and support the re-election of Okowa on March 9, 2019.

Benin – Edo State Deputy Governor, Rt. Hon. Comrade Phillip Shaibu has congratulated Edo born UFC fighter, Kamaru Usman, for becoming UFC champion. 31year-old Usman, who hails from Auchi, Edo State on Sunday March 3, 2019 in the United States of America, became the first African to emerge champion in the UFC.

To triumph the way he did to become not only the first Nigerian but the first African to pull off that amazing feat, is a testament to the indefatigable Edo spirit, which has made our state a pace setter in sports in Nigeria and its indigenes, excellent and accomplished sportsmen globally,” Hon. Shaibu said. He charged Usman not to see his victory over Woodley as an end in itself but as a stepping stone to greater accomplishments. “Greater glories lie ahead of you. You must strive harder to best the very best. Here at home we are very proud of what you have achieved. You are a worthy Edo son and ambassador,” said the sports loving Deputy Governor under whose watch and director sports in the state is returning to its place of pre-eminence of sports in Nigeria.

Kingsley Burutu Otuaro, the deputy governor of Delta State, says Deltans and increasing Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) supporters in riverine communities should leverage on military presence to troupe out en masse and vote at the governorship polls on March 9, 2019. Otuaro, who spoke in Warri at a critical stakeholders meeting of Delta South Senatorial District on Wedneday, allayed fears that the increased military presence, especially in the riverine areas of the state, might lead to intimidation or harassment of voters during the polls. “I have the instructions of the Governor of Delta State, Senator (Dr) Ifeanyi Arthur Okowa, who is the Chief Security Officer of the state, to assure you that the security forces in all parts of the state were not here to molest anyone out to peacefully exercise his or her civic responsibility of moving to and voting in the elections.  Voters therefore need not be afraid of the military presence”, Otuaro assured. “I want to advise speed boats operators conveying voters to various locations in the riverside communities in Delta South to drive carefully within reasonable speed limits. They should be conscious of sharp bends and freely raise alarm for help to the military security operatives around, in the event of imminent danger. “The security operatives have been tasked to exhibit high professionalism and are expected to protect and would not, in their duties, harass voters.” “I like to reassure you and through you to the teeming supporters of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in especially the riverine areas to come out en masse and massively vote Governor Ifeanyi Arthur Okowa and all other PDP candidates to help us continue our visible and positively impacting “prosperity for all” programmes and achieve a stronger Delta State,” Otuaro added.

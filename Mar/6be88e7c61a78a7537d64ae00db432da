Juan Guaido, the Venezuelan opposition leader trying to oust President Nicolas Maduro, has called for nationwide protests on Monday to coincide with his planned return to the country. Venezuelans should gather across the country at 11a.m. (1500 GMT) and listen to regional leaders for more information on meeting points, Guaido wrote on his Twitter. The focal point of the protests in the capital Caracas will be the central Las Mercedes Avenue, added Guaido, who has declared himself the countryâ€™s interim president. Guaido left Venezuela on Feb. 22, to travel to Colombia and other South American countries in a bid to rally support for his bid to overthrow Maduro. Maduro has said Guaido could be arrested on his return for violating a travel ban placed on him by the Supreme Court. The young opposition leader has vowed to return, nonetheless, and said that he was taking off from a naval base in Ecuador. It was not clear when he would arrive back in his home country. Venezuela is in the midst of a severe economic and political crisis.

Odion Ighalo, Super Eagles and Shanghai Shenhua of China striker, believes the team would need to work harder to make a huge impact at the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt. Ighalo is already optimistic of a historic outing at the tournament, noting that hard work and determination would take the Super Eagles to a fourth continental title in July. Ighalo vowed: “I just want us to keep the concentration level high. We are in a good direction. “We want to compete; we want to do better than what the Super Eagles before us have done in the past. “We just want to continue to work hard together as a team, not to feel relaxed just because we have gotten the ticket to the AFCON. “It’s one thing to qualify and it’s another thing to go there and perform and that is what we want to do. Who knows – everything is possible.” The last time Nigeria won the competition was at South Africa 2013, following previous conquests on home soil in 1980 and at Tunisia ’94, but Ighalo believes the current squad can do even better than those historic title-winning teams.

LAGOS – Cletus Itodo, Lobi Stars of Makurdi skipper believes they will beat Mamelodi Sundowns of South Africa on Saturday, in their next match of the 2019 CAF Champions’ League group stage. Itodo admitted it will not be an easy game, as he noted that his side will be away to a team that is very strong both tactically and technically. The 35-year-old former Sunshine Stars of Akure and Shooting Stars of Ibadan player said that he and his colleagues would give everything to have to ensure they do not lose in The Rainbow Nation. “We tried our best against Wydad Casablanca but they were the lucky team the last time. “We are going to bounce back. We need to readjust our strategy and I’m still very confident we can go all the way in this competition,” he said. Casting his mind ahead of the fixture in Nelson Mandela’s country, Itodo is staying upbeat for a historic away result, as he said the players are determined to win. According to him, the team learnt big lessons from their defeats by ASEC Mimosas of Cote d’Ivoire and Wydad Casablanca of Morocco, as well as the recent slump Rangers International of Enugu had against Etoile du Sahel in the CAF Confederation Cup.

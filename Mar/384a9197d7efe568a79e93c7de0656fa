LAGOS – Mallam Alhassan Yakmut, former Director-General of the National Sports Commission (NSC) has been appointed Team Nigeria’s Chief de Mission to the 12th African Games in Rabat Morocco later in the year. The Minister of Youth and Sports, Barrister Solomon Dalung who made the appointment said it was in recognition of his contributions to sports in the country. According to Dalung, the sports family will gain much by tapping into Yakmut’s wealth of knowledge. “The appointment of Yakmut as Chief de Mission to the African Games in Morocco in June is in recognition of his wealth of experience in sports administration and his contributions to sports. “I believe that one of the challenges of sports development is what I refer to as the ‘Theory of abandonment’. Once you are out of the system you are not associated with the sports family but once in a while, your experience is tapped into for the benefit of sports development. So I came up with the policy thrust of appointing former sports administrators and former ministers to serve in such capacity so that we can benefit from their wealth of experience. “This is to give them a sense of belonging and also recognize their contributions,” Dalung said. The Chief-de-Mission is the Games delegation operational leader, Team Manager and the Liason person between the host country and Nigeria. Yakmut is a former Professional Volleyball player and a board member of the Volleyball Federation of Nigeria.

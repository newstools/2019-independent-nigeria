The community leadership in Nembe, BayelsaState, onSunday urged the oil and gas industry regulators to wield the big stick against Aiteo Exploration Limited over alleged poor handing of an explosion within OML 29. An explosion occurred on Friday along the 97-kilometre Nembe Creek Trunk line, discharging unascertained volume of crude and gas into the environment. Although Aiteo officials confirmed the incident on Saturday, theNigerianNationalPetroleum Corporation (NNPC) insisted that there was no record of explosion in Nembe. Chief Nengi James-Eriworio, Spokesman, Nembe Chiefs Council, saidthattheNNPCwas misled because Aiteo did not reporttheincidenttoJointVenture partners as required by law. James-Eriworio said that the Nembe communities were shocked at the statement from NNPC and urged the corporation to sanction Aiteo for concealing the incident. He said that the failure to report the incident had caused the entire oil industry an avoidable embarrassment. “Nembe Chiefs Council calls on NNPC to sanction Aiteo Company for concealing a high level of leakage and a gas explosion at their facility at Nembe Creek.”

LAGOS – Odion Ighalo, Alex Iwobi and Semi Ajayi were among the early arrivals in the Super Eagles’ camp in Asaba, Delta State on Monday as the countdown began for Friday’s Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifying match against Seychelles. Nigeria have qualified for the AFCON holding in Egypt this summer, but the game is an academic affair. However, the Super Eagles want to end the qualification series on a high and maintain reputation while using the game to kick-start preparations for the AFCON proper. The match will kick off 4pm on Friday. Goalkeepers’ Francis Uzoho, Ikechukwu Ezenwa and Daniel Akpeyi are all in town, as well as home-based professionals, Ikouwem Utin, Ndifreke Effiong and Valentine Ozornwafor. The bulk of the invited group of 23 will come in on Tuesday (today), with the international friendly against the Pharaohs of Egypt on Tuesday, March 26 next week also in mind. Ikouwem Utin and Effiong made the list on account of injuries to Samuel Kalu and Ola Aina. Meanwhile, Thomas Dennerby, Head Coach of the Super Falcons has called to camp 30 home-based professionals as preparations for this summer’s FIFA Women’s World Cup finals enter a new gear. Goalkeepers Tochukwu Oluehi, Chiamaka Nnadozie and Christy Ohiaeriaku all made the list, as well as defenders Glory Ogbonna and Josephine Chukwunonye, midfielders Cecilia Nkwu, Amarachi Okoronkwo and Osarenoma Igbinovia, and forwards Alice Ogebe and Anam Imo. However, goalkeeper Alaba Jonathan, defender Ugochi Emenayo, midfielder Evelyn Nwabuoku and forward Chioma Wogu return to the fold. The nine-time African champions, who have been to tournaments in China and Cyprus as part of preparations for the big global fiesta in France, playing six matches in all, are scheduled to play two matches in Spain in the first week of April to further put themselves in shape for the finals.

Ibadan – Seyi Akinwunmi, First Vice President of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), has said that nothing would be too much to honour late Taiwo Ogunjobi, former secretary general of the football house. Akinwunmi, in a chat with DAILY INDEPENDENT during a symposium organised for the former scribe of the NFF held at Lekan Salami Stadium, Ibadan on Wednesday, said Ogunjobi had paid his dues in the country’s football history. “He was a player, a match official and an astute administrator. He is loved by all and we cannot deny the fact that he was part of those that contributed to the development of our football,” said Akinwunmi. DAILY INDEPENDENT learnt that the symposium was put in place by the Western Nigeria Football Forum on behalf of the NFF. There will be lying-in-state for the late Ogunjobi on Thursday (today) before a Christian Wake keep for him later in the day. Ogunjobi died on Monday, February 11 at the University College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan.

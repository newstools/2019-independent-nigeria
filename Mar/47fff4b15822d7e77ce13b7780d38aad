Lauritta Onye, a 2016 Paralympic short put gold medalist, on Monday said she would need more support from the sports community and corporate organisations to be in top form for the 2020 Paralympics Games in Tokyo. Onye told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos that there was need for her to participate in various International Paralympics Committee (IPC) organised qualifiers for the games. She said lack of sponsorship had denied her the opportunity to take part in the Tokyo 2020 qualifiers held in 2018, adding that it was a dent on her target. “The authorities and I have our parts to play in the buildups to the games. “I believe have been living up to expectations, as I am keen on maintaining my record in the 2020 Paralympic Games. “I need to be participating in various IPC qualifiers holding across the globe to get me adequately prepared for the games proper, but I have not featured in any as of now. “Honestly, I am not happy with the situation of things but I have not allowed it to affect my training and commitment, being the reason I am keeping faith,” she said. The track and field two time world record holder in F-40 class called on individuals and corporate bodies to assist her, through sponsorship to enable her go for the 2019 qualifiers holding in Switzerland later in the year. According to her, it was necessary for the government to ensure that necessary buildup for the Tokyo 2020 Games were given priority, especially through participation in 2019 qualifiers.

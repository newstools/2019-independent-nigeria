The Ooni of Ife, Oba Enitan Ogunwusi, on Saturday said that another waterfall to be unveiled soon, had been discovered at the Ife Grand Resort, Ile-Ife. Ogunwusi disclosed this when the executives of the Nigeria Tour Operators (NATOP) visited him at his palace, adding that the land on which the resort was built was home to wild animals. He explained that the animals had, however, been appeased and had moved further into the bush to make the area safe for operations and tourism. According to him, in his quest to beautify the place and transform it into a world-class tourist site, a waterfall that beats human imagination was discovered and remodeled. “This is a mysterious waterfall that has just been discovered. It elicits about seven colours of water including red, blue, green and so on. “We are still doing some work on the site and when the project is completed, the whole world will marvel; and this is one of the things that will sell our country internationally. “The resort has been under construction for two years now; and when we are done, there will be nothing like it in the world,” he said. According to Ogunwusi, since he assumed the throne of his ancestors, he had made many discoveries that were beyond human imagination and beat world science. He described the discoveries as metaphysical things which truly attested to the myth that Ife was the cradle of mankind.

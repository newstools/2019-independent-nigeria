21 Savage just got a big break in his deportation case … the D.A. has rejected the felony case against him involving a concert promoter who claims he took $17,000 without performing. TMZ broke the story … 21 was booked to play a club gig in Southern Georgia back in 2016. He got the $17k but never performed — he wanted the singer who was up before him to get off the stage and, when the DJ refused, 21 bailed. The promoter got a warrant but never pursued it, until 21 was back in the news after getting arrested by ICE. She then went to the D.A. to jump-start her case.

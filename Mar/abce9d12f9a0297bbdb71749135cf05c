Abuja – Barely six days after the Saturday election, the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar; his running mate, Peter Obi, and the Director General of the PDP campaign and President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki, on Thursday met to strategise on the way forward. An insider told our correspondent that the meeting was about how to use the legal system to unseat President Muhammadu Buhari. Recall that Atiku, while addressing the nation on Wednesday, had said that he’s heading to court to challenge the outcome of Saturday’s election. Meanwhile, the former military Head of State and Chairman of the National Peace Committee, Gen. Abdusalami Abubakar; the Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Matthew Kukah, and other members of the National Peace Committee on Thursday met with Atiku. The meeting, which was held behind closed doors in Abuja, was convened following Atiku’s decision to go to court to challenge President Buhari’s victory. Speaking shortly after the meeting, Gen. Abdusalami Abubakar said the mission of committee is to douse the tension that is rising as an aftermath of the presidential election. Those at the meeting were Atiku’s running mate, Peter Obi; Senate President Bukola Saraki; PDP Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus; Speaker, Yakubu Dogara; and other PDP leaders. Also at the meeting was Cardinal John Onaiyekan, and Rev. Fr Atta Barkindo of the NPC secretariat.

Lagos – Super Falcons will play Slovakia in their second Group C game in the ongoing 2019 Cyprus Women’s Cup. Falcons lost their opening gamer 4-1 to Austria on Wednesday. In Cyprus, Nigeria is competing at the competition with three other France-bound teams – Italy, South Africa and Thailand, alongside Cyprus, Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, North Korea, Mexico and Slovakia. After today’s tie, the Super Falcons will play Belgium on Monday, March 4 while the competition ends on Wednesday, March 6. Meanwhile, Garba Lawal, member of the technical committee of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF),   has said that the team do not have any cause for alarm, in spite of their 4-1 loss to Austria. Rather than raise anxiety over the result, in which the Super Falcons failed to hold out till the final whistle, after their goalkeeper, Tochukwu Oluehi, was sent off in the fifth minute of play, Lawal said the squad will revive. “Any team will always want to win all their matches, and the same I know applies to the Super Falcons. “They lost this match, but they did not want to, but I am sure they have learnt something they can use at the World Cup. “This is still part of their preparations for the World Cup, and I know they will be ready for the competition in France. There is no cause for alarm.” In the same development, Oluehi has apologised for the red card and also rued the fact that she will miss today’s match against Slovakia. Oluehi went on to acknowledge the setback occasioned by her early dismissal, which came after she took down a goal bound opponent, as the Austrians tore through the Super Falcons’ defence. That affected the Falcons’ tactical and psychological balance, such that the side struggled to hold their own and barely managed to hold their own against the less fancied Austrians, who were immensely buoyed by their numerical advantage.

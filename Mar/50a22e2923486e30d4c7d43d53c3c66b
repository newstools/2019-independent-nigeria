UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet is sending an exploratory team to Venezuela in advance of her possible visit to the crisis-hit country. Following an invitation by the government of President Nicolas Maduro to High Commissioner Bachelet, a team from the UN Human Rights Office in Geneva will start a 12-day mission to talk to officials of the government and the opposition-dominated National Assembly. They will also try to meet civil society representatives and human rights abuse victims. “This is to ensure that the High Commissioner would be able to secure unfettered access to the people and places she would need to visit,’’ her office said in a statement. Bachelet said on Wednesday that Venezuela “clearly illustrates the way violations of civil and political rights, including failure to uphold fundamental freedoms, and the independence of key institutions, can accentuate a decline of economic and social rights.” She also pointed out that foreign sanctions have exacerbated the situation. Maduro, who won a second term in an election boycotted by most of the opposition in 2018, has presided over a massive economic crisis that has caused food and medicine shortages for large numbers of people and prompted millions to leave the country. The political crisis has escalated since January, when opposition leader and National Assembly President Juan Guaido declared himself interim president of the country.

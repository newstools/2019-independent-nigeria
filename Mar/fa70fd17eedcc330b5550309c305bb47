The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) says it regrets the omission ofthe All Progressives Congress (APC) from the list of parties on the result sheets for Saturday’s governorship and state houses of assembly elections in Zamfara State. This was contained in a statement signed by Rose Oriaran-Anthony, the INEC National Secretary, made available to NAN in Gusau, the Zamfara State capital, on Friday. The statement, with reference number INEC/SEC/265/Vol.ll/X and dated 8/3/2019, was circulated to chairmen of all political parties and other stakeholders in the state. INEC recalled its earlier compliance to a Zamfara High Court ruling marked ZMS/GS/52/2018, which ordered the commission to include APC on the ballot paper for all elections in the state which made it possible for the party to participate in the February 23 presidential and national assembly elections. The commission noted that it also included the party on ballot papers for the governorship and state legislative elections but regretted that the party was not on the result sheets. “The commission has just discovered that because of the suddenness of the court order, the party was omitted for the Governorship Result Sheets. This omission is deeply regretted. As a solution, the commission has decided to manually create columns in each of the Result Sheets after the last printed party, ZLP, and insert the APC. This does not affect any other information on the Result Sheets,” the statement read.

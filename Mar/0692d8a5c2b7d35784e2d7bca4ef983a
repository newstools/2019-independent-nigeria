U.S. President Donald Trump’s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort was sentenced to an additional 3 1/2 years in prison Wednesday for conspiracy linked to his lobbying efforts in Ukraine for a pro-Russian political party, adding to the nearly four-year term he was handed in a companion case last week. In failing health, the wheelchair-bound Manafort apologized to U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson in a Washington courtroom, saying he was ashamed of his actions and pleaded for mercy. “I am sorry for what I have done and for all the activities that have gotten us here today,” Manafort told the judge. “While I cannot undo the past, I will ensure that the future will be very different.” But Jackson told the 69-year-old Manafort she could not ignore his wrongdoing, telling him, “Saying I’m sorry I got caught is not an inspiring plea for leniency.” Jackson, who had revoked Manafort’s house arrest and jailed him last June after hearing allegations that he tampered with witnesses, imposed a 73-month sentence on Manafort. But she said 30 of the months would run concurrently with the 47-month term he was already sentenced for financial crimes. Together, the two sentences total 7 1/2 years, although Manafort will be given credit for the nine months he has already spent behind bars.

LAGOS – The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Lagos State, has refuted claim by some ad-hoc staff engaged by the commission for the purpose of the general elections that they have not been paid their allowances. The commission had, in a press statement made available to Daily Independent on Tuesday by the Lagos State Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the commission, Femi Akinbiyi, noted that no ad-hoc was being owed allowances. Akinbiyi stated that the commission’s attention was drawn to some report in the media that some ad-hoc staff who worked for the commission during the general elections had gone to some media houses to complain of nonpayment of their allowances. It refuted the allegation on the ground that it had paid every ad-hoc staff at the conclusion of each election, pointing out that those who claimed not to have received allowances could fall under the category of the people who had issues with their banks as a result of non-conformity with information they had in the bank details they submitted to the electoral body, and so the banks had returned their allowances to the commission. He, however, requested that those who had genuinely worked for the commission and had not been paid should liaise with the commission’s offices in their local government, even as he frowned at the protest led by one Samuel Nelson at Oshodi/Isolo local government INEC office. The PRO said, “It is unfortunate that Nelson should lead the protest because he worked for the commission and has been paid all his allowances even before the protest. “INEC will ensure that all those  who worked for it are paid their allowances and if there is anyone who worked for the commission and has not been paid, he or she should dialogue with the commission with a proof, instead of spreading falsehood through the media. They can also take advantage of SERVICOM unit of the commission to lay their claims through the following numbers: 09056369789 or 08145419483,” he said.

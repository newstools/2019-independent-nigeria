People clung to the outside rails of the Simon Bolivar Bridge to watch as President Ivan Duque and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo walked the same path taken by almost 4,000 Venezuelan refugees every day. The influx of refugees “has created a great social and economic shock,” Duque said, standing next to Pompeo in the muggy Colombian heat. “But as I always said, we are here to help the Venezuelan people who are running away from a brutal dictatorship.” One and a half million Venezuelans have fled across the border into Colombia in the last two years. Venezuelan refugees demonstrated as Pompeo visited with Duque over the weekend, chanting “libertad!” and anti-Maduro slogans. When asked what they wanted from the United States, the protesters yelled back: “intervention!” The Trump administration has consistently said that all options are on the table in its efforts to get Maduro to step down. He has been declared an illegitimate leader by the U.S. and dozens of other nations, which have thrown their support behind interim President Juan Guaido. But the White House has not given any public indication that a military intervention might be in the works, emphasizing instead diplomacy, sanctions and visa restrictions against the Maduro regime.

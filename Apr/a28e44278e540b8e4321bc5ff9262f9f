Lagos – Ahead of the African Boxing Union (ABU) lightweight title clash, Ghana’s Success Tetteh has vowed to be the first boxer to defeat Nigeria’s Oto Joseph, the reigning champion, when they meet at GOtv Boxing Night 18 on April 21. The bout will headline the event slated to hold at the Indoor Sports Hall of the Obafemi Awolowo Stadium (formerly Liberty Stadium) in Ibadan. Joe Boy, who also holds the Commonwealth (Africa) lightweight title, has remained undefeated in his 14-bout professional career. Speaking from his Accra base, the challenger said he is familiar with the champion’s strengths and weaknesses and is working on plans to neutralize him. “I’m very motivated to become the first boxer to defeat Joe Boy. I have watched him fight many opponents, who clearly did not know what to do in the ring. He will fall. It doesn’t matter that the fight is holding in Nigeria. I’m not named Success for nothing,” boasted Tetteh. In another international bout billed for the event, Nigeria’s Akeem Sadiku will take on Republic of Benin’s Ekpresso Djamihou in a light middleweight contest. Dodo, a cult figure among boxing fans in Ibadan, is a knockout expert. Also, six local bouts are lined up along the two international encounters, with the biggest being the national super featherweight title bout between Ridwan Oyekola and Taofeek Bisuga. Oyekola, a fast-rising boxer, won the best boxer award at GOtv Boxing Night 15 and defeated the vastly experienced Nurudeen Fatai at GOtv Boxing Night 17.

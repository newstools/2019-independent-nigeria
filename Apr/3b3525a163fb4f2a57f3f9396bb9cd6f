LAGOS – The Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN) has reiterated its support to government policy on the petroleum industry, including the policy on deregulation. The marketers said that the deregulation of the downstream sector remained the only way in achieving a robust and sustainable downstream petroleum industry in Nigeria. Mr. Adetunji Oyebanji, its Chairman, disclosed this in a communiqué issued yesterday in Lagos after the MOMAN Chief Executive Officers (CEO) Strategy Retreat, held in Abuja. The retreat focused on the way forward for the industry and sustainable and viable downstream sector. It would be recalled that the Federal Executive Council (FEC) had on July 19, 2017, approved the National Petroleum Policy (NPP), which articulates a vision for Nigeria to become a nation “where hydrocarbons are used as a fuel for national economic growth and not simply as a source of income.”

ESPN FC sources have said that Barcelona hope to bring in between €250 and €300 million in player sales this summer to balance the club’s accounts and be able to make signings without risking themselves financially,. Barca have already committed to paying an initial €75 million for Ajax midfielder Frenkie de Jong and are also weighing up moves for Matthijs de Ligt, Luka Jovic and even Antoine Griezmann ahead of what is expected to be a busy summer. However the club’s hierarchy are aware that to push through with their plans, players must leave first. There are two categories of players who could leave Camp Nou — those regularly linked with big money moves away — including Philippe Coutinho, Samuel Umtiti and Ivan Rakitic — and others who do not feature in coach Ernesto Valverde’s plans. ESPN FC revealed last month that Barca are ready to let Coutinho leave, just over a year after he became the club’s record signing, as long as they receive an offer over €100m. They paid Liverpool a fee which could rise to €160m last January for the Brazilian. Coutinho still has a good reputation in the Premier League despite his struggles in La Liga and Barca are already aware of several clubs interested in signing him.

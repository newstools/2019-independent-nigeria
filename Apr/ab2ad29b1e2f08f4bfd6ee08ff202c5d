Ibadan – A young man, Azeez Morufu, was on Tuesday allegedly caught withdrawing money from an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) belonging to one of the new generation banks located at Oba Adebimpe Road, Dugbe, Ibadan, without using a debit card. A passer-by was amazed seeing the ATM dispensing huge amount of money to Azeez without a debit card at the ATM point located beside the Ibadan national station of the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria (FRCN). Azeez ran out of luck when the bewildered passer-by raised the alarm and drew the attention of bank security personnel and others to the scene. FRCN Ibadan national station reported that the young man confessed that it was not the first time he would be carrying out the act. “Morufu said he has a code he always input on the ATM to dispense without a card,” FRCN further reported. Our correspondent gathered that Azeez had been handed over to the police.

LAGOS – Finidi George, former Super Eagles’ winger believes John Mikel Obi’s experience, the national team’s captain, would come handy to the team as they hunt for their fourth African Cup of Nations title which will kick off in Egypt in June. Consequently, the 1994 African Cup of Nations winner called on Coach Gernot Rohr to not only ensure the inclusion of the player in his squad but to also make best use of his experience. The former Ajax Amsterdam star said that the player’s experience would be of a huge advantage despite not featuring in some of the qualifiers. “I don’t know the situation concerning his availability, but he is a respected captain and if his current form is okay, then it’s a plus for the team. He doesn’t need to play all qualifiers for him to have the opportunity to join the team. “He could be with the team even if he doesn’t get 90 minutes in all games; he could just help them in team building because he is a player other colleagues respect and the young ones will learn from. “But as a coach you need to speak to him before the tournament and clarify his role in the tournament to avoid a possible burst up and if he agrees then for me it will be a massive boost for the country in Egypt,”Finidi told AOIFootball.com. Mikel last played for the Super Eagles in Nigeria’s 2-1 loss to Argentina at the 2018 World Cup in Russia. The 31-year-old former Chelsea star did not feature in any of the qualifiers as Nigeria returned to the continent after a six- year wait.

Emmanuel Fabiyi, the goalkeeper of Remo Stars, has expressed sadness at the current position of the Sky Blue in the topflight, assuring that they would continue to push against relegation, which is though a very daunting task, he noted. Remo Stars are last in Group A with 13 points from 15 games and certainly look like a sure candidate for relegation, more so as a whooping four clubs will be relegated from each of the two groups. But Fabiyi said that everything is possible and that they would sustain their fight to avoid the drop. “As long as the fight against relegation is concerned, we have a massive job in our hands and we will not relent because it is better that we tried and did not succeed than we failed to try at all. “Remo Stars are in deep challenge but we are not going to leave it there because everything is possible in this game,” he said. The Sky Blue will host another struggling side, Niger Tornadoes, in Ijebu Ode. The Ikon Allah Boys have seen their fortune nosedive this season which led to the sacking of their entire board last month. They are on the 11th spot on the log with the same 13 points as Remo Stars but with a -5 goals difference as against Remo’s -7.

LAGOS – The Anambra State Governor, Chief Willie Obiano has called on the Federal Government to grant the flag carrier status to Air Peace, rather than investing billions of naira in a planned state-owned national carrier for Nigeria. The governor also described Air Peace as the country’s fastest growing and most ambitious airline in history. This is as the National Union of Air Transport Employees (NUATE) has commended the airline for its bold move to acquire three wide-body aircraft, Boeing 777 for long-haul operations. The airline was also lauded for its excellent safety records since it commenced scheduled commercial flight operations in the Nigerian aviation industry in 2014. A statement by Mr. Chris Iwarah, spokesman for the airline said that in a congratulatory letter to the airline by the governor, he lauded the performance of the airline especially with the acquisition of its third B777 aircraft.

Mrs Angela Olarenwaju, IBEDC Head of Corporate Communications and Strategy,  in a statement in Osogbo said the three persons that were arraigned in an Osogbo Magistrates’ Court for allegedly committing the offence were not staff of the company. Some youths from Olomilagba and Bolorunduro communities in Ilesa had on March 14 stormed the Ilesa business hub of IBEDC in protest at  what they described as “crazy bills.’’ During the protest, the IBEDC management alleged that the protesting youths attacked its  staff ,destroyed its offices and made away with an unspecified amount of money. As a result of the attack, IBEDC disconnected electricity supply to the communities.

LAGOS – With the onset of its season of lack, plantain, a staple food majorly from Edo, Ondo and Ijebu Waterside appeared to be limited in supply, thereby, affecting the prices adversely. Consumers who are mostly affected unfavorably are diabetic patients as a large number of them prefer and depend on the commodity to stay healthy despite the fact that there are other meals to relish. But some of them have no option than to purchase the commodity irrespective of the price. Likewise, lovers of the staple food especially nursing mothers still patronize plantain because of its health benefits. The exorbitant prices have seen some traders reducing their normal purchases since they could no longer sustain it. The type of species seen in some of the markets visited could be discouraging to purchase because they could be mistaken for banana. Their sizes are small, expensive and to purchase the big ones requires spending more. During the week, visits to some markets across the states revealed that prices of the commodity soared by over 50 and 20 percent in few markets from February to April 12, 2019, a situation which many of the traders attributed to inadequate supply arising from scarcity and high demand. Checks at the Ogbeogologo Market, Asaba, showed that prices of plantain were at an upward trend especially when compared with what they were previously sold. For example, a big bunch of plantain that was earlier going for between N1,000 and N1,200 during the harvest period soared, currently ranging from N1,500 to N1,800.  This, however, depends on the bargaining power of the buyer. For the small bunch, it currently sells for between N800 and N1,000 as against 500 sold  before. Mrs. Regina Nwuche, who trades in the commodity at the Ogbeogologo Market, Asaba, in a chat with DAILY INDEPENDENT, connected the hike to seasonal factor. She said prices of the commodity are usually on the high side during the period of planting. The situation was not different from Ose Market, Onitsha, especially with the prices of six big bunches of plantain currently going for between N9,000 and N10,000 as against N7,000 formerly sold.  While that of the small bunch that previously attracted between N500 and N600 rose to N1,000. Many of the traders linked the increase to scarcity arising from limited supply. That of Oba Market, Benin City, the home of plantain, also witnessed an upsurge. For example, six bunches of small plantain that were earlier sold for N3,000 went up to the region of N4,500 and N5,000. Also, prices of a big bunch currently goes for between N1,500 and N1,700 up from N1,000 previously sold. Mrs. Awawu Emotan, a plantain seller at the Oba Market, Benin City, connected the situation to off-season effect and high demand. This is just as Mr. Salem of same market blamed the hike on inadequate supply. At the Wuse Market, Abuja, prices of  six  big bunches of plantain that were initially sold for between N9,000 and N9,500  skyrocketed and currently ranges  from N11,000 to N11,800, signifying a 22 or 24 percent rise. That of the small bunch soared to N800 from N500 formerly attracted. A plantain seller named Busari Ayinla at the Wuse Market; Abuja said that, non-availability was responsible for the hike. The same could be mentioned for Kings Market, Ado-Ekiti,  as prices of a big  bunch  of plantain which attracted between N800 and N1,000 rose by over 20 percent to between N1,300 and  N1,500 whereas  that of the small bunch sold earlier for between  N400 and N500 grew to  between N800 and N1,000. But this depends on the size of the plantain and the negotiating power of the customer.  A large proportion of the traders, however, blamed the rise on off-season effect, stressing that the level of patronage which seemed higher than the quantity supplied was also responsible. Also, in Lafenwa Market, Ogun State, scarcity, according to traders had hit the commodity, such that traders and particularly consumers had to sigh over the outrageous prices at which they are currently being sold for. More so, they are not adequately supplied. For instance, prices of a big bunch of plantain that were formerly sold for between N1000 and N1,200 increased to N1,500 while the small ones during the week attracted N800 as against N500 earlier sold. Many of the traders linked the situation to poor distribution which eventually led to scarcity. The trend for that of Bodija Market, Ibadan, was not conflicting from what was sold in other markets, especially with the prices of six small bunches going for between N4,000 and N4,500 as against between N2,500 and N3,000 initially sold during the period of bumper harvest. That of the big bunch currently ranges from N9,000 to N10,000 as  against between N6,000  and N7,500 depending on the size and haggling power of the buyer. Many of the traders connected the exorbitant prices to scarcity occasioned by seasonal factors. In Lagos, visits to popular Idi-Oro  and Ifesowapo Perishable markets indicated that prices of plantain were at an increasing trend especially with prices of a big bunch currently selling for between N1,500 and N2,000 as against between N1,000 and  N1,200 previously sold while that of the  small bunch escalated  to between N800 and N1,000 from N500  previously attracted. Mr. Gbenga Taiwo who trades in the commodity, at the Idi-Oro Market, Lagos, in a chat with our correspondent ascribed the hike principally to unavailability commonly associated with season of scarcity.

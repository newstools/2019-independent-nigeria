Politicians from Delta south and central senatorial districts have been cautioned not to heat up the polity or divert the attention of the incumbent governor and winner of the just concluded governorship election in the state, Dr Ifeanyi Okowa, from his prosperity agenda for Deltans. Making the appeal on Tuesday, Chief Sunny Onuesoke, the Special Project Director to the governor, who spoke with journalists in Warri, said it was too premature to bring to the political arena who or which tribe takes over from Okowa in 2023, stressing further that issues that would disturb the state governor from performing than what he did in his first four years shouldn’t be brought to the table. According to him, “I am against zoning; I am against the issue of federal character because it brings mediocrity. I don’t support federal character because what is generating this conflict today is the federal character mentality”. Onuesoke, who is from Delta central said “the idea of bringing up Urhobo, Ijaw, Isoko; is rubbish. It is a retrogressive ideology. The governor has good four years and that is 48 months and that is a lot of time for the governor to do things”, saying the call for an Ijaw or Urhobo governor was untimely. “I just want to sound a caution to politicians from Delta central and south to beware of such advocacy because it is retrogressive, and diversionary. It’s going to disturb the able governor from concentrating on the lofty projects he has for the good people of Delta in his second term”.

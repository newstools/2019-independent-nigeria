Hon. Kolawole Taiwo (HKT), a former Deputy Speaker of the Lagos state Assembly speaks on why he wants to represent Ajeromi Federal constituency in the House of Representatives, litigations and his hope on the supplementary election. TEMIDAYO AKINSUYI brings the excerpts: What is the state of things with litigation hindering the conduct of the supplementary election? I think that is where we have gotten ourselves to after the March election. INEC declared the election inconclusive and we were all looking forward to the rerun that would come up on the 9th of April. Suddenly, my opponent in PDP went to court and said she has won. I was shocked because we have an umpire supervising and conducting the election who said this is where we are, that we still have 43,660 votes outside and they said she had 31,000 + votes while I had 28,000+ so we had the difference of 3,224 votes and they now said we will need to do supplementary election in those areas with problems, I feel when she heard that she realised it would be very difficult for her to win me because most of the areas in contention are our own stronghold. We have about 71 booths, though some of her own area are also there, she threw caution to the wind and went to a court in Abuja using all the connections in the House of Reps because I was told that the Speaker Rt.Hon Yakubu Dogara was like a pillar behind her, it’s Dogara that now want to tell us in Ajegunle who should represent us I just wonder, they took the case to a court in Kubwa not even in Abuja business district court but far away in Kubwa,Buari judicial district, we went there I was not afraid and the INEC lawyer said the court has no jurisdiction to hear the case,my lawyer said we should not bother ourselves with jurisdiction  we should rather answer it because when you have an exparte injunction according to my leaders explanations it implies that you are called upon to afford the court with some information and we told them what INEC gave us because they actually called a stakeholder meeting, to announce the inconclusiveness of the election, I was however shocked when I saw her complain that INEC did not declare the result before saying we should go for a rerun, that is not true because INEC did call us for a stakeholders meeting but the PDP did not show up that is where they told us that this is the  scores of PDP, that of the APC and this is the difference and they cited the electoral act that says if the difference between the first and second is not up to the cancelled results then there supposed to be a rerun and we still had over 43,660 votes outside in 71 booths, but in the wisdom of the judge though we quoted that in our reply, INEC as the umpire are the ones that are even supposed to provide the figures but the INEC said the court doesn’t have jurisdiction and the judge assumed jurisdiction on the day of judgment and now said INEC should go and release the result of the collated areas and now tell the world what the situation is. That is where we are. The instruction of the judge is for INEC to do certain things and we are looking at their direction, I know any moment from now they would call us for a stakeholders meeting and would now do what INEC suggested, but they have done it ,our party was there it was covered and shown to me. Hope INEC would not go ahead and declare your opponent winner because there are some areas where such happens and INEC still do that. Don’t you see such scenario repeating itself here? INEC has spoken now and I don’t expect INEC to change their position on that, INEC initially called us to a stakeholders parley briefing  us about the situation on ground asking us to prepare for rerun which we were ready for even on the governorship election on the  9th of March we have started voting when we suddenly had to stop due to an order INEC in Abuja signaled they had stopping us from holding the rerun, I think she took it to National Headquarters of INEC claiming she has an ex parte injunction and you know INEC would not want to do that with the knowledge of court injunction, they have done it in several situations, like in Bauchi where an exparte injunction made them schedule it for another day, same goes for Adamawa and other rerun held but that does not stop INEC from doing what it needs to do because the judge said the court doesn’t have power to stop INEC from doing whatever it needs to do, that was part of the judgment. I have been working and I have been talking to people, I am aware that when you are facing election you need do a lot of campaigns like I had done in the past people even commended me that the way I have put myself into this is more than my previous elections and I said yes I don’t want to lose but win, and the only way you can win is by talking to people to let them know why they should give you their votes and not an alternative, I am a strictly law abiding citizen and don’t take short cuts to victory. What is your assessment of what used to be your political dynasty in Ajeromi and the paradigm shift there now? I wouldn’t want to wash our dirty linens outside, but I know there are interference that caused some of the weaknesses in our party because before now, I know what I did in preparing our people for governorship election, but some people just felt you are below them and they are making a costly mistake too which caused a lot of problems. It is really not for discussion today I pray there would be lots of time for me to write the story but now, I am looking forward to being elected, I would not want to say something that would jeopardise my chances and let people decide otherwise. Even there would be a day I would write a book about my life, I have spent a lot of time in public life that I must sit down and write a book for myself not asking people to write on my behalf because there is nothing somebody can say that would match what you want to say. I have seen a lot and need to talk for others coming behind to take cue and get some assistance for future, I know I am getting to the end of this career and I have not fared badly,I have put so much into politics than anybody can ever imagine, until I am able to come out and tell them before they can be able to see what I have done.

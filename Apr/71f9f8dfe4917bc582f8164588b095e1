Lagos – In what is obviously a vote of no confidence in the Nigerian referees, the Confederation of African Football (CAF) has once again snubbed them on the roaster for the forthcoming Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt. In a release of the list of referees for the 24-team event, no Nigerian referee was included. Twenty seven referees selected for the tournament, even as countries as Burundi, Mali, Zambia and Sudan were represented on the list, no Nigerian referee was selected for the big occasions. However, only one assistant referee from Nigeria, Baba Adel, was listed among the 29 assistant referees selected. The tournament will in Egypt from June 21 to 19 July 19, 2019, in line with the decision of the CAF Executive Committee on July 20, 2017 to move the tournament from January/February to June/July for the first time. Meanwhile, instances abound in the past when Nigerian referees were ignored in major competitions. In fact for so many years now spanning several African Cup of Nations, no Nigerian referee has officiated a match, raising big questions on the credibility of the whistle men in the country.

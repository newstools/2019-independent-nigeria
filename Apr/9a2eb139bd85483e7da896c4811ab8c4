Despite losing 0-2 to FC IfeanyiUbah last weekend, Coach Willy Udube has expressed happiness at the Go Round FC’s season and how it has been going down, drawing his strength from the club’s resilience despite coming against some of the league’s big players with heavy financial muscle. Despite only missing out on a place in the relegation zone last season by the whiskers, the Omoku-based side have been turning heads in their second season in the elite division and Udube is thrilled that his inexperienced side is coping in the elite division. He noted that it has not been easy for him and the rest of the technical crew to ensure that the club remains very competitive amidst experienced clubs in the top-flight who have the financial power to spend big in the transfer market. “The games are tough, but this is the case because we have a young and inexperienced team,” Udube told the club media. “I have said it before and I will continue to say it that I have a very average team. Go Round FC is a modest club that does not have the financial power to bring in experienced players to the team. “All this time, we have been trying to see how we can blend the players we have. It is not easy for us. It is a very big job for us, but I strongly believe that with the little we are putting in, this team will pick up before the middle of the FA Cup.” Go Round are presently in seventh on the log with 21 points from 15 matches.

Lagos – As the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released Nigeria’s inflation report for the month of March 2019 on Tuesday, financial analysts and economists say the development is an indication that there will be enough reason for the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to reduce MPC rates by the middle of the year. The NBS report showed that the rate of increase in general price level edged southwards to 11.25 percent – down by 5bps from the 11.31 percent recorded in February, 2019. Additionally, on a month-on-month (m/m) basis, headline inflation index rose 6bps to 0.79 percent. Notably, the marginal moderation in the headline rate was buoyed by twin declines in both the core (down 34bps to 9.5%). “This is 0.06 percent points lower than the rate recorded in February 2019 (11.31 percent). Increases were recorded in all COICOP divisions that yielded the Headline index. “On month-on-month basis, the headline index increased by 0.79 percent in March 2019, this is 0.06 percent rate higher than the rate recorded in February 2019 (0.73) percent,” the report said. The NBS added that the percentage change in the average composite CPI for the twelve months period ending March 2019 over the average of the CPI for the previous twelve months period was 11.40 percent, showing 0.16 percent point from 11.56 percent recorded in February 2019. The report stated that urban inflation rate increased by 11.54 percent year-on-year in March 2019 from 11.59 percent recorded in February, while the rural inflation rate increased by 10.99 percent in March from 11.05 percent in February. On a month-on-month basis, the NBS said the urban index rose by 0.81 percent in March, up by 0.05 percentage points from 0.76 percent recorded in February. It added that the rural index also rose by 0.77 percent in March, up by 0.06 percentage points from the 0.71 percent recorded in February. The report stated that food index rose by 13.45 percent in March compared to 13.47 percent in February. It said the rise in the food index was caused by increases in prices of bread and cereals, meat, fish, potatoes, yam and other tubers, oils and fats, and soft drinks, vegetables, and fruits. In terms of state inflation profile, the report said price increases were highest in Kebbi (14.65 percent), Zamfara (13.15 percent) and Taraba (12.98 percent), while Kwara (9.84 percent), Cross River (9.66 percent) and Delta (9.61 percent) recorded the slowest rise in headline year-on-year inflation. On a month on month basis, however, it said inflation was highest in Kogi (1.91 percent), Plateau (1.77 percent), and Lagos (1.63 percent), while Nasarawa (0.26 percent), Kwara (0.16 percent) and Enugu (0.13 percent) recorded the slowest rise. Lukman Otunuga, FXTM Research Analyst, said: “With consumer prices moderating closer towards the Central Bank of Nigeria’s target band of 6%-9%, this may open the doors for the central bank to make a move in the future. “While it remains premature to speculate on the possibility of another rate cut occurring anytime soon following the surprise move in March, repeated signs of easing inflationary pressures could prompt the CBN to cut rates again during the second half of 2019.” For Cyril Ampka, an Abuja-based economist, the country should take advantage of the favourable inflation figures to adjust rate without hesitating. “I think this is the right time to do anything significant. The CBN should look at the possibility of reducing benchmark rate,” Ampka said. On their part, analysts at Cordros Capital said: “Looking ahead, we expect inflation to remain sticky in the 11.0 percent region, barring the materialisation of any major trigger – minimum wage implementation and/or a hike in energy tariffs among others. “Furthermore, although the recent cut in the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) should, in ordinary economic theory, awaken some inflationary pressure, the CBN’s continued OMO mop-ups and FX interventions should keep liquidity largely constrained.”

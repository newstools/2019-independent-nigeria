LAGOS – Lagos State House of Assembly on Tuesday urged the the federal government to order Eko Electricity Distribution Company(EEDC) and Ikeja Electric to phase out estimated electricity billing and provide prepaid meters to residents of the state. The lawmakers also urged the Minister of Power, Works and Housing, Babatunde Raji Fashola, to order Eko and Ikeja Distribution Companies (DISCOs) to phase out metering system and provide pre-paid meters to residents of the state. The lawmakers also implored the National Assembly to expedite action on the passage of the Electricity Reform Act 2018.Their request was sequel to a motion moved by some lawmakers in the House of Assembly led by Tunde Braimoh(Kosofe Constituency 11), who urged the National Assembly to expedite action on the Electricity Power Reform Act 2018, which criminalises the estimated billing system. “The House calls on the Minister of Power and the National Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) to call on Eko and Ikeja DISCOs to desist from taking transformers away from consumers over non-payment of bills.The minister and NERC should ensure the distribution of prepaid meters to consumers and the Consumer Protection Agency should ensure that the rights of consumers in Lagos State are protected. “The House resolves to call on the National Assembly to amend Schedule Two of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to allow states and local governments generate electricity.The National Assembly should expedite action on the Electricity Reform Act 2018,’’he added Mudashiru Obasa, the House Speaker, stressed the need for the federal government to allow states or local governments, which can generate electricity, to do so.He noted that concentrating electricity generation in the hands of the Federal Government alone, when there are no resources to do so, is wrong.

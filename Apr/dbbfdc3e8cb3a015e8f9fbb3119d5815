Organisers of the maiden Lagos Media Marathon have made an official announcement; seeking for volunteers for the upcoming media race slated for May. Debo Oshundun the vice chairman of the organising committee for the media marathon said on Tuesday that more hands are needed to help midwife the historic event. Oshundun said volunteers are needed in some key aspects that would further help with a seamless organisation. The aspects in which volunteers are being expected include medical, transportation, steward, welfare, logistics and technical. â€œWe are asking for interested volunteers to come on board in this historic journey that would be placing Lagos and indeed Nigeria in the history books as far as road races and sports is concerned in Africa.

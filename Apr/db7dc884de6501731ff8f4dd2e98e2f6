OSOGBO – Dr. Olapade Agoro, National Chairman of National Action Council (NAC), has lamented the spate of banditry and insecurity of lives in parts of the country, saying it is high time the menace is addressed nationally. Agoro, in a statement issued o Tuesday, said the menace had posed serious concerns to the generality of the people, adding that it must be addressed nationally if the current government was eally desirous to attract foreign investors for development. He emphasised that if the international community must take the well intentioned and well-meaning invitation of President Muhammadu Buhari to come over to Nigeria to invest, there must be guaranteed peace in the country. Agoro maintained that there must be no threat to lives and property if the country wished to develop and attract foreign investors. He said: “It becomes pertinent to say that the concern loudly raised recently by President Muhammadu Buhari,  through his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, on the damning issues of security threat to lives and property, kidnappings  and banditry rampaging the nooks and corners of the country, must be seen by all and sundry as a call on the need and necessity to quickly stem in the bud the threat of self annihilation confronting the nation.”

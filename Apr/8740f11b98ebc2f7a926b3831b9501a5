LAGOS – After pounding a first di- vision club from Iceland (UMFSelfoss)6-1onFriday, Nigeria’s Super Falcons face a more worthwhile test when they square up to their Canadian counter- parts in a friendly match in the city of Murcia, Spain on Monday (today). Following earlier tests against teams like China and Belgium in the run up to the 8th FIFA Women’s World Cup finals in France this summer, the nine –time African champions will be able to truly measure their progress against the Cana- dians, who have promised to field their full strength ontheday. Both countries began talks for this encounter during the draw ceremony of the FIFA World Cup in France in December last year. On Monday, coaches Thomas Dennerby and Kenneth Heiner-Møller will send out their strongest squads on the turf of Pina- tar Stadium for a real test, two months before the big showpiece begins in France. Kenneth Heiner-Møller has made it known he val- ues the encounter with the African champions, as it would enable him to antici-pate what to expect against the Indomitable Lionesses of Cameroon, whom Can- ada tackles in their first match of the 8th FIFA Women’s World Cup finals in Montpellier on June 10. The North Americans will also play New Zealand and The Netherlands in the group phase. On their part, the Falcons will open their campaign against Norway in Reims two days earlier. Nigeria will also confront Korea Republic in Grenoble on June 12, before taking on tournament hosts France in Rennes on June 17. Nigeria and Canada have locked horns twice at the FIFA Women’s World Cup finals. On June 8, 1995, at the Olympic Stadium in Hel- singborg, Norway, the Super Falcons came from behind to tie their group phase en- counter 3-3.

Comrade Timi Frank, a political activist and ally of former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, has said that the Presidency has finally been caught in what he described as ‘Freudian slip’ following revelations by the Personal Assistant to the President Muhammadu Buhari on Social Media, Lauretta Onochie, and the President’s campaign spokesman, Festus Keyamo, regarding their principal and Walter Onnoghen, the former Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN). Frank said that unconsciously the statement credited to Onochie that Justice Walter Onnoghen had a plan to judicially annul the February 23, 2019 Presidential Election and hand over a default victory to the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, “is an admission and a corroboration of what we have always known – that the persecution of Justice Walter Onnoghen was politically motivated and was not done in good faith.” He said that the assault on an innocent man, Onnoghen, by the Buhari administration was geared toward thwarting the will of the Nigerian people. While reacting to both Festus Kayamo and Lauretta Onochie’s statements, through a statement signed Monday in Abuja, Frank recalled that on Monday, April 15, 2019, the President’s aide on Social Media said that “Atiku’s plan was for Justice Onnoghen to annul the results of 17 major states won by President Buhari, thereby giving victory to you guess who, yes, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar. But Justice Onnoghen confessed to crimes against our nation.” Frank said the above statement is a prima facie evidence that the Buhari government never planned to hold credible elections and that it was using the state to sponsor an attack on the judiciary in order to cow the learned justices into giving a judgment favourable to President Buhari. He said, “Nigerians may recall that the petition used to suspend Justice Onnoghen was written by one Dennis Aghanya, who is a former spokesman to President Buhari and currently one of his confidantes. Nigerians may further recall that the Code of Conduct Bureau received the petition on Saturday, January 12, 2019, which is normally a day that the judiciary does not function. “It would further be recalled that the Code of Conduct Bureau acted on the matter on Monday, January 14, 2019 and that never in the history of the Code of Conduct Bureau has a petition been given such breathtaking accelerated speed to the extent that the Code of Conduct Tribunal admitted that it had not finished investigating the case before it charged Justice Onnoghen before the Code of Conduct Tribunal.”

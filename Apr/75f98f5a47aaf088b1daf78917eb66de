LAGOS – Nigeria recorded a 36 percent drop in reported piracy incidents at sea in the first quarter of 2019, according to the International Maritime Bureau (IMB) Piracy Reporting Centre. The report revealed that the country recorded 14 incidents of piracy in the first quarter of this year compared to 22 incidents reported in the first quarter of 2018.It attributed the decline to the increased effort of the Nigerian Navy to actively respond to reported incidents by dispatching patrol boats. But, Nigerian waters remain risky for vessels, especially the port of Lagos where four incidents have been reported, despite the efforts of the navy. IMB said global piracy and armed robbery incidents decreased 42.4 percent in the review period with 38 incidents as against 66 incidents recorded in the corresponding period last year.It added that 27 vessels were boarded, seven vessels were fired upon and four attempted attacks occurred in the first quarter of 2019.

A man has been arrested by police investigating the racist abuse of Wigan footballer Nathan Byrne on Twitter. The incident was one of two allegations of racist abuse aimed at Championship players on Saturday. Wigan said they were “angered” by an abusive message sent to the defender on Twitter following a 2-2 draw with Bristol City. A 20-year-old man from Sheffield handed himself in at a police station in Blackpool on Saturday. Liverpool Hope University said it believed the man was one of its students and was investigating the incident urgently. He was questioned on suspicion of committing a racially aggravated public order offence and malicious communications and released pending further investigation. The English Football League said it was “saddened, disappointed and angered to hear of further reports of alleged racism”. A file has been passed to the Crown Prosecution Service.

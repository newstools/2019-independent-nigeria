Manchester United’s Champions League heroics in Paris will be playing on Barcelona’s minds in the Nou Camp next week, according to Paul Pogba. United need a European miracle to progress against the La Liga leaders having lost the first leg 1-0 at Old Trafford, but it’s only just over a month since they found one to reach this stage of the competition. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side’s European adventure looked to be over when Paris Saint-Germain won 2-0 at Old Trafford in the first leg of their last-16 tie, but United became the first team in the competition’s history to overturn a defeat by two more or goals at home in the first leg, winning 3-1 at the Parc des Princes. That astonishing comeback will give United belief they can pull off the impossible once again next Tuesday night, and Pogba insists it will be preying on Barcelona as well as they look to hold on to their advantage. “We are 1-0 down and now go to the Nou Camp but we believe chances will come over there,” the 26-year-old said. “We have to keep believing. It is a Champions League game and we know we can hurt them as well as they can hurt us.

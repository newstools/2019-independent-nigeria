The second Africa Blue Economy Forum (ABEF) will take place on 25-26 June 2019 in Tunis, Tunisia. The annual event, ABEF said would bring together over 150 delegates from across the globe, including ocean experts and innovators, African political leaders and policy makers, international entrepreneurs and investors, as well as NGOs and multilaterals, to discuss the great potential of the blue economy to drive sustainable growth in Africa. Last year, during the forum’s inauguration, speakers and delegates at ABEF2018 agreed on the need for innovative financing to start developing Africa’s blue economy on a wider scale, involving not only governments but also the private sector. Building on these recommendations, ABEF2019 will have a strong focus on business and investment. Discussions will explore the opportunities and innovations in emerging and frontier sectors of the blue economy and how they can help accelerate Africa’s transformation. Africa’s maritime industry is estimated at around $1trn per year and the asset value of ocean economy ecosystems around $24trn.

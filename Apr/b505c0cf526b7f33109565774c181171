The United States and China are in a virtual deadlock in the race for 5G, or fifth-generation wireless networks expected to unlock new services, an industry survey showed Tuesday. The report shows the United States has closed the gap with China in “readiness” for the ultrafast wireless systems and has more 5G deployments planned in 2019 than any other country. The study for the wireless industry group CTIA and conducted by the research firm Analysys Mason showed the US moved ahead of South Korea in 5G readiness over the past year to a virtual tie with China, as a result of considerable investment in 5G systems. CTIA president Meredith Attwell Baker said in a statement that the United States has made “impressive strides” in preparing for the new technology but that more is needed to maintain leadership. “We can’t be complacent as the 5G race has really just begun,” she said.

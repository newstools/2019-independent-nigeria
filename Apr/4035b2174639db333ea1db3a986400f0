Mrs. Bella Disu, Executive Vice Chairman (EVC) of Globacom, has lauded African Voices, for being a trail blazer in the bid to close the communication gap on the continent. This, the magazine programme of the Cable News Network has done by featuring people across different sectors, including budding entrepreneurs like Ethiopia’s Abai Schulze and legends like the late Chinua Achebe among other outstanding Africans. Disu made the remarks during  a cocktail organised by the International News Agency  in commemoration of a decade of broadcasting African Voices over the weekend at  the Eko Hotels and Suites in Lagos. While  expressing  the hope that the programme would continue to be a platform for a mutually-beneficial partnership for many more years, she enjoined all Africans to play their part in building the continent’s future, adding that the partnership with CNN African Voices had allowed Globacom to extend its impact in a unique way. Globacom is the exclusive sponsor of the programme on CNN since 2010 and has over the years contributed robustly towards changing the paradigm in the world information order.

Residents of Kano have been thrown into palpable fear as unconfirmed news of possible scarcity of Petroleum Motor Spirit (PMS) known as petrol hit the state. The situation has further been compounded on Monday following the reluctance of some marketers to dispense petrol, in anticipation of a new pump price regime. A surveillance of some council areas showed that most of the filling stations had remained closed since last week when the rumour of the price hike filtered into the state. There are reports that filling stations owned by the Independent Petroleum Marketers preferred to sell products to black marketers in an attempt to maximise profit. This is coming in spite the warning by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) that the Federal Government has not increased the price. A resident of Gwarzo LGA, Alhaji Danbala Gwarzo confirmed to newsmen that none of the seven filling stations in the town opened for business on Monday. According to him, motorists in the state have resorted to buying the commodity from black marketers, due to the closure of the filling stations in the town. “We have no fewer than seven filling stations, but as I am talking to you now, none of the filling stations is operating despite the fact that they have the product in the store. “But the moment you go beyond Gwarzo town, you will see filling stations selling the product at the government-approved price of N145 per litre,” he said.

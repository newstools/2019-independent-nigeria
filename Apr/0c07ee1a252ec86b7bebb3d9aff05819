UGHELLI – The Egbema and Gbaramatu Communities Development Foundation (EGCDF) has congratulated former Niger Delta freedom fighter, High Chief Government Ekpemupolo, popularly known as Tompolo, on his 48th birthday. Ambassador Jude Ebitimi Ukori, EGCDF Executive Chairman, in a statement on behalf of the foundation, said Tompolo’s contribution to the struggle to emancipate the Ijaw people from the oppressive leadership of the Nigeria government resulting to an Ijaw man, Dr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, becoming the nation’s first minority president. “He attracted the Nigeria Maritime University. His persistent struggle brought about Amnesty programme. So many of our young ones who would not have gone to university are now graduates. That is because Tompolo stood his ground to make what is wrong, right. “The man is always standing for what is right, which is justice for his people. That’s why he is being persecuted by the Nigerian government. By God’s grace, he will be vindicated. We will celebrate him every year. Our prayer is that God will continue to guide and protect him. By the grace of God, we will celebrate him at 100. For us, he is a living legend,” the statement added. It further described Tompolo as an illustrious Ijaw son with passion to emancipate the Niger Delta region, particularly the Ijaw nation, from continuous oppression of the Nigeria state, adding, “As a leader, he has done greatly in helping the Ijaw nation in advancing the course of good governance across the region.” While pleading with the Federal Government to drop all charges against him, EGCDF prayed God to richly bless him as he continued to contribute his quota to the development of Niger Delta.

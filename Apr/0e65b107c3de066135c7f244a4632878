Lagos – Paul Put, Syli Nationale of Guinea coach, has expressed awe for the quality of the Nigerian squad his side will play in Group B of this year’s Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), as he said that the Super Eagles are a great team and will be difficult for his team. Reacting to the Friday’s draw of the AFCON 2019 competition which pitched his team with Nigeria in Group B, the former Harambee Stars of Kenya handler believes that the players would give a good account of themselves. ”I am perhaps happy with this draw, but it is not an easy draw I admit, we must be very careful because Nigeria is a great team but it’s good for us too. “We will do everything to move to the second round. We will have to work very well and respect all the other teams that make up our group,” he said. Put will be aiming for revenge against the Super Eagles of Nigeria in their second group match on June 26 at the Alexandria Stadium, as he was also the coach for Burkina Faso when they lost to Nigeria in the final of the 2013 AFCON in South Africa. He will now have to bank on Liverpool’s Naby Keïta and Napoli’s Amadou Diawara to help him overcome the three-time champions in Alexandria, Egypt, ahead of which he said he fancies Guinea’s chances of reaching the round of 16 of the 2019 AFCON. At Friday’s draw in Cairo, Nigeria, Guinea, Madagascar and Burundi were pitched together in Group B with the first two teams automatically qualifying for the second stage of the competition.

Mrs. Belinda Faniyi, the Ogun State Coordinator of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), has commended the support extended to the scheme by the state government and other stakeholders. Faniyi spoke, while receiving Major-General Suleiman Kazaure, the NYSC Director-General, who was on a national tour of the 2019 Batch ‘A’ orientation training exercise across the country. She informed the visitor about the ongoing construction of a clinic sponsored by Chief Kunle Soname, Chairman, Beta Niger Limited. Faniyi also informed the DG that the state government had been briefed on the inadequate accommodation for corps members and officials, just as the secretariat had commenced the construction of a 100-capacity hostel to address the challenges. The DG, represented by Abdul-Rasheed Sanusi, Acting Director, Corps Welfare and Inspectorate at the headquarters office, Abuja, in his address cautioned corps members against embarking on wild adventures and dangerous excursions, adding that unfortunate incidences resulting from such excesses had led to the death of many of them in the past. The DG, who recalled the unfortunate adventure that led to the death of nine corps to Taraba State in 2018, said that such would not be allowed to occur again, adding that roads were bad, just as its users had been reckless. Sanusi, who took a tour of the camp and hostel facilities commended Faniyi for maintaining a cleaner environment and rated the camp far above average in all areas.

The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has beefed up Super Falcons’ bench for the forthcoming 8th FIFA Women’s World Cup in France with the inclusion of Per Harlsson and Matti Demegard. The boosting of the team’s technical crew ahead of the finals is aimed at giving the team the desired personnel needed to aid their preparation for the tournament. Harlsson has been brought on board as conditioning coach, while Demegard will work as video analyst. Both were recommended by Head Coach Thomas Dennerby. Explaining the relevance of the new staff to the team, Dennerby said: “The analyst collects clips on players, processes them and the players can come to the analyst a day after the game to see the different situations they were into. We also do it on team base so that we can see defending line, midfield, build up play, finishing and so on. This is very important for the education of the players and technical understanding. “Then we have the conditioning coach who is building the endurance of players as well as speed muscles. His role is to help our players to get quicker and better stamina. He is also a really important part of the team.” The team had taken part in two preparatory tournaments in China and Cyprus, an ongoing one in Spain. They will participate in the WAFU B Tournament and final camping programme in the world Avita Resort in Austria, making the Class of 2019 perhaps the most –prepared Super Falcons for any FIFA World Cup finals since the competition was launched 28 years ago.

Zack Amodu, director of organisation for the road race told the media that the hotel joined the race because of its pace-setting role in getting international recognition for a road race. “We are delighted to have this respected and highly successful Nigerian join us as we continue to put the country’s name on the world map as a safe place and a destination for sports,” said Amodu who revealed that  captain Okunbo has registered as a celebrity runner for this year’s race. He further revealed that  Pamodzi Sports Marketing, organisers of the race want to use the seventh edition to benchmark subsequent editions as they move to get the first and only IAAF Silver Label race in West Africa upgraded to a gold label event and become in the process the first in the sub-region and second in the continent of Africa after the Sanlam Cape Town Marathon in South Africa. “We are organising an IAAF Gold Label race this year albeit the Okpekpe international 10km road race status is still silver. This is because the IAAF have changed the method of application for a label race.The international governing body for the sport wants application for the desired label at least two months before the race. What this means is that requirements for the label you are applying for must be the template for the preceding race.’ The Wells Carlton Hotel and Luxury Apartments, a five-star luxury hospitality icon in Abuja has signed in as the official hotel for the seventh Okpekpe international 10km road race.

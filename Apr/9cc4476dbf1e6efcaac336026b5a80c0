Embattled Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Walter Onnoghen, will on April 15, know the date judgment in his on going trial at the Code of Conduct Tribunal will be delivered. Onnoghen is being prosecuted by the Federal Government on a 6-count charge of false and non-declaration of assets.
The development was sequel to the sudden closure of his case at the tribunal by his lawyer. Having closed his case after calling one witness, Onnoghen’s counsel at Wednesday’s proceeding, Chris Uche SAN, informed the CCT Chairman Danladi Umar of the defendant’s intention not to call another witness. In view of the development, the tribunal has given the prosecution and defence counsel 3 days each to file their final written addresses. The tribunal further directed that the addresses would be finally adopted on April 15, after which the judgment date will be fixed.

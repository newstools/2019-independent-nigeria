Mountain of Fire and Mira- cles Ministries FC will now focus on the Federation Cup, so says the club Media Officer, Olawale Quadri. Quadri, who spoke with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos on Wednesday said that the current excellent run of the team in the abridged 2018/2019 Nigeria ProfessionalFootballLeague (NPFL) would be nothing if not replicated in the FA Cup. Quadri said that though the club had dominated the Lagos State FA Cup in the last four years, the club was yet to have the desired campaign in the national FA challenge, which they sought to address. Quadri said that MFMâ€™s good run in the league would amount to nothing if the team failed to transfer it to the oldest cup competition in the country.

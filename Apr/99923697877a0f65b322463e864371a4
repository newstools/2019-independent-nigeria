Umuahia – The Abia State Council of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) has called on the state Environmental Protection Agency to improve on her services and sustain carting away of refuse items within Umuahia, the state capital, in order to keep the capital city clean save it from Lassa fever epidemic. The NUJ state council made the call in an eight-point communiqué issued at the end of its congress for the month of March. Jointly signed by the state NUJ chairman, John Emejorn and the secretary, Victor Ndukwe, the pen pushers further called on health workers in the state to begin house-to-house sensitisation on the need for residents to keep their environment clean to ward off outbreak of the dreaded Lassa fever currently ravaging some parts of the country. The state NUJ council used the forum to felicitate with Governor Okezie Ikpeazu on his victory in the last governorship election while urging him to consolidate on the gains made in his first term so as to continue to develop the state and, as well, deliver the dividends of democracy to Abians. It further commended the national president of NUJ, Chris Isiguzo, for bringing finesse to the administration of the union since he assumed office and for his recent visit to President Muhammadu Buhari.

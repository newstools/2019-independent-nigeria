The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Labour and Employment, Mr. William Alo has stated that the Federal Government is committed to the promotion of decent work environment in line with the provisions of the International Labour Organisation (ILO). Alo made the declaration in Abuja yesterday when he received the National Women Commission of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), led by Comrade Mercy Okezie. He said Nigeria had always eschewed all forms of discrimination and negative attitudes in the workplace, had adequate laws forestalling such practices, and had always keyed into the International Labour Organisation’s (ILO) provisions. According to him, “Nigeria is ready, willing and determined to show more commitment to making the work environment conducive for every Nigerian worker. “If the work environment is conducive, friendly, accommodating and protective, it brings peace, love and understanding. So, the advocacy is timely because we need to do more.” He pledged the commitment of government to supporting the ILO Convention on Stopping Gender-based Violence and Harassment of Women and Men in the World of Work, emphasising the relationship between an enabling work environment, productivity, and economic growth. Alo congratulated Nigerian workers and NLC in particular, for their effort in negotiating for the new National Minimum Wage, saying “the Nigerian government is determined to ensuring that the average Nigerian worker is happy.” The Permanent Secretary appreciated the NLC as a credible ally to the Ministry on labour issues – all geared towards making the Nigerian workers happy. Earlier, Okezie, said the commission was on an advocacy visit to the ministry to solicit support for the adoption of the ILO Convention on violence and harassment in the workplace. She requested for the adoption of the ILO Convention and Recommendation to stop all forms of gender-based violence and harassment of women and men in the world of work.

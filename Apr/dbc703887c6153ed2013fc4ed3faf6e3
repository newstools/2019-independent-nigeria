LAGOS – The Athletics timetable for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games was unveiled on Tuesday during a ceremony in Tokyo. According to the International Association of Ahletics Federations (IAAF), the athletics event of the 29th Summer Games, which would be spread over 10 days, would commence on Friday 31 July with the men’s 20km race walk, and conclude on the final day of the Games, Sunday 9 August, with the men’s marathon. In between, competition will be spread over 17 exciting sessions at Tokyo’s Olympic Stadium. “The Tokyo 2020 schedule is substantially different from our previous Olympic timetables, but will offer the vast majority of athletics fans attending the Games the opportunity to see Olympic medals being decided, with finals scheduled in 15 of the 17 sessions in the main stadium,’’ IAAF Competitions Director Paul Hardy said. “Having finals in the morning, as requested by the International Olympic Committee, will enhance the visibility of athletics across all time zones. The stadium-based distance events remain in the evening sessions to reduce the risk of very hot conditions for our endurance athletes, while the road events will start as early as practicable in the morning. “The new schedule also accommodates both the traditional doubles and the historic addition of the mixed 4 X 400m relay, the first time that athletics has combined the talents of both male and female athletes in one event at the Games.”

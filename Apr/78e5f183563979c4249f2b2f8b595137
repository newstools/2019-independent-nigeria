Abdullahi while speaking to newsmen Wednesday in Bauchi said that 15 of the petitions were for the National Assembly elections. “We have so far received 26 petitions of which seven are for the Senate. The seven petitions are from all the Senatorial Districts with some having multiples. For the House of Representatives, we have so far received only eight petitions meaning that not all the Representatives submitted their petitions,” he said. Abdullahi said that the tribunal has not received any petition for the Governorship election in the state, pointing out that they still have time to file their petitions, except if they don’t want to challenge the election. He said most of the complainants waited till the last minute before they filed their petitions, adding that they cannot be denied as it is their right and is still within the stipulated time. On whether the tribunal has started sitting, the secretary said that it has started partial sitting on motion ex parte only, adding that as soon as that is done, the next thing they would wait for is filing of memoranda and replies. “When this is over, we will issue out a pre-hearing session notice and together with the inaugural session. As soon as that is done, we would start the pre-hearing session,” he said.

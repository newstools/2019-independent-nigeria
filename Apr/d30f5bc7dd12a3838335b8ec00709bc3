Lagos – Henry Onyekuru has been adjudged the fastest player in the Turkish Super Lig. The rating was done by world renowned United Kingdom-based sports analytics company, OPTA, which takes into account the speed of players per matches played. On Thursday, the company released the analysis of its measurement of speed of players in the Turkish topflight, where the Super Eagles and the Galatasaray winger clocked 32kph over 20 meters to be ranked at the top of the speed list. Onyekuru is on loan at the Istanbul-based club from Premier League side, Everton, until the end of the 2018/19 season. The 21-year-old Nigerian has scored 11 goals and three assists in 24 Super Lig appearances, making him one of the top performers for Gala. He has also recently broken back into the Super Eagles, and has nine caps for the team thus far. He celebrated his full debut for the senior team by scoring in the recent 3-1 win against Seychelles in a 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier. Onyekuru was nominated for the Young Player of the Year at the NFF Awards but lost out to Villarreal’s new kid on the block Samuel Chukwueze. Both players are expected to be included in Nigeria’s final squad for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in June and July.

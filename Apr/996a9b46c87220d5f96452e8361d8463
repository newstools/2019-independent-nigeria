Newcastle defender Florian Lejeune will miss the rest of the season after suffering a “significant knee injury” in Saturday’s defeat by Crystal Palace. The Frenchman was carried off on a stretcher after injuring his left knee in a clash with Andros Townsend. The 27-year-old, who joined the club in 2017, missed the first part of the season with a right knee injury. He has made 12 Premier League appearances for the 15th-placed Magpies since January. Newcastle manager Rafael Benitez said the injury looked bad following the 1-0 loss at St James’ Park. A club statement said further updates would be provided “in due course”.

AKURE – Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State has directed security agencies in the state to arrest perpetrators of the bloody robbery attack on a bank in Idoani, Ose Local Government Area of the state. Akeredolu gave the directive while paying a condolence visit to Alani of Idoani, Oba Olufemi Olutoye, at his palace. Armed robbers on Monday attacked the bank, which was said to be the only one in the community, and killed six persons including a policeman. One person was said to have been arrested by security operatives in connection with the incident. Akeredolu, who was represented by his deputy, Agboola Ajayi, described the incident as unfortunate. The governor implored the security agents to do everything possible to arrest the hoodlums and bring them to justice. “We are glad that a suspect has been nabbed and I am very sure he will create a channel that will lead to the arrest of those criminals,” he said. Akeredolu assured the people of the state that his administration would continue to partner with security agencies to ensure safety of lives and properties. The governor, however, charged them to always assist security operatives by giving them useful information that could help in reducing criminal activities in the state. Oba Olutoye appealed to the state government to assist families of those who lost their lives in the robbery attack. The monarch said the armed bandits also invaded his palace and damaged his doors, adding, however, that their plan failed at the end of the day.

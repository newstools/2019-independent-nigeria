Gusau – The Zamfara State government on Wednesday claimed that that some Fulani people were the brains behind violent acts in the state. Bello Dankande Gamji, the state commissioner for Local Governments and Chieftaincy Affairs, disclosed this at a security meeting held in the ministry with security agencies, emirs, local government chairmen and Fulani leaders in Gusau, the state capital. According to him, security reports indicated that some Fulani people were mainly the perpetrators of the violent activities across the state. He mandated the Fulani leaders to meet with the armed bandits and settle the matter, adding the perpetrators would face the full wrath of the law. He asserted that minority would not be allowed to threaten the peace of the majority in the northeast state. Gamji warned that if the terror attacks continued, the state government would have no other option than to arrests all the Fulani women selling furs da nunu in the urban areas of the state. “The security of lives and properties does not only rest in the hands of the government alone but in the hands of all the law abiding citizens of the country,” he said. However, Mr. Celestine Okoye, the state commissioner of police, said his command had invoked the law banning all commercial motorcycles from 7.00pm to 7.00am to checkmate the activities of the armed bandits operating in the state. But the leaders of the Fulani people said it was very unfair for the state government to jump into conclusion that Fulani people were mainly behind the terror attacks in the state. They maintained that Fulani people lost their lives to the armed bandits and pledged to help the government to find a lasting solution to the development in the state.

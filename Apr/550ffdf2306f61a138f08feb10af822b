Barcelona, 10 points clear at the top of La Liga with nine games remaining, will take another step towards retaining the title, when they travel to relegation threatened Villarreal on Tuesday evening. Barca aiming for a seventh title win, enjoyed Saturday’s derby win against Espanyol, while 17th placed Villarreal were pulled closer to the drop zone by a painful defeat at fellow strugglers RC Celta. Second-placed Atletico de Madrid kept up the pressure with Thomas Partey on the score sheet in Saturday’s 4-0 win at Alaves. Tuesday also brings together two teams hurting from weekend derby defeats, with Espanyol aiming to bounce back from a loss at Barcelona against a Getafe side beaten by neighbours Leganes but still sitting in fourth place and a Champions League qualification spot. 19th placed Rayo Vallecano picked up only a point at home to Real Betis on Saturday, meaning their need for a victory is even greater on Wednesday when they visit an Eibar team who look safe in mid-table now. Third-placed Real Madrid travel to Mestalla on Wednesday evening with Coach Zinedine Zidane likely to bring Luka Modric and Toni Kroos back into the starting XI for a stiff test against a Valencia team who have climbed to sixth thanks to an 11-game unbeaten streak.

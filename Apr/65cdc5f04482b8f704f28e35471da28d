ABUJA – The Nigerian Armed Forces would require alternative sources of funding to adequately meet their training and operational needs, rather than depend on annual budgets, the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshall Sadique Abubakar, has said. The air force boss stated this on Monday in an interview with National Assembly correspondents after a budget defense session with the House of Representatives committee on Air Force in Abuja. He said while the Nigerian Air Force was very appreciative of the support of the National Assembly, there was the need to look beyond the annual budget to alternative sources, adding that “the Air Force is a very expensive institution that requires a lot of resources to function. “And I must say that the National Assembly has been very supportive in that regard, especially the House committee and the Senate committee on air force. And we’re working very closely together to ensure that we get what’s required in terms of platforms, capabilities and manpower so that we can make Nigeria a more secured country.” Asked if he’s satisfied with what has been proposed for the air force in 2019 considering its need for funding as prerequisite for performance, the NAF boss said no institution gets all that it needs in a given fiscal year.

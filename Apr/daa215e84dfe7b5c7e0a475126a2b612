Belgium has apologised for kidnapping thousands of mixed-race children from Congo between 1959 and 1962, in a move to address the legacy of its often brutal 80 years of African colonisation. The apology made on Thursday was the first time Belgium has officially acknowledged responsibility for the policy of segregation under which ‘metis’ children [ born to settlers and local women] were abducted from Congo and put in schools and orphanages in Belgium run by the Catholic Church. “In the name of the federal government, I present my apologies to the metis of the Belgian colonial era and their families for the injustices and the sufferings they have endured,” Prime Minister Charles Michel told Parliament as dozens of former abductees looked on. “I hope that this solemn moment will be an additional step towards an awareness and knowledge of this part of our national history.”

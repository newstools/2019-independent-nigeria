Lagos – The Fiscal Responsibility Commission (FRC) has castigated the contractor handling the N700m Barkin Ladi Irrigation Project in Plateau State. Mr. Moshood Tijani, the Director, Monitoring and Evaluation, FRC, stated that the poor handling of the contract by the contractor had led to its failure and threatened to re-award the contract to a more competent and qualified firm. Tijani  spoke in Plateau state during the visit of the team tone of the federal government’s projects in the North Central. He further condemned the contract awarding process of most agencies in the country, describing them as faulty, saying that rather than place priority on competence, the reverse was the case. He insisted that the contractor handling the ongoing project lacked the required competence to complete it and accused it of wasting the scarce resources of government, while not also giving value for money. He declared that the commission had signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to sanction any contractor who failed to execute project after mobilisation. The team leader said in order to salvage the project from joining the long list of abandoned projects, the FRC would ensure that the project was re-awarded to a competent and experienced contractor with pedigree for similar project execution.

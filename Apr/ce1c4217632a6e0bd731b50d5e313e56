Unai Emery will have just £75million to spend in the summer even if Arsenal manage to secure Champions League football, reports say, according to Metro.co.uk reports. Arsenal are currently in fourth place in the Premier League and remain in with a shot of winning the Europa League. Qualifying for next season’s Champions League would serve as a major boost to Emery, considering Arsenal have struggled for consistency this campaign. But Goal claims the achievement will not have a huge effect on the transfer budget, which will be set at around £75million. Arsenal spent just over £71million last summer having missed out on Champions League football, spending the majority of that money on Lucas Torreira and Bernd Leno. Emery though will be motivated to avoid the possibility of having just £45million to spend should Arsenal miss out on a Champions League spot. Arsenal need a replacement for Juventus-bound Aaron Ramsey and Emery also wants to sign a left-back and wide attacker.

ABUJA – As pressure mounts over who occupies various leadership positions in 9th National Assembly, a group of All Progressives Congress (APC) youths, on Tuesday, staged a protest at the national secretariat of the party in Abuja, demanding that the speakership position be zoned to the North Central geopolitical zone of the country. The group, under the auspices of North Central APC Ambassadors, came armed with a letter dated April 1, which was directed to the national chairman of the party, Adams Oshiomhole, insisting that the zone must be rewarded with the seat because of the number of votes it delivered to President Muhammadu Buhari. The letter, which was copied newsmen, was signed by five states and FCT coordinators. They include Muyideen Yusuf (Kwara), Rita Longjap (Plateau), Muhammad Ibn Muhammad (Niger), Lucas Cassius (Nasarawa) Yahaya Dauda (FCT) and Shehu Araga (Kogi). Despite having the vice president in its kitty both the leadership of the party and national leader of the party, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu had declared their support for a Lagos lawmaker, Femi Gbajabiamila. Other zones, including the North Central, have, however, decried the position of the party. The group argued that since Northwest has the president, South West with vice president and Senate president has been zoned to North East, Speakership must be zoned to North Central. The letter partly read, “NC should be rewarded for its performance in the 2019 election.”

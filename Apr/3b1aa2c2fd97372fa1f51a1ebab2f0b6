ABUJA – Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday charged President Muhammadu Buhari to tender his West African Examination Certificate (WAEC), which he claimed he has, to the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal. The party told the president to stop his campaign spokesperson, Festus Keyamo, from insulting the sensibility of Nigerians with lame attempts at diversionary tactics. PDP, in a statement by its spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan, called on Nigerians to note that in claiming that an aspirant does not need WAEC certificate, but the ability to speak English, to contest for the office of the President, the Buhari Presidency, through Festus Keyamo, has finally admitted that President Buhari does not have a WAEC certificate as he claimed in his INEC form. The party said it is completely inexcusable for President Buhari to swear to an affidavit to claim an educational qualification he does not possess. “An attempt to deceive the public using a defective reading and skewed interpretation of a section of the Constitution cannot exonerate President Buhari. “Moreover, Section 295 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) is very clear on issues of interpretations and reference to questions of law,” PDP said. The party maintained that the onus is on President Buhari, as ‘Mr. Integrity’ to tender the certificate he claims to possess before the tribunal instead of this lame diversion from his aides.

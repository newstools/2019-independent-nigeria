The Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) said that its 2019 Entrepreneurship Mentoring Programme would be declared open by Mr. Babatunde Runsewe, President of the Chamber on Thursday this week at its centre. This year’s edition, which is the seventh in the series, would also feature exhibitions by beneficiaries of the scheme. Muda Yusuf, Director-General, LCCI said: “The scheme is a notable Corporate Social Responsibility initiative of the Chamber, and its objective is to create and develop an army of young entrepreneurs that will be able to manage their various businesses efficiently. We are preparing them to be the future ‘Fortune 50’ companies in Nigeria. “One sure way of investing in the future of the economy is Mentoring the Youth to create and manage businesses. It is a way of launching them into the business world, much better equipped to ride on the waves and challenges in their quest for success.” Yusuf also stressed that developmental initiative such as entrepreneurship development programmes would be the focus of the mentoring scheme.

LOKOJA – The Kogi Judiciary, on Monday, approached the state High Court sitting in Koton-Karfe, seeking nullification of the April 2 resolution of the state House of Assembly recommending the removal of the Chief Judge, Justice Nasir Ajanah. The Motion was filed by Adegboyega Awomolo, who is leading 11 other lawyers including five Senior Advocates of Nigeria (SAN) on behalf of the claimants/applicants, Justice Ajanah, and chief registrar of the state High Court, Alhaji Yahaya Adamu. Awomolo said the Motion Notice (Motion NO. HC/KK02M/201) was brought pursuant to Order 11, Rules 1 and 2 of Kogi State High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, 2006 to counter the action of the Assembly in defying the court order in the impasse between the legislature and the executive arms. The motion has Kogi State House of Assembly, Speaker of the House, Bello Hassan Abdullahi, chairman of the Ad-Hoc Committee, the state governor and the attorney general of state as defendants. The claimants/applicants in the motion contended that the House of Assembly defied the pendency of Suit NO. HC/KK/11CV/2018 and the interim injunctive Orders of the Court to have sat and issued a resolution in respect of the matter. They prayed for an order of the court nullifying and setting aside the resolution purportedly passed by the House at its plenary sitting of April 2, 2019 in defiance of the pendency of the suit. The action of the legislative assembly also defied the interim injunctive Orders of Court by acting upon a report submitted to it by its Public Accounts Committee and resolving that: “The Chief Judge of Kogi State (the 1st Claimant/Applicant herein) be removed for alleged gross misconduct, and ii) That the Chief Registrar of Kogi State High Court (2nd Claimant/Applicant herein) should be referred to the Kogi State Judicial Service Commission for disciplinary action for misconduct.”

Ships carrying thousands of tonnes of rice set off from Huangpu Port in Shanghai on Friday for South Sudan, Somalia and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to help them cope with food security crisis. The UN World Food Programme (WFP) China Office, Qu Sixi, said this at the departure ceremony to mark China’s food assistance to the African countries. This is part of China’s food assistance this year which also covers the Republic of Congo and Lesotho. The five countries are facing a range of issues that can impact food security, including armed conflict, climate-related disasters and sluggish economies. The assistance will mainly support displaced people and refugees, many of whom are women and children. “China’s support enables us to expand our work and to reach more people in urgent need of food assistance,’’ Sixi said. “We hope to further strengthen our partnership with China and make joint efforts toward achieving zero hunger.”
Said Mire, charge d’affaires of Somali Embassy to China, also expressed his gratitude. “We are very grateful for China’s support for this food donation to Somalia and other African brothers,” he said. “Also I would like to thank the WFP for their great support to Somali people.” China’s assistance enabled the WFP to purchase more than 8,700 tonnes of rice in China and other foods worldwide, which will benefit about 300,000 vulnerable people in Somalia, South Sudan and the DRC.

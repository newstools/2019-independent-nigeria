While speaking in a telephone call to congratulate the President upon his resounding election victory, winning a second four-year term of office, Mr. Gates, who  said he was happy to be associated with the President, restated his commitment  to the success of the administration as well as the progress, prosperity and well-being of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. He expressed willingness to do more for the country. President Buhari said that Mr. Gates’ wealth has benefited Nigeria’s development, and expressed appreciation for the call. “I am very happy the way your projects have touched the life of the average Nigerian. The people of this country have given their verdict. This verdict says we have to work hard to meet their expectations. God willing, we will not fail,” the President said.

Pep Guardiola insists that winning the Quadruple will be “almost impossible” after he suffered another injury setback as Manchester City reached the FA Cup final. Kyle Walker was taken off at half-time in the 1-0 victory over Brighton while the City boss revealed that Sergio Aguero, who missed the game through injury, has not trained since last Sunday. “I will announce something to you, it is almost impossible to win the Quadruple, almost,” Guardiola told a news conference. “Put it in the headlines, guys. It is almost impossible to win the Quadruple. Surviving in that stage of the competitions is already a miracle. [No club has gone to April 17 still in contention] that is why it is incredible what these players have done last season when you achieve 100 points. Neither Liverpool nor Manchester City can repeat that. The year after, when you have the tendency to be arrogant or a little more presumptuous or think you are something that really you are not. And still, we are there. That’s why it’s incredible what these players have done before. “Every game we lose players but that is normal when you play a lot of games. We are going to try until the end, every game.”

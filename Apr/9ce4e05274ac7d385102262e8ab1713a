As the host of an Arabic-language talk show in Germany, Jafaar Abdul Karim is supposed to be the man with the answers. But his answers are not always what viewers want to hear. In an episode from January 2017 exploring the rights of a single, unmarried Muslim woman with a child, Sheikh Ahmad Karimah, a scholar at Al Azhar University in Cairo who was a guest on the show, accused Mr. Abdul Karim of “stirring chaos” and “encouraging inappropriate relationships.” “Why don’t you listen to the perspective of Shariah on this?” the professor said, before stalking off the set. It is not only delicate issues that prove uncomfortable. On a recent broadcast of Mr. Abdul Karim’s talk show, “Shabab Talk” (shabab is Arabic for “youth”), an Egyptian woman complained that, even after living as a student in Germany for a year, she had made no German friends.

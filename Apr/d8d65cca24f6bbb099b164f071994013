Lagos – Nigeria’s Oyinlomo Quadre’s sensational run at the African Junior Closed Championships for Under 16s in Hammamet, Tunisia came to an end on Friday, as she was edged in straight sets by Yasmine Kabbaj of Morocco in the semifinals. Quadre had progressed through the draw without the loss of a set, but in the semis she could not match the greater consistency of Kabbaj and lost 6-4, 6-4. The young Nigerian will now turn her attention to the Grade 3 event in Megrine, Tunisia, which will get underway on Tuesday, April 16 at the Tennis Club de Megrine. It would be recalled that Oyinlomo had a brilliant run in Hammamet, conceding only four games against home favourite, Jeribi Gheida to reach the semifinals. She powered to a 6-3, 6-1 victory against the 15-year-old Tunisian. SUNDAY INDEPENDENT gathered that Kabbaj has also edged Quadre in three straight meetings before the semifinal match on Friday. Meanwhile, in the doubles, the Nigerian and her Kenyan partner, Angella Okutoyi, were edged 7-6, 6-3 in the semifinals by the Moroccan pair of Sara Akid and Yasmine Kabbaj.

LAFIA – The Nasarawa State chapter of Meyeti Allah Cattle Breeders Association on Thursday called for peace between Fulani and Mada communities in Agwanga Local Government Area of the state. Alhaji Mohammed Hussaini, the chairman of the association, made the call while answering questions from newsmen in Lafia, the state capital. The chairman said the attack that was carried out in Numa was handwork of criminal elements bent damaging the image of Fulani people, who have lived with Mada people in Agwanga for decades. According to him, “My own findings showed that the attackers were not Fulani people; they are criminal elements who are bent on damaging the image of the Fulani people. These criminal elements can come form Mada, Fulani, and others tribes within the state but they not really Fulani people living in Agwanga communities in Nasarawa State. “We have been living with Mada people for decades; we don’t have any problem with them except the recent one that happened over a rape, which it had been resolved.”

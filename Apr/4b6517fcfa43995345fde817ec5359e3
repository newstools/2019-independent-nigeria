Liverpool’s Champions League run continues with a favourable tie against FC Porto in the quarter-finals with the first leg holding at Anfield. The Reds knocked out Bayern Munich in the round of 16, and their reward is a tie against Portuguese giants Porto – the team they beat 5-0 en route to last season’s final. While Liverpool’s thumping win in Porto last year will fill them with confidence, Sergio Conceicao’s Dragons knocked AS Roma out in the last round and have tightened up in defence. A semi-final against either Manchester United or Barcelona awaits the victors, and Liverpool will be hoping to go one better than last season’s final disappointment against Real Madrid. Andy Robertson was booked late on against Bayern, and that means the left-back will be suspended for the first leg. Robertson will be a big loss for Klopp due to his pace and ability at both ends of the pitch, though James Milner may fill in on the flank. Adam Lallana is a doubt with a muscle problem, while Joe Gomez (ankle) and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (thigh) are on the comeback trail with the former more likely to be available than the latter. Liverpool will come flying out of the traps at Anfield, and much will depend on the opening half-hour. An early goal for the hosts could lead to a rout, but Liverpool have not been at their thrilling best in 2019. Meanwhile, Virgil van Dijk, Joel Matip and Georginio Wijnaldum are all carrying knocks, though none of them are severely injured enough to miss out. “We had little problems after the game, back problems here, Gini Wijnaldum a little back problem, Joel, I think even Virg from a fall on the ground. But they all should be OK, hopefully.” Klopp will also have to be wary of Moussa Marega, who has scored six goals for Porto in the Champions League this season.

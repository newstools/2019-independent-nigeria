Rangers International will have the opportunity to consolidate their hold on the Nigeria Professional Football League Group A table when they entertain Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries (MFM) FC of Lagos on Sunday. The Flying Antelopes have been in blistering form since exiting the CAF Confederation Cup. They have played only 12 out of the maximum 15 matches before this weekend round of matches, with only a loss, eight wins and three draws, having 27 points and +9 goals aggregate. The Olukoya Boys slipped to the third spot from their hitherto first position with 24 points, same with second placed Enyimba with the latter having a superior goals difference. Gbenga Ogunbote, while speaking to SATURDAY INDEPENDENT, said that their plan had not changed, which, according to him, remained to book a place in the playoff. “We are very happy with our form and it is what we expected from the beginning of the season, knowing that the season is short. “But our desire has not changed which is to make it to the playoff and from their possibly return to the continental competition,” he said. When both sides met in Lagos in the reverse fixture, the Olukoya Boys defeated Rangers 1-0 and it is hoped that the Flying Antelopes will make them taste their own pill.

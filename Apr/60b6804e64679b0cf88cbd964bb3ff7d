Billionaire businessman and Chairman of Forte Plc, Femi Otedola has offered a lifeline to ailing former Super Eagles coach, Christian Chukwu, by agreeing to pick his medical bills. The offer came Monday to the relief of Chukwu, his family, friends and admirers around the country. Chukwu, one of Nigeria’s most influential footballers in history who captained the national team to their first Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) title in 1980, is suffering from prostate cancer which has affected his leg and has struggled to raise the necessary funds to make the trip abroad for treatment. Although the surgery on his leg has been done, he reportedly needs an additional $50,000 for the prostate operation.Norbert Okonkwo, media officer of Enugu Rangers, told TheCable that the Enugu state government donated N1.5 million for the leg surgery. In the first two days, a GoFundMe appeal raised $4,305 of the $50,000 needed for further treatment. A patron of Chukwu’s former club, Rangers FC, Benson Ezeomeogo Ejindu, broke the news of the ailment at the weekend.

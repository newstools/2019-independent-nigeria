“State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi have sent a message of condolences to the Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif,” Geng Shuang said addressing the regular press conference on Thursday. He added, “China will positively consider providing assistance based on Iran’s needs.” Meanwhile earlier, Chinese Foreign Minister in his message extended regret over heavy floods and its damages, saying he believes that the Iranian government will rescue people and reconstruct cities with its wisdom. Unprecedented heavy rains caused floods in various parts of Iran over the past two weeks. Scores of people were killed and 478 others were injured and a large number were displaced across Iran. The disaster coincided with the high season of Iranian trips as they were spending the national two-week holidays of Nowruz.

President Muhammadu Buhari has been charged to declare the dare-devil, trigger-happy herdsmen rampaging and killing, maiming, kidnapping and raping innocent Nigerians terrorists group forthwith. This is because the herders’ activities are becoming too dangerous and unbearable to the people of this nation. In a statement in Lagos yesterday, Chief Adesunbo Onitiri, PDP Lagos Central Senatorial candidate in the just concluded election, said the Federal Government should do the needful and declare total and decisive action against them before they kill all of us. According to Onitiri, herders are now more daring and dangerous than the most dreaded Boko Haram ravaging the North-East as they are now found all over the country attacking anybody in sight. Chief Onitiri noted that the herdsmen have killed more people than the Boko Haram within the past one year. “According to newspaper reports, the herdsmen, some of them suspected Fulani, killed an air force man, driver in Edo State, police nabbed four herdsmen for kidnapping a Catholic priest in Enugu, suspected Fulani herdsmen a lady to death recently. In 2016, suspected herdsmen attacked Agatu community in Benue State and killed 16 persons. At another time also in Benue, over hundred people were murdered in coldblooded and which attracted world attention. This is unacceptable to all Nigerians. Speaking on the last general elections, Chief Onitiri who is contesting his defeat during the senatorial poll at the election tribunal described the entire polls as a sham. “Our democracy is in serious danger and all lovers of Democracy should speak up. We should not allow enemies of Democracy to kill our hard earned democracy we fought for”

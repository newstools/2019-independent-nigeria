The Court of Appeal sitting in Benin on Monday nullified the election of Mr Peter Akpatason of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as a member of the House of Representatives for the Akoko-Edo Federal Constituency. The Speaker, Edo House of Assembly, Mr Kabiru Adjoto, had filed an appeal against the judgment of a lower court that held and declared Akpatason as the party’s candidate in the Feb. 23, National Assembly elections. Adjoto claimed that he won the party’s primary election held in October 018, but was denied the ticket by the party leadership which he alleged was also affirmed by the lower court. The Justice Moore Abraham-Adumein-led three-member tribunal, in its Judgment, held that Akpatason was not the right candidate who emerged from the party primary, hence was not qualified to have contested for the March 9 national assembly election. The tribunal subsequently declared Adjoto, being the candidate who emerged from the party primaries, as the right candidate for the Akoko-Edo Federal Constituency. The Court also nullified the decision of the APC’s National Assembly Primaries Election Appeals Committee headed by former Governor of Edo, Prof. Oserheimen Osunbor. Abraham-Adumein held that the trial court ought to have heard the case brought before it “since it is its duty to do so. “The trial court, for reasons best known to it, failed or neglected to make any pronouncement on the live issue before it,” he said. Abraham-Adumein said the Osunbor committee was not properly constituted because the committee contravened Article 21B of the APC guidelines, part of which said, “no member of the five member appeals committee shall be from the state of assignment” and so the committee ab initio ought not to hear the case.

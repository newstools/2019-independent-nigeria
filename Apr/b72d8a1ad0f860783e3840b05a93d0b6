LAGOS – War of words has erupted among boxers taking part in the GOtv Boxing Night 18, holding on Sunday at the Indoor Sports Hall of the Obafemi Awolowo Stadium (formerly Liberty), Ibadan. From Ghana’s Success Tetteh, the challenger for the African Boxing Union (ABU) lightweight title, to the trio of young boxers making their professional debuts at the event, the exchanges between them and their opponents have been infernal. Tetteh, who, last week, promised to end the unbeaten run of his opponent and incumbent champion, Nigeria’s Oto Joseph, has restated his vow, adding that Joseph would not last the distance. “Initially, I thought of making the fans enjoy the fight for much longer, but I’ve concluded that there is no point doing that. I need to finish him off quickly, go back to bed and rest enough for my trip back home. I also have my eyes on the N1 million cash prize provided by the sponsors,” he said.

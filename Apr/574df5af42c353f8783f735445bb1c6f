IBADAN – Comptroller Abdulahi Zulkifilu Argungu, the Area Controller of the Oyo/Osun command of the Nigeria Customs Service, on Tuesday revealed that the command generated N13, 397, 441, 364.71 from excise duties in the first quarter of 2019. Comptroller Argungu, who revealed this at a press conference addressed at the command’s headquarters, Ibadan, maintained that this is against N6,032,964,650.94 generated by the command during the first quarter of 2018, indicating an increase of 101.4 percent. Argungu said the command under his watch has continued to improve on its intelligence driven strategy, and has carried out series of operations at different locations within the command’s area of coverage. He said the operations had led to seizure of contrabands, including four fairly used vehicles, 3 270 bags of imported parboiled rice,  700 25 litres of vegetable oil, fifty 50kg bags of sugar and  20 bales of second hand clothing. Argungu, who revealed that the total Duty Paid Value (DPV) of all the seized items was N105, 728, 974. 66k, said “officers and men of the command would not relent in their fighting against smuggling, in the bid to protect “our indigenous industries, reviving ailing ones and at long run, create wealth and jobs for our teeming unemployed youths.” He, however, lamented, “It is worrisome that despite the continued awareness on the dire consequences of smuggling activities on economic growth and development, some unpatriotic citizens still find joy in perpetrating this dastardly act only for their personal gains.” The Controller of the Oyo/Osun command revealed further that eight people arrested in connection with smuggling were granted conditional bail, and would soon be charged to court. Argungu also informed that one Mr. Bayo Mafo, who was arrested for impersonating as a Customs officer, had been sentenced to three years imprisonment by a Federal High Court sitting in Ibadan.

Olatunde Disu, former Technical Director, Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), on Monday said that the Super Eagles need natural left wingers to have an edge over other teams in this year’s Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). Disu said this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) while reflecting on the chances of the Super Eagles at the coming 2019 AFCON to be hosted by Egypt. The tournament will hold from June 21 to July 19, 2019, and will see the Eagles making their 18th appearance in the competition having first qualified in 1963 held in Ghana. Nigeria won on home soil in 1980 with Disu an assistant coach, after then they won the tournament in Tunisia 1994 and South Africa 2013. However, Disu said that for the team to excel, they needed an infusion of natural left footers to effectively contribute to the attacking lineups. “The team is presently doing well and with what is on ground as my own assessment, the team equally needs the services of natural left footers to join the attack. “Tracing back to history when the team was dominant on the continent, we have natural left footers who were always joining the attackers to score goals.

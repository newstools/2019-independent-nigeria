ABUJA – Twenty political parties in Zamfara State have dragged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) before the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, over refusal of the electoral body to issue certificates of return to the governor-elect and the 24 members-elect of the Zamfara State House of Assembly. The suit filed at the court on Tuesday by Barrister Ebenezer Adabaki, on behalf of the plaintiffs, was marked FHC/ABJ/CS/371/19, and dated March 29, 2019.

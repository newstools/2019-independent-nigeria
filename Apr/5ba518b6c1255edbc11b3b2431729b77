P/HARCOURT – Hundreds of protesters loyal to the minister of transportation, Rotimi Amaechi of the All Progressives Congress (APC) took to the Port Harcourt streets on Tuesday to demand the redeployment of the state resident electoral commissioner (REC), Obo Effanga. As early as 7:30am on Tuesday, the protesters assembled at the air force base and marched towards the presidential hotel where they clashed with suspected thugs and exchanged gunfire. Leader of the protesting group and spokesman of the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF), Anabs Sarah-Igbe, described the protest as a huge success despite the ban by the state government. “But the protest was a huge success despite the ban by the state government. This government is oppressive and we must do everything to ensure that the best government is enthroned. “This government is ready to go all the way even against its own people.”

Men of the Operation Puff Adder, the police formation instituted to fight the increasing kidnapping and armed robbery along the Abuja, Kaduna Expressway, killed nine suspected criminals in a gun battle along the route on April 10 2019. This was disclosed in a press release by Frank Mba, a Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) and the Force Public Relations Officer, Force Headquarters, Abuja, on Sunday, where he revealed that two members of the gang, however, escaped with gunshot wounds. He said that the operation recovered six AK 47 riffles, one pump action gun as well as 1,200 rounds of AK 47 ammunition, among others, noting, however, that one of the police operatives sustained gunshot wound and was being treated as at the time of the report. “The unrelenting efforts to root out criminal elements terrorising commuters along Abuja – Kaduna Expressway recorded additional successes on April 10, 2019, with the recovery of six Ak 47 rifles, one pump action gun, 1,206 rounds of Ak 47 ammunition, seven magazines, 28 cartridges and 158 expended shells by police operatives attached to Operation Puff Adder deployed to the area. “The recovery followed a serious exchange of gun fire between the police operatives and a heavily armed notorious criminal gang at the Akilbu Forest, off Abuja-Kaduna Expressway, which resulted to the death of nine members of the gang while two of them escaped with gunshot wounds. “One of the police operatives, however, sustained a gunshot wound and he is presently receiving treatment in a hospital. Effort is being intensified to arrest the fleeing members of the gang. “While expressing satisfaction with the successes recorded so far in the fight against kidnapping and other heinous crimes across the country, Mohammed Adamu, the acting Inspector General Police (AIG), reiterated his call for support by the public to the police and other sister agencies, as he gave the assurance that the war against armed bandits will soon be won.”

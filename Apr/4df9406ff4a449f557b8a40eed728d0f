LAGOS – The Centre For Anti-Corruption and Open Leadership (CACOL) has hailed the decision of the Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT) sacking Justice Walter Onnoghen, the former Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), and barring him from holding public office for 10 years. CACOL also welcomed CCT’s decision ordering the forfeiture of funds in all the former CJN’s undeclared bank accounts to the Federal Government. Debo Adeniran, CACOL’s Executive Chairman, in a statement issued on Thursday by Okechukwu Ndiribe, the group’s coordinator for research and documentation, further stated that the CCT’s decision had proven that nobody is above the law in Nigeria, no matter how highly placed. According to him: “The CCT’s decision has also demonstrated that Nigeria is being governed in accordance with the rule of law as the long arm of the law must surely catch up with any breaker of the law even if the wheel of justice grinds slowly. “Our position has consistently been that the former CJN ought not to have stayed a day longer in office as he lost even the moral standing to continue to hold high office, the moment he admitted that he did not abide by the provisions of the law to declare all his assets, in line with his oath of office. “We are convinced that this judgment would serve as a deterrent to all other serving and former public officers that their day of reckoning would come for whatever misdemeanor they may have committed while in power.” In another development, CACOL faulted the discharge and acquittal of Mournir Haliru Gwarzo, the suspended Director General of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), who had been standing trial, alongside a commissioner of the commission, Zakwanu Garuba, at a Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court, Abuja, for alleged mismanagement of about N115 million public funds entrusted in their care and other sundry offences bordering on corruption.

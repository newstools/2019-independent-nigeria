ABUJA – About 120 internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), on Monday, received donations of food-accessing smart cards from African Food Farm to curb hunger and alleviate the sufferings of the vulnerable. Aliyu Maina, president, Africa Food Bank Farm, and the initiators of ‘My Food Bank (MFB) Nigeria’ handed the card to the beneficiaries, saying the gesture was to alleviate the plight, especially hunger of the IDPs who are largely women and children, at the Karon-Majiji Camp along Airport Road. According to him, “In line with our vision of creating avenues for millions of people to have access to affordable and free food in any part of the country, we decided to reach out to  IDPs  as a priority. “People are hungry in this country, and we have developed a system whereby they can be fed by other people who are willing to help the needy. “The cards we are activating today are paid for by people of goodwill, who wants every Nigerian to stay out of hunger. “We want every Nigerian to have access to food irrespective of their locations and social standing, in order to eliminate hunger, because when you end hunger, you have solved many other problems,” Maina said. Meanwhile, Hilary Okolobia, the technical director (ICT) of MFB, who activated the smart card, explained that a holder of the card could access free and cheap meal from ‘Food Managers’ (vendors) captured under the programme. “This smart card does not have chips like the ATM card, it is smart because it has a pin which can be accessed anywhere with the use of USSD code. “The moment it is activated, it becomes an account with the name, location and data of the owner, and the owner or donors can deposit money in it.” “This makes a smart and more transparent medium to send food to people in need across Nigeria, because you don’t need the internet, but just your phone to use it,” he said.

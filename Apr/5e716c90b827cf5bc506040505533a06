LAGOS  – The Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), has said that  it would begin automation of the call-up system in the ports in Lagos by August. NPA’s General Manager, Corporate and Strategic Communication, Mr Adams Jatto,  who disclosed this in Lagos,said the commencement of the take-off of the call-up system was hampered   by the shoreline protection for the Tin-Can axis, of the truck terminal. He said:“We have concluded the procurement process to be able to engage our investors to manage the truck park.With this, I believe we should be able to have something on ground for people to be proud of. “Call up system is not just the areas we are looking at, for us to ease the congestion along the port access roads.It is a kind of temporary measure for us to ensure that we have a free flow on the axis that leads  to the ports. “The call-up system is for us to be able to have truck parks along port areas and some of the truck owners have assured us that they have truck parks, where they can park their trucks,” he said, adding that a call-up system is to ensure that in each of the areas where there are truck parks, the trucks are there and when it is time for them to come to the ports, “we have to adopt the call-up system to call them.”

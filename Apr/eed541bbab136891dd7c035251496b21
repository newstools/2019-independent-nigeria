President of the Nigeria Basketball Federation (NBBF), Musa Kida has ascribed leadership crisis rocking the federation as the reason for not holding the Annual General Meeting (AGM) in two years. According to him, doing so now after two years in office should be a day for sober reflection considering the state of Nigerian basketball in the country. To this end, the President urged all basketball stakeholders in Nigeria to join hands together as it gives opportunity of sharing ideas adding that he was willing to work with each and every stakeholders in Nigeria devoid of sentiments. “The reason for holding our first AGM at this point after the Nigerian Basketball family entrusted the Board with running the affairs of basketball in 2017, is well known to us all. Against the background of the acrimonious election in 2017, this is indeed a time for sober reflection.” Kida said in Abuja on Saturday. “I wish to state categorically that the board is willing to work with each and every basketball stakeholders in Nigeria devoid of sentiments. There is no ‘us’ or ‘them’ and we will continue to do all it takes to carry everyone along. I am therefore, using this opportunity once again to call on all Basketball stakeholders in Nigeria to join hands with me and my Board to enable Nigerian Basketball attain the desired height in the world.” He conclude

Two ex-internationals, Henry Nwosu and Alloy Agu, have applauded Odion Ighalo’s decision to snub Barcelona when the La Liga ginsts indicated interest in signing him. The duo praised him for putting his career above the chance of being known as Barcelona player. Ighalo, last week, revealed that he turned down the offer in order to concentrate on his career with Chinese Super League side, Shanghai Shenhua. Speaking to our correspondent, Henry Nwosu, former Super Eagles captain, said that it was right the player took his stand and not be attracted to the chance of starring for Barcelona where he might likely find game time difficult “He followed his mind and that makes him a man. I commend him because at Barcelona, they may not use him as he is presently enjoying. It is right,” Nwosu said. Speaking in the same vein, Alloy Agu, the Super Eagles goalkeeper trainer, who was once the goal tender of the national team, said that it was good that he continues to play where he would remain very competitive, particularly as he was gradually advancing in his career “China may not be one of the top leagues in the world but Ighalo has remained very competitive playing there. I seriously doubt whether he will be playing week in week out in Barcelona but the decision was entirely down to him and he took it,” Agu said.

Guinea and Nigeria played out a scoreless 90 minutes in the first semi-final of the 13th CAF U-17 Cup of Nations in Tanzania on Wednesday, before a marathon penalty shoot-out that ended when Ogaga Oduko kicked the ball over the bar to send the Junior Syli Nationale into Sunday’s final. Golden Eaglets fluffed several golden opportunities that would have long settled the encounter before the end of regulation time, and paid dearly in the lottery of penalty kicks as they would be battling for the bronze instead of the gold. Forward Wisdom Ubani should have done better with two opportunities in the first half, but he delayed his decision each time and the chances went away. Guinea came close through Bah Algassime and Toure Momo but also could not utilize the openings. Seven minutes into the second half, Ubani fluffed another golden opportunity when it appeared easier to put the ball in the net, and three minutes later, Fawaz Abdullahi’s dipping shot flew narrowly over the bar.

MAKURDI – There is controversy surrounding the killing of Orkuma, son of a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Prince Yandev Amaabai, at Yandev, a suburb of Gboko Local Government Area (LGA) of Benue State on Saturday night. It was learnt that Orkuma and his girlfriend, whose name DAILY INDEPENDENT was yet to ascertain as at press time, were shot by unknown gunmen in front of his family house at Yandev. Prince Yandev Amaabai was the Director of Security of the PDP Campaign Council in the just concluded elections in Benue sState. However, the State Command of the Nigeria Police said it was yet to get official report on the killing of the son of the PDP chieftain. Speaking to DAILY INDEPENDENT in Makurdi on Sunday, the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) of the command, Sewuese Anene, said the matter was yet to get to her notice. The killing of Okuma is, however, shrouded in controversy with different interpretations to it. DAILY INDEPENDENT gathered that on the one hand, it is being alleged that the killing of Orkuma was a retaliatory attack by a militia group for the killing of two of its members in Wannune, Tarka Local Government Area of the state, a few months ago, while on the other hand it was alleged that it was connected to thugs of the opposition party in the state. Sources in Gboko and Wannune told this newspaper that a few months ago some boys belonging to Ghana, who is wanted by the police, were set on fire at Wannune over allegations of kidnapping. They explained that after the incident, the militia had vowed to avenge the death of its members. Although, up to the time of compiling this report, DAILY INDEPENDENT could not ascertain the connection between the Amaabai family and the boys allegedly set ablaze.

The Minister of Labour and Employment, Sen. Chris Ngige at the weekend advocated the need for increased budgetary allocation for the Ministry, especially a separate funding for the Geneva Labour Desk in the Ministry’s 2019 budget. Speaking at the Ministry’s 2019 budget defence at the National Assembly, Ngige   explained that this became necessary as the Geneva Labour Desk lacked adequate personnel, structures and logistics befitting Nigeria’s enhanced status at the International Labour Organisation (ILO). According to him, “Nigeria is now on the governing board of the International Labour Organisation in Geneva, Switzerland after ten years of exit”. He appealed to the National Assembly “to help return the Geneva Labour Desk as an independent line item in the Ministry’s budget breakdown”. Ngige also called for an upward review of the budget for the Skill Acquisition Centres for increased training opportunities for the Nigerian youths. The Minister equally solicited the revival of the Labour Advisory Council, which has been moribund for six years. “ILO encourages the establishment of the Council by member countries because it serves as an avenue for social dialogue”, Ngige added. On job creation, the Minister noted that there has been an increase in employment since the inception of the present administration, “as many government agencies are employing and government is also creating agro-based jobs in the agricultural sector of the economy”. Responding, the Chairman, Senate Committee on Employment and Labour, Senator Abu Ibrahim, appealed to the Ministry to promote the generation of more employment opportunities for the citizens, especially the youths.

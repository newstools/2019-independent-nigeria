Alhaji Yusuf Suleiman, di- rector general the all Pro- gressive Alliance (APC) Gubernatorial Campaign Organisation in Sokoto has lauded members of the par- ty for coming out to vote for the party’s candidates in the just concluded general election. The party’s candidate, Ahmed Aliyu, narrowly lost the governorship elec- tion to incumbent Aminu Tambuwal of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Suleiman, a former min- ister, speaking on Sunday, said the APC had filed a petition at the tribunal to retrieve what he called ‘the stolen mandate’. “We won the election but INEC and PDP in Sokoto rigged the elections”, he said. “Well we will not say we didn’t get the ticket of the governor. We will rather say that somehow, through some inexplica- ble reasons, the returning officer declared Governor Aminu Tambuwal as gov- ernor-elect.”

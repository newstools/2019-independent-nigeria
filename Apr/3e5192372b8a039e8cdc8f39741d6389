UK minister for Asia and the Pacific, Mark Field arrived in Dhaka today for a two-day visit. During his visit, he will discuss contribution to the higher education sector in Bangladesh, a press release issued by British High Commission in Dhaka today. Field will be the first UK minister to meet Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina since the country’s elections last December. He will discuss with her how the UK can continue to support Bangladesh as it establishes itself as a Middle-Income Country and will also raise with her governance issues and media freedom. Minister Field said: “Bangladesh is changing rapidly, as demonstrated by its transition to Middle Income Country status. Ensuring that economic success story continues means investing in its workforce and improving access to high-quality tertiary education. This is an area where our two countries can clearly work together for mutual benefit.” During his visit the minister will also meet with the Bangladesh Cricket Team, ahead of England hosting the Cricket World Cup.

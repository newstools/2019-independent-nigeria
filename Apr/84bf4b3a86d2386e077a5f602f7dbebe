We don’t deal much in containerized cargo,” adding that compliance to trade rules and increase in cargo throughput brought about the increase in revenue generation. Appraising the stakeholders’ compliance level with extant rules, Comptroller Dixon said: “I will say 75 per cent because you still find some loopholes. We are trying gradually with the enlightenment, collaboration and communication by interacting with them every time. We also hold meetings with them reminding them about the rules and why they must stay compliant at all times. Very many are complying but you will still find some few number of people attempting to do it wrongly here and there, but we are on top of the game. Our vigilance is high and will continue to increase.”

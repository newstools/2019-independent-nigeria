LAGOS – The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Federal Operations Unit, Zone ‘A’ with headquarters in Lagos said that it recorded a total of N2 billion seizures between February April 6 to April 16, 2019. Comptroller Aliyu Mohammed, the Customs Area Controller of the Unit, who made the disclosure yesterday during a press briefing in Lagos, said the seizures items  includes 113 units of exotic vehicles with Duty Paid Value (DPV) of  N1,339,088,544:00 and other seizures worth N610,470,320:00. Mohammed conducted journalists round the Unit’s warehouse where various smuggled and prohibited drugs without National Agency for Food and Drugs Administration and Control (NAFDAC) numbers were kept. He reiterated his resolve to sustain the fight against illicit drug smuggling as a way of justifying recent World Customs Organisation (WCO) and NAFDAC awards bestowed on him and his Unit recently for his contributions towards the fight against drug smuggling. “I am ready to do more in the fight against fake and unregistered drugs. The award given to me is serving as a motivation to continue in stopping the illegality of drug smuggling. “Some of the smuggled drugs concealed with other goods do not have NAFDAC number and they are capable of destroying lives. “Our duty as Customs officers is not only collect revenue and facilitate trade. We are working to save lives too. Those who are complaining about our presence on the roads are not sincere in their dealings. “We make these seizures daily and we rely on intelligence to uncover what smugglers are hiding. On the allegations of harassment of smugglers by customs officers, our men work with information and endeavour not to inconvenience travelers, while performing our duty. “Our warehouse is filled with rice seizures and more are being seized. We encourage Nigerians to patronise our high quality locally grown rice,” he said. The seized drugs are codeine syrup, diclofenac, paracetamol injection and Chest and Lung tablets Other seizures shown to journalists are trucks of rice valued at N190,961,320:00; 180 Jerry cans of 25 litres  vegetable oil worth N1,440,000:00; 157 bales of used clothes valued at N9,420,000:00; frozen poultry products worth N1,400,000:00 and 265 pieces of used tyres worth N1,855,000:00.

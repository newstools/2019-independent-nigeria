Benin – The Edo Command of the Nigerian Prisons Service (NPS), on Monday, retrained no fewer than 36 welfare officers in the state towards sharpening their professional skills for efficient service delivery. Joseph Usendiah, the state controller of prisons, who declared the two-day workshop opened on Monday in Benin City, urged the participants to put what they acquired in the workshop into practice in their various prisons’ yards. Usendiah, who was represented by the assistant controller of prison, Austin Izedomwen, said the purpose of the workshop was to get deserving results. In her welcome address, the assistant controller of prisons in charge of welfare, Mrs. Bridget Iyamu, said training and retraining was the key to achieving the goal. According to Iyamu, the exercise, which was at the instance of the command, was aimed at complimenting the efforts of the comptroller general of prisoners, Ja’afaru Amend, in the drive for excellent. “The workshop would sharpen their skills mostly in dealing with the prisons inmates, staffs, visitors, chaplains, and the general public,” Iyamu said. She, however, thanked the state controller of prisons for his approval and support towards the hosting of the workshop. She said the workshop would address a technical session centre on effective reporting of activities from the units. “This is necessary as it is said that ‘all good works without due documentation (report) may become empty stories,” she said. The resource person, Samuel Dibie, who is the former controller of prisons, said one of the qualities of social welfare officers was to have a positive attitude and sense of humor. A professional training, according to him, “is very necessary to become welfare officers even if you have a degree.” Debie, however, urged the participants to have the ability to maintain a healthy balance between their personal and professional life. He added that in this case, one should show empathy and not sympathy.

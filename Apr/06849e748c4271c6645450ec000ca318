 “Pakistan can trade with Europe and beyond through Iran and Turkey,” said Pakistani Finance Minister Asad Umar on Tuesday, according to Irna.ir reports. “Turkey and Iran can also trade with India and China through Pakistán and closing this corridor doesn’t benefit anybody,” he added, addressing a forum in Islamabad. The Pakistani minister stressed that further trade ties between regional countries will bring about their progress and prosperity.

LAGOS – After failing to qualify for the CAF U-17 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) final, Golden Eaglets head coach, Manu Garba, has rued his team’s loss to Guinea. Garba, however, praised his players, stating that they played ‘gallantly’ in the face of ‘bigger’ Guinea U17 boys. In the semifinal game, Eaglets played goalless before losing 10-9 on penalties. “I congratulate my colleague for the victory but I must say that even in defeat we lost gallantly, despite the fact that the Guineans were bigger in size than my boys,” Garba said after the match. On Saturday, Nigeria face Angola who were defeated on penalties by Cameroon – in the third place and fourth place play-off. Despite the defeat, the Golden Eaglets have been commended for giving a good account of themselves and the country. Eaglets and the Guineans ended the full time score at 0-0 but lost 10-9 in the energy sapping shootout. The team is however among the four representing Africa at the FIFA U-17 World Cup slated for Brazil later in the year. Others are Angola, Guinea and Cameroon. Officials of the bank, sponsors of the Delta State Principals’ Cup and the NFF Future Eagles project for U-13s and U-15, spoke to the players and officials in Tanzania only on Thursday. Zenith Bank expressed delight over the fighting spirit of the team.

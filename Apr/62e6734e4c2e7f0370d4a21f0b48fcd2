Lagos – As Nigerians await the inauguration of President Muhammadu for his second term in office, a call has gone to him to set up a high-powered economic review committee to review the economic policy of his government and align it with the monetary policies of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). Otunba Lateef Owoyemi, a former president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN), made the call while speaking with Daily independent a telephone interview. According to him, there is a need to harmonise the differences in the fiscal policies of the Federal Government and the monetary policies of the CBN to ensure that Nigerian economy creates jobs for her teeming population and added that the number of unemployed persons in country was too high and unacceptable. Owoyemi said that presidency should convoke high-powered Economic Review Committee comprising members of the All Progressives Congress (APC), who are economic experts, top members of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) like the governor, deputy governors and top directors of the apex bank. He stated that the President should also appoint economic experts into the committee, adding that their task would be to look at the manifesto of the All Progressives Alliance and harmonise it with the monetary policy direction of the CBN. The renowned accountant, who is also the chief executive officer of LOP Consult Nigeria, also called on the Federal Government to adopt a two-year budget cycle in order to reduce the time budgets are sent to the National Assembly and time they are passed into law. He posited that the current one-year budget was not having a positive impact on the Nigerian, as according him, not much was being achieved before the budgets were passed. The former president of ICAN argued that if the country adopts a two-year budget cycle, there would be adequate time to prepare and pass a budget that would be in the interest of Nigerians.

Lagos – Victor Moses dream of a permanent deal with Fernebahce of Turkey is hanging in the balance following his parent club, Chelsea’s decision to snub a bid of €5m from Fernebahce. Moses has set tongues wagging with his sterling performances in the Turkish Super Lig, and Chelsea, want to cash in on the star’s lift. Although Moses has been out of the spotlight in recent days, his early burst of form with The Yellow Canaries left many mouths agape, and the Istanbul-based side starting make plans to get him in a permanent deal. In order to prove true their plans for Moses, Fernebahce made a €5m bid for the former Super Eagles’ winger, only to be snubbed by Chelsea, who believe the player is now worth more. Consequently, The Blues rejected Fernebahce’s initial bid to get Moses in a full transfer this summer, as the London club viewed their offer as insufficient for the player’s current market value and urged the Istanbul outfit to increase the proposed fee. However, in their bid to get Moses at their preferred rate this summer, Fenerbahce’s sporting director, Damien Comolli will travel to London to meet Chelsea’s top brass, with a view to tying up an agreeable deal. Comolli, who used to be in the pay of Chelsea’s fellow-London-based EPL rivals, Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur, is again high in the picture for a deal, after playing a role in Moses joining Fenerbahce in January. Fenerbahce are now hanging unto Comolli’s expertise, connections, influence and abilities to hook Moses, who signed for Chelsea in 2012 and comes off contract with The Blues at the end of the 2020/21 season.

LAGOS – Usman Abd’Allah, the Enyimba of Aba technical adviser, has praised his players following their 2-0 defeat of Kwara United in the Nigeria Professional Football League on Sunday. Stanley Dimgba scored twice to return Enyimba to winning track following the setback of last week’s goalless draw against Bendel Insurance. Sunday’s win has returned Eyimba into second in group A, and Abd’Allah attributed the outcome to the mental sturdiness of his players. “I am happy with the mentality of the players because after what happened last week they were able to compose themselves and come back and prove that they can do it,” Abd’Allah noted. “It’s a very good comeback by the players. We did a lot of counselling and meetings and there’s a lot of support from the management, also from the supporters. “The team came back with this fantastic result. I’m happy with it and hope we keep on going on with this unbeaten record. This is the ninth match unbeaten. It’s a record and we hope to go on. The most important thing is to get to the playoffs and we will by God’s grace.”

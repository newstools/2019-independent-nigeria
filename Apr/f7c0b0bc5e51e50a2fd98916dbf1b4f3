LAGOS – Oto Joseph, known as Joe Boy, has successfully defended his African Boxing Union (ABU) lightweight title. The Nigerian, on Sunday, saw off the feeble challenge of Ghana’s Success Tetteh at GOtv Boxing Night 18, which held at the Indoor Sports Hall of the Obafemi Awolowo Stadium, Ibadan. Joe Boy, miles ahead in ability, toyed with the dire Tetteh before knocking him out in the first round. In the other title fight on the night, Ridwan Oyekola dethroned Taofeek Bisuga as the national super featherweight champion. Oyekola thrice dropped Bisuga on the canvas in a fight that ended in 46 seconds. In the light middleweight division, Akeem Sadiku knocked out Republic of Benin’s Ekpresso Djamihou in the fourth round of an international challenge duel. West African Boxing Union welterweight champion, Rilwan Babatunde, made an impressive return to action, dismissing Ganiyu Kolawole in the third round of their duel. Rising lightweight star, Taiwo Agbaje, knocked out Michael Jacobs in the first round of their challenge duel. The super bantamweight bout between Opeyemi Agbaje and Sadiq Adeleke ended in a draw. Jamiyu Akande defeated fellow debutant Mufutau Oloke via a second round knockout, the same outcome as the clash between Isaac Chukwudi and Jubril Olalekan, which was won by the former.

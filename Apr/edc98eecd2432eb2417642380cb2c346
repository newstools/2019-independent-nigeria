Fernando Llorente ADMITS to handballing Champions League winning goal at Man City
TOTTENHAM hero Fernando Llorente admits he thought his tie-winning goal against Manchester City in the Champions League quarter-final went in off his hand, according to Dailystar.co.uk reports. Spurs edged out Man City in a European thriller last night, with the north London side progressing on away goals, 4-4 the aggregate score over the two legs. With five goals inside the first 21 minutes, the Etihad crowd knew they were in for a treat. And at 3-2, Spurs were heading through thanks to their two away goals. This left Tottenham chasing an equaliser. And that is exactly what super-sub Llorente provided with around 15 minutes left to play. Bundled in from a corner, it was certainly not the most polished of finishes. The ball cannoned past Ederson having appeared to come off the Spaniard’s thigh, with his hand a little too close to the ball for comfort. The goal was then checked by VAR, and as would later be the case with Raheem Sterling’s ruled out injury-time strike, it looked favourably on Spurs and Llorente. However, according to the player himself, the video referee may have missed something. Llorente told COPE after the match: “I was screwed, I thought they cancelled it. “I knew I had given him with the body and with the hand, although I had it stuck while Sterling’s goal looked at my teammates on the floor and suddenly we see that it’s out of the game… it’s a movie.” Tottenham will take on Ajax in the semi-finals, with a final against Liverpool or Barcelona all to play for. The Dutch side saw off Juventus to reach this stage, having already beaten Real Madrid in the previous round. And Llorente admits Spurs will have to be on top form if they are to topple the Eredivisie giants and reach the final. He went on: “Incredible football they are practising and they are going through a very sweet moment. “We will have to play very well with Ajax, they come with a lot of confidence.”

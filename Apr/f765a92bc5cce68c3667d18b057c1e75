Warri – The presidential amnesty programme has made tremendous impact in developing the oil-rich Niger Delta region and also put smiles on the oil bearing communities. Murphy Ganagana, the media officer to the coordinator of the programme, who disclosed this to newsmen in Warri on Monday, said the arrow-head of the programme, since assumption of office about a year ago, had been able to execute a lot of projects that have fast track development of the Niger-Delta area. “On his path to charting a new course for the amnesty programme, Professor Charles Dokubo has surmounted several obstacles by sheer determination and the tonic required to motive him is support and encouragement from critical stakeholders and other quarters which he doesn’t lack,” stressed the media aid. Determined to facilitate job placement for beneficiaries of the programme, the coordinator, the media aide noted, created job placements and international development partners’ engagement unit last May, adding that the unit has profiled 28 delegates for under water welding jobs in oil serving companies. Besides, Senator Peter Nwaboshi, the chairman, Senate Committee on Niger Delta, declared, “since the programme was established with four chief executives as special advisers and co-coordinators, I can confidently say that the present coordinator (Dokubo) has been very proactive and eager to realize the mandate of the programme.”

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un further cemented his grip on power, in a big reshuffle of the country’s leadership. However, he didn’t signal a retreat, either from negotiations with the U.S., or a self-imposed moratorium on testing of missiles and nuclear bombs, something Pyongyang said he had been considering. Instead, Kim’s remarks pointed to economic belt-tightening, in an attempt to ride out economic sanctions — and perhaps the Trump administration, too – while hanging onto his country’s nuclear arsenal. At a session in Pyongyang of the newly elected parliament — the result of voting last month in which all candidates ran unopposed – Kim was re-elected as Chairman of the State Affairs Commission. That means he retains, as expected, his posts as leader of the ruling party, state and military. He added an extra honorary title though, “Supreme Representative of all the Korean People,” apparently for use in ceremonial and diplomatic occasions. Long-serving officials such as 91-year-old Kim Jong Nam, the titular head of state, and Premier Pak Pong Ju, 80, were either retired or promoted to symbolic posts, and replaced by younger officials.

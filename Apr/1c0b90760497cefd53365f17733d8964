Turkey’s opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP) said on Wednesday that its candidate for mayor of Istanbul, Ekrem Imamoglu, had been declared the winner of a poll that took place on March 31. The CHP said Imamoglu had received the certificate from the Supreme Electoral Council (YSK) that he needs to take office. The YSK has not commented. Turkey’s ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) has disputed the results of the March 31, poll citing fraud and demanding a rerun. It is unclear when the YSK is to announce its decision on the bid. Preliminary results of the mayoral race showed Imamoglu winning a razor-thin victory against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s close associate and former Prime Minister, Binali Yildirim.

Liverpool beat Porto on Wednesday evening to progress to the semi-finals of the Champions League. The 4-1 win – with goals from Sadio Mane, Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Virgil van Dijk – sealed the win for the Reds in yet another impressive European performance. However, Jurgen Klopp’s side will face a much stronger test in the last four, as they face a formidable Barcelona team, containing the likes of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Philippe Coutinho. But, which side has the strongest first XI? And how do the players compare individually? We used FIFA 19 to find out. To find out, we used FIFA 19 to rank the best player in each position for either side, comparing both their current ability and their potential ability. These are the results Current ability: 87 vs 89 Potential ability: 91 vs 92 Alisson has proven to be an excellent addition to Liverpool’s squad and is clearly a top quality goalkeeper, but Ter Stegen has better ability and potential according to FIFA 19. Liverpool 0-1 Barcelona Current ability: 80 vs 83 Potential ability: 89 vs 84 Sergi Roberto is a quality right back and is better than Alexander-Arnold right now – so say EA Sports – but the young England international can become far better than the Spaniard in the future. Liverpool 1-1 Barcelona Current ability: 89 vs 88 Potential ability: 91 vs 88 Gerard Pique is one of the world’s best defenders, having won the World Cup, European Championship, La Liga, Premier League and Champions League trophies amongst others, but Virgil van Dijk is already rated more highly than him and can become even better, according to FIFA 19. Liverpool 2-1 Barcelona  Current ability: 78 vs 87 Potential ability: 88 vs 92 Joe Gomez is a good defender who has great potential, but he’s no match for Samuel Umtiti on FIFA 19. Liverpool 2-2 Barcelona Current ability : 83 vs 87 Potential ability: 88 vs 87 According to FIFA 19, Jordi Alba is one of the best left-backs in world football, but Robertson can become even better than the Spaniard. Liverpool 3-2 Barcelona  Current ability: 85 vs 89 Potential ability: 89 vs 89 Fabinho has proven himself to be a top-class midfielder this season but Busquets has been performing that role with great distinction for a number of years. Even though the Brazilian isn’t as good right now, FIFA 19 says he can reach the same level in the future. Liverpool 3-3 Barcelona Current ability: 83 vs 87 Potential ability: 88 vs 87 Rakitic is one of the world’s most underrated midfielders, but Keita has the potential to surpass the Croatian’s ability on FIFA 19. Liverpool 4-3 Barcelona  Current ability: 83 vs 83 Potential ability : 83 vs 90 Wijnaldum is a very good player and is at the same level as playmaker Arthur right now, but the Brazilian has incredible potential, whilst the Dutchman can’t get any better on FIFA 19. Liverpool 4-4 Barcelona Current ability: 86 vs 87 Potential ability: 86 vs 88 Mane has been in superb form for Liverpool this season but former Reds playmaker Coutinho is rated higher on FIFA 19, despite his recent struggles. Liverpool 4-5 Barcelona  Current ability: 89 vs 94 Potential ability: 90 vs 94 There’s no denying that Salah is one of the best players in the world, but Messi is one of the greatest players to ever play the game. Liverpool 4-6 Barcelona Current ability: 86 vs 91 Potential ability: 87 vs 91 Firmino is perfectly suited to Liverpool’s style of play and is a very good striker on FIFA 19, but another former Reds player Suarez is rated much more highly on FIFA 19. Overall score: Liverpool 4-7 Barcelon  GK: Barcelona (Ter Stegen) RB: Liverpool (Alexander-Arnold) CB: Liverpool  (Van Dijk) CB: Barcelona (Umtiti) LB: Liverpool (Robertson) DM: Barcelona (Busquets) CM: Liverpool (Keita) CM: Barcelona (Arthur) RW: Barcelona (Messi) LW: Barcelona (Coutinho) ST: Barcelona (Suarez) Overall, Barcelona have a better squad according to FIFA 19, but Liverpool are not far off at all, they can cause Messi and co real problems in the UEFA Champions League semi-final. Who do you think will go through? And do you agree with the FIFA 19 ratings

England rugby bosses have said they will talk to Billy Vunipola after the player defended a social media post by Australian star Israel Folau in which he said “hell awaits” gay people. Vunipola wrote on Instagram that what Folau said “isn’t that he doesn’t like or love those people”. England’s number eight makes it clear that “I don’t HATE anyone”, but adds that Folau is saying “how we live our lives needs to be closer to how God intended them to be. “Man was made for woman to pro create that was the goal no?” A Rugby Football Union spokesperson told Sky Sports News: “Rugby is an inclusive sport and we do not support these views. We will be meeting with Billy to discuss his social media posts.” The England back row forward’s club side Saracens have said in a statement they will also investigate. “Billy Vunipola’s recent social media posts are inconsistent with this and we take this matter very seriously. It will be handled internally,” the Premiership Rugby club commented.

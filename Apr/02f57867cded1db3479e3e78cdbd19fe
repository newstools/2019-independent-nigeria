Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola says Premier League title rivals Liverpool are “one of the best teams I have seen in my life”. City are one point above the Reds after beating Tottenham 1-0 on Saturday. Both teams have four games remaining, with Liverpool having the chance to return to the top of the table when they visit relegation-threatened Cardiff City on Sunday (16:30 BST). “The title is still in our hands,” said Guardiola. ‘Chewed fingernails and unbearable tension – Man City show their steely side’ Manchester City, who won the title by 19 points last season and finished 25 points above fourth-placed Liverpool, have now won 10 straight league games.

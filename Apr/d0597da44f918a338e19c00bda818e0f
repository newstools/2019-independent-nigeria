Having struggled for form on the road this season, Al Hain-Cole expects Arsenal to struggle against the Napoli at the intimidating San Paolo The Stadio San Paolo crowd will be hoping for a famous comeback when Napoli play host to Arsenal in Thursday’s Europa League quarter final. Napoli lost 2-0 in last week’s first leg in London, but will remain optimistic of progression considering they have lost just once in 16 home matches in this competition. Having run out 2-0 winners in their previous home game against this opposition in 2013, they are 7/10 (1.70) favourites with bet365 to at least restore some pride with a victory. Arsenal have lost both of their knockout stage matches on the road this season, and are 15/4 (4.75) outsiders to book their place in the semi-finals with an impressive win, or 29/10 (3.90) to do so with a draw. Raul Albiol is unlikely to feature despite returning to training this week, while Amadou Diawara is also doubtful. Lucas Torreira is a doubt for Arsenal after coming off with a groin injury against Watford on Monday, with Rob Holding, Hector Bellerin and Danny Welbeck all long-term absentees. The Gunners will be extremely relieved to be visiting a notoriously difficult away ground with the luxury of a two-goal cushion given their poor record on the road. Arsenal have lost seven of their last 12 fixtures away, with their only victories in that period coming at Blackpool, Huddersfield and a Watford side that played the majority of the match with 10 men. This hardly inspires confidence for a trip to a stadium where Carlo Ancelotti’s team has won 16 out of 22 matches this season, with Juventus the only away team to leave with three points.

In a match between Sevilla and Rayo Vallecano this evening, both teams need points to gain their respective aims. For Sevilla, they are hoping for a champions League spot whilst Rayo Vallecano are looking to merely stay up, being at the base of the table currently. Sevilla bowed out of the Europa League in dramatic circumstances in Prague last month. A goal late in extra time sent them to a 4-3 defeat on the night as Sevilla exited a competition that has come to define them. That had serious consequences for Pablo Machin who was sacked with veteran Joaquin Caparros returning to steer the club to the end of the campaign, something he managed skillfully last term. At one stage this season, Sevilla looked absolutely nailed on for Champions League qualification but theyâ€™ve really seen their league form take a serious downturn. The sheer volume of football has been a factor. They were embarrassed in their last game as they lost 3-0 to Getafe on Sunday but are still only two points off the top four and they will be hoping to finish in the champions league spaces. Rayo have only got 4 points from their past 11 but there has been an improvement since Paco Jemez took charge. They beat Valencia 2-0 at home in their home game before competing well but ultimately losing 3-2 at Athletic Bilbao. In their last game, they drew 0-0 with Huesca. With a match against Real Madrid immediately following this, they simply have to claim maximum points from this game to stand any realistic chance of being in the hunt heading into the final few weeks. Rayo have also made a shift to be more attacking under their new boss. 5 of their last 6 games have seen both teams score. 75% of their home league games this term have also produced goals at both ends of the pitch.

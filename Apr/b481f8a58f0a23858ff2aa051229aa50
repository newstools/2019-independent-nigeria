It is no longer news that prices of onions which had been on persistent rise, hitting the roofs from October to December 2018, started reducing gradually in January 2019, dwindling further in the week under review, in nearly all the markets visited. With increased supply from Niger, a neighbouring country as well as some Northern areas in Nigeria, traders had no option than to bring down the prices of the commodity the more, to boost sales and patronage. More so, as failure to sell the commodity on time, especially, if demand is low, may amount to severe losses for the traders since it is a perishable item. The commodity which health benefits cannot be over-emphasised is patronised by all and sundry regardless of the season. But then, the onset of its season of plenty has enabled a large number of traders who abandoned the trade for a cheaper one to resume business. Likewise, some of them who reduced their purchases for the purpose of continuity during the period of scarcity are now able to buy and up their normal purchases because of the drastic reduction in the prices of the commodity. During the week, findings from a market survey across some states by the Business and Market Intelligence Unit of DAILY INDEPENDENT indicated that prices of a bag of onions reduced sharply by over 25 per cent between January and April 4, 2019. Reasons for the decline, according to the survey results, were increased supply arising from on-season effect, availability and lack of purchasing power. Checks at the Dei-Dei Market, Abuja, showed that prices of onions were at a sliding trend. For example, prices of a 100kg bag of the commodity that previously attracted between N13,500 and N14,000 declined sharply to between N9,000 and N10,000, a  26 or 28 per cent drop. Mallam Abdul who trades in the commodity at the Dei-Dei Market, Abuja said sufficient supply was responsible for the drop. At the Dawanau Market, Kano, the situation was not different as prices of a 100kg bag of onions reduced slightly, currently ranging from N8,000 to N9,000 as against N10,000 sold initially. A trader, Mumuin, who sells the produce at the Dawanau Market, Kano, in chat with our correspondent, linked the fall to seasonal factors. That of Maikarfi Market, Kaduna, also witnessed a downward trend of 15 per cent, especially with prices of a 100kg bag of the commodity currently going for between N10,000 and N10,500 down from N15,000 sold in January. In Gombe Main Market, prices of the commodity were quite lower than that of Kaduna as a 100kg bag of onions declined to between N8,500 and N8,700 from  N10,000 sold earlier of which many of the traders were happy as they linked the situation to season of abundance. At the Ogbeogologo Market, Asaba, the  situation was not dissimilar except that prices of the commodity despite the decline, were higher than what was obtainable in the North, owing to high cost of logistics, which most of the traders opined had to  reflect in the prices, for them to make profit. Prices of a 100kg bag of onions at the Ogbeogologo Market, Asaba, declined by over 20 percent, currently selling for between N18,000 and N20,000 as against  N23,000 formerly sold, signifying a 22 percent  reduction. Madam Rose Egbuna who retails the commodity at the Ogbeogologo Market, Asaba, ascribed the decrease to adequate supply usually associated with the season of plenty. She was also hopeful that prices of the commodity would decline further during mass harvesting. For Ose Market, Onitsha, prices of the commodity witnessed a downward trend of over 20 percent as a 100kg bag of onions currently ranges from N16,000 to N18,000 down from N20, 000, it previously sold. Many of the traders linked the decrease to improved supply and availability. In Oba Market, Benin City, prices of a 100kg bag of onions reduced sharply to between N13,000 and N15,000 from N18,000 sold in March. This, however, depends on the size of the bag and the haggling power of the customer. Mr. Saleh Abu, who sells commodity in large quantities at the Oba Market, Benin City, in a chat with DAILY INDEPENDENT, linked the decline to on-season effect and low patronage. Visit to Lafenwa Market, Ogun State, revealed that prices of bag of onions  which fell to between N15,000 and N16,000 last month reduced  further, currently ranging from N12,000  to  N13,000, depending on the size and bargaining power of the buyer. The same could be said for that of Bodija Market, Ibadan, especially with prices of a 100kg bag of onions dropping within the region of N12,000 and N13,000 as against N17,000 initially sold. Most of the traders attributed the situation to on-season effect and adequate supply. In Lagos, visit to popular Mile 12 Market, indicated that prices were at a downward trend owing to increased supply and availability. Also the number of trucks offloading the consignment increased such that there was not enough space and this usually occurs during the period of bumper harvest. A 100kg bag of onions that previously went for between N14,000 and N16,000  at the Mile 12 Market, Lagos, last month,  reduced to between N10,000 and N12,000, a  29 percent decrease but this depends on the size of the bag and the negotiating power of the buyer. Mr. Peter Nwosu, a trader at the Mile 12 Market, said increased supply especially from neighbouring countries like Niger and Chad were the principal cause of the drop. Consumers who bought the commodity in smaller quantities could also feel the positive impact the decline had on their purchases.

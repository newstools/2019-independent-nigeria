AWKA – Hon. E.C. Eze, Chairman of Board of Governors, and Nze C. Umeanozie, Chairman of Parents/Teachers Association (PTA) of God’s Own Secondary School, Umuchu in Aguata Local Government Area of Anambra State, have sent a Save Our Soul (SOS) to President Muhammadu Buhari, the Minister of Education as well as the National Assembly on the  fate of 29 students of the school whose names were not uploaded by West African Examination Council (WAEC) to participate in this year’s council examination. The school has also retained the services of B. S. Nwankwo (SAN) to help it drive the point home to WAEC. In its petition, the school said it paid the council’s examination fees amounting to N739,350 through First Bank Plc, Ekwulobia,  for 53 students of the school and was issued receipts numbers 265698 and 2656789. However, on March 1, 2019, the cyber café charged to upload the students’ record to WAEC server was only able to upload 24 students before it shut down, thus leaving 29 of the students un-uploaded. Following this development, the School Principal, Mr. C. P. Anyikwa, went to WAEC Office in Awka and Lagos to have the rest of the students uploaded for the examination to no avail. Anyikwa said that he had been to Lagos Office of WAEC four times, pleading that their server be opened and the 29 students be enrolled for the examination to no avail. He said that the Deputy Registrar of the examination council, Mr. Oljide Adibayo, would always say that his boss, Mr. Pius I. Adenipekun, who is the head of National Office travelled abroad. Anyikwa lamented that the first of the examination which is Marketing was sat for on April 8 without the affected students taking part. He pleaded with WAEC to upload the students’ server before the rest of the examinations which resumes on April 22 after Easter break.

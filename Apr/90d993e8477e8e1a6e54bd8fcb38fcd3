The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) in Ogun, has issued a six months notice to gas plant owners to evacuate all Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) plants domiciled in filling stations or face sanctions. The Operations Controller in the state, Mrs Muinat Bello-Zagi, made this disclosure at a meeting with members of the Independent Petroleum Marketers of Nigeria (IPMAN), Ijebu Zone, on Wednesday in Abeokuta. Bello-Zagi said that the directive, which came via a memo from the national headquarters, stated that all filling stations with existing LPG facility popularly known as “Add-On” without necessary approval should as a matter of urgency evacuate their plants. She warned that within the six months, which served as a period of evacuation plans, no sales should be made just as all plans should be made known to the DPR for necessary approval. The controller said the memo also directed “all applications for LPG Add-On facili
ties for the refilling of gas cylinders in retail outlets should not be received henceforth”.
